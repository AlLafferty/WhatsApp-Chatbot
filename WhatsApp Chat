[15/10/2022, 09:17:03] Alice Lafferty: Hello, it's Alice from OKC. 

I was just thinking about where we could meet that's not too much of a hike for either of us, if you're still interested. Somewhere like Waltham Abbey would be roughly equidistant, but is there anything to do there? Unlikely. What do you think?
[15/10/2022, 09:51:49] Alex Regueiro: Hey Alice. üòä I was thinking about that too. Waltham Abbey is well placed but yeah not terribly exciting. Depends what you fancy doing‚Ä¶ Could have a walk around somewhere nice, or find a cafe, if you‚Äôd prefer casual. Alternatively I‚Äôd be up for something cultural in central London.
[17/10/2022, 13:49:05] Alex Regueiro: How was your weekend?
[23/10/2022, 13:41:43] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I‚Äôm going to assume you lost interest for whatever reason‚Ä¶ Take care.
[24/10/2022, 08:04:29] Alice Lafferty: I'm sorry for not getting back to you, that was poor show.
[24/10/2022, 08:16:00] Alice Lafferty: I should have mentioned earlier, but I have very little experience in dating (ie. none), and I was anxious about following through on my suggestion to meet up. 

For what it's worth, I don't mind coming up to Epping one evening this week if you'd still like to see me? Maybe you know a nice pub? I completely understand if not.
[24/10/2022, 17:34:06] Alex Regueiro: I did wonder if it was that! I understand, no worries. üôÇ
[24/10/2022, 17:39:32] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely, that sounds lovely.
[24/10/2022, 17:44:08] Alex Regueiro: And it's kind of you to offer to come this way. I'm not actually in Epping town (it's a big forest) but Epping is a pretty nice place with a few good pubs, so we could do that. Would somewhere like Woodford be easier for you though? Let me have a think about pubs in the meanwhile.
[24/10/2022, 17:50:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and I'm free Thursday/Friday evening this week, if either works for you?
[24/10/2022, 19:25:40] Alice Lafferty: I really don't know those areas too well, so I'm happy for you to decide? I think Woodford is only slightly closer so it's not a big deal.
[24/10/2022, 19:26:01] Alice Lafferty: Thursday evening would be good.
[25/10/2022, 01:20:19] Alex Regueiro: Great
[25/10/2022, 01:21:37] Alex Regueiro: So, there's the Forest Gate in Epping which I have a good memory of, though I haven't been there in ages. https://goo.gl/maps/7PqoLbakT4PZ4YH16
[25/10/2022, 01:23:45] Alex Regueiro: Or we could do the Royal Oak in Highams Park, if you'd prefer? https://goo.gl/maps/2uXKDsrCxHsA3BCcA
[25/10/2022, 01:28:22] Alex Regueiro: I'd say they're both pleasant, unpretentious, and traditional (especially Forest Gate). Hope that's your style too! Happy to suggest something else all the same.
[25/10/2022, 01:34:27] Alex Regueiro: Shall we say 8:00 or something? Presuming you were just thinking drinks.
[25/10/2022, 01:36:19] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, chat soon, good night. Hope you're sleeping well.
[25/10/2022, 10:27:00] Alice Lafferty: Forest Gate looks nice? And yes 8pm works.
[25/10/2022, 10:28:15] Alice Lafferty: Do you mind if we speak on the phone before then? Could I call you later on?
[25/10/2022, 15:30:17] Alex Regueiro: Perfect, let‚Äôs do that.
[25/10/2022, 15:32:20] Alex Regueiro: Certainly. When works for you? I‚Äôm playing tennis from 8:00 tonight, but before is fine. Or even after.
[25/10/2022, 22:06:08] Alex Regueiro: Shall we speak tomorrow then? Just let me know when you were thinking.
[25/10/2022, 23:08:38] Alice Lafferty: Hopefully some time tomorrow evening so long as you're not busy
[25/10/2022, 23:09:23] Alex Regueiro: Sure, that works for me.
[25/10/2022, 23:11:51] Alex Regueiro: Will be out for dinner locally but that won‚Äôt be long.
[26/10/2022, 20:15:27] Alex Regueiro: I'm around FYI üôÇ
[27/10/2022, 19:29:14] Alex Regueiro: See you in a bit!
[27/10/2022, 19:30:58] Alice Lafferty: I should arrive in 10ish minutes but just realised I forgot my ID. Stupendous
[27/10/2022, 19:43:04] Alex Regueiro: Hah no worries. We‚Äôll work something out.
[27/10/2022, 19:43:36] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll probably be there just before 8:00.
[27/10/2022, 19:45:19] Alice Lafferty: I think so. You can still get a drink and I should be allowed to just sit with you.
[27/10/2022, 19:46:49] Alex Regueiro: Did you get a table already?
[27/10/2022, 19:48:42] Alice Lafferty: No, I'm just loitering outside...
[27/10/2022, 19:48:48] Alice Lafferty: It's pretty quiet
[27/10/2022, 19:51:32] Alex Regueiro: üëçüèª
[27/10/2022, 19:52:32] Alex Regueiro: Sorry to keep you waiting. Shouldn‚Äôt be long now.
[27/10/2022, 19:53:37] Alice Lafferty: Not at all, I was early
[27/10/2022, 19:59:15] Alex Regueiro: 1 min away now
[27/10/2022, 20:01:16] Alex Regueiro: You inside?
[28/10/2022, 00:50:17] Alice Lafferty: At home. I had a really nice time, thank you again for the drinks.
[28/10/2022, 01:04:30] Alex Regueiro: Ah good. I got lucky with the train too.
[28/10/2022, 01:05:18] Alex Regueiro: You're welcome.
[28/10/2022, 01:06:23] Alex Regueiro: Likewise, was really enjoyable üôÇ
[28/10/2022, 01:07:16] Alex Regueiro: Hope the drink's worn off. Good night!
[28/10/2022, 18:21:54] Alice Lafferty: Thanks.
[28/10/2022, 18:22:05] Alice Lafferty: I've ordered a copy of The Emperor's New Mind.
[28/10/2022, 19:40:23] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. I‚Äôll be really curious what you think of it.
[28/10/2022, 19:40:51] Alex Regueiro: Are you reading anything right now? Don‚Äôt think I asked.
[29/10/2022, 19:14:31] Alice Lafferty: Well, I'm kind of half following along with my degree course so I'm reading some Theology stuff.
[29/10/2022, 19:14:42] Alice Lafferty: Also Herman Hesse (fiction)
[29/10/2022, 19:16:00] Alice Lafferty: As you were saying, one of Joni Mitchell's subtly anti-hippie songs: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mQc-reJOQ8A
[29/10/2022, 19:16:17] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I'm not a huge texter.
[29/10/2022, 20:34:10] Alex Regueiro: No need to apologise. I'm used to texting for various reasons, but I really don't enjoy it.
[29/10/2022, 20:34:20] Alex Regueiro: Sort of a default mode
[29/10/2022, 20:35:33] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, you did say! Glass Bead Game, was it? Alas, even Steppenwolf has been on my to-read list for years
[29/10/2022, 20:37:54] Alex Regueiro: I don't think I know that one. Will have a listen, thanks. üôÇ
[29/10/2022, 20:39:12] Alex Regueiro: I know you said you weren't a big fan of Uriah Heep when you had a listen, but in honour of Epping (their lead singer Dave Byron came from there), and moreover because it's a great song, do listen to Lady in Black... if you haven't already.
[29/10/2022, 20:39:13] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2a8fuTEpqw
[29/10/2022, 20:51:42] Alice Lafferty: Yes! I'm enjoying it.
[29/10/2022, 20:51:53] Alice Lafferty: Ok am listening now
[29/10/2022, 20:54:53] Alice Lafferty: Ok you've brought me over to Uriah Heep. Is the rest of Downunda similar?
[29/10/2022, 20:56:54] Alice Lafferty: I remember now that I listened to Demons and Wizards because I like the album art.
[29/10/2022, 20:57:56] Alex Regueiro: Haha excellent!
[29/10/2022, 20:57:58] Alex Regueiro: hmm
[29/10/2022, 20:58:23] Alex Regueiro: I think you'd like Come away Melinda on that album
[29/10/2022, 21:00:43] Alex Regueiro: The other stuff is a bit heavier, though Gypsy is a good track
[29/10/2022, 21:00:54] Alex Regueiro: You'll be a Heepster in time üôÇ

[29/10/2022, 21:03:15] Alex Regueiro: Ahah spooky. I said I didn't have clairvoyance but maybe one of us does...
[29/10/2022, 21:03:17] Alice Lafferty: I do like this song.
[29/10/2022, 21:03:24] Alex Regueiro: or maybe it's just the time of year
[29/10/2022, 21:03:43] Alice Lafferty: Right. Are you doing anything for Halloween?
[29/10/2022, 21:04:39] Alex Regueiro: July Morning is their masterpiece, though I suspect the second part might be a bit too crazy for you.
[29/10/2022, 21:04:49] Alex Regueiro: Nope. You?
[29/10/2022, 21:05:41] Alice Lafferty: I will try. They kind of remind me of The Moody Blues
[29/10/2022, 21:06:13] Alex Regueiro: It's great. Very acerbic, but nice song too.
[29/10/2022, 21:07:14] Alex Regueiro: They truly have a range of style, but some of their stuff is definitely in that mould.
[29/10/2022, 21:08:04] Alice Lafferty: No. My dad disapproves of the whole autumn sequence of holidays because he believes 1) Halloween is a corruption of All Hallows & All Saints day, 2) Guy Fawkes night 'stokes anti-Catholic sentiment'.
[29/10/2022, 21:08:06] Alice Lafferty: Go figure.
[29/10/2022, 21:08:44] Alex Regueiro: Interesting! Halloween is also Reformation Day, I just learnt from my Calvinist friend.
[29/10/2022, 21:09:12] Alice Lafferty: Plus I've fallen out of touch with most people I knew in London so I wouldn't have anywhere to go anyway.
‚Äé[29/10/2022, 21:09:38] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/10/2022, 21:09:40] Alice Lafferty: Right, publication of the 95 theses.
[29/10/2022, 21:09:51] Alex Regueiro: I don't really do the whole meme thing, but a Catholic friend posted that. Kind of amusing.
[29/10/2022, 21:09:55] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[29/10/2022, 21:10:01] Alice Lafferty: Your friend is a true and true calvinist? He actually believes in 'the elect and the reprobate' etc
[29/10/2022, 21:10:46] Alice Lafferty: I'm quite tolerant but Calvinism is kind of insane
[29/10/2022, 21:11:50] Alex Regueiro: He does. I find that side crazy but he's actually a very tolerant and fair-minded guy otherwise.
[29/10/2022, 21:11:51] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[29/10/2022, 21:12:08] Alex Regueiro: I'd surely be an Arminian if I were Protestant
[29/10/2022, 21:12:37] Alice Lafferty: It's strange because predestination seems to remove the incentive to act ethically. To some extent.
[29/10/2022, 21:12:46] Alice Lafferty: Or attend church or do anything really
[29/10/2022, 21:13:00] Alice Lafferty: Same
[29/10/2022, 21:13:25] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, I find its conflict with free will (that's a whole other subject that I have strong views on) and the idea of God's grace is too difficult to resolve, personally
[29/10/2022, 21:13:30] Alice Lafferty: My overwhelming impression from studying the history of Christianity is that all of the heretics were correct.
[29/10/2022, 21:14:02] Alice Lafferty: You might be interested in reading Pelagius
[29/10/2022, 21:14:04] Alex Regueiro: Haha. They really did have some excellent points often. A few wacky ones, but not many.
[29/10/2022, 21:14:32] Alex Regueiro: The Protestant Reformation might not have happened if they'd embraced the moderate reforms suggested by Wycliffe and Hus, I suspect
[29/10/2022, 21:14:46] Alex Regueiro: Thanks, I'll have a look
[29/10/2022, 21:15:13] Alice Lafferty: There was an Augustine-Pelagius show-down early on in papal history. Augustine won and we have him to thank for the doctrines of predestination, original sin, and total deprivation :)
[29/10/2022, 21:15:36] Alice Lafferty: Huge Wycliffe fan also.
[29/10/2022, 21:15:55] Alice Lafferty: Also lean Unitarian over Trinitarian.
[29/10/2022, 21:16:10] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever read the Lollard's declaration?
[29/10/2022, 21:16:50] Alex Regueiro: Unitarian is more logically consistent, but I do sympathise with those who say it's very non-orthodox Christianity.
[29/10/2022, 21:17:20] Alex Regueiro: Also, you won't have an interesting essay on the Trinity and set theory!
[29/10/2022, 21:17:33] Alex Regueiro: I haven't, but will look that up too. üôÇ
‚Äé[29/10/2022, 21:17:47] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/10/2022, 21:18:04] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I feel like I'm setting you homework or something.
[29/10/2022, 21:18:11] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I really need to watch the series Sea of Faith. It's been on my Youtube watchlist for a few months. Do you know it?
[29/10/2022, 21:19:48] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes! I remember listening to a podcast episode on that. It resonated. Can't help but think they foresaw the   Catholic child sexual abuse scandal too.
[29/10/2022, 21:20:11] Alice Lafferty: I don't, I'm going to look it up.
[29/10/2022, 21:20:13] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. I am your keen and willing student on this subject.
[29/10/2022, 21:21:27] Alex Regueiro: It discusses the ideas of the theologians and philosophers of religion across the history of Christianity. BBC series from the 80s when they were still turning out quality.
[29/10/2022, 21:21:31] Alice Lafferty: Definitely. Also the witch trials, selling of indulges, simony etc.
[29/10/2022, 21:21:50] Alice Lafferty: If I was to start a sect it would be Lollardly in fashion definitely.
[29/10/2022, 21:22:02] Alex Regueiro: Yep, though the witch hunts were almost entirely Protestant I understand.
[29/10/2022, 21:22:31] Alex Regueiro: You can sign me up if you do üòâ
[29/10/2022, 21:23:16] Alice Lafferty: Yes. That's why imo it's wrong to call Wycliffe proto-Protestant because he would have been extremely critical of Protestantism's later trajectory.
[29/10/2022, 21:23:57] Alex Regueiro: I have to admit I have a little sympathy for your dad. I remember learning about the Gunpowder Plot in school and secretly rooting for Guy Fawkes and Catesby.
[29/10/2022, 21:24:08] Alex Regueiro: Good point that
[29/10/2022, 21:24:28] Alex Regueiro: James I was a bit of a nutter in some ways. Wrote a book on witches, I'm sure you know.
[29/10/2022, 21:24:50] Alice Lafferty: I think they were all Oxford based too. I really dithered over applying to Oxford for this reason.
[29/10/2022, 21:25:11] Alice Lafferty: Plus High Anglicanism.
[29/10/2022, 21:25:59] Alex Regueiro: I think you're right. And I was just going to say, the Newman & co association would make your dad happier too.
[29/10/2022, 21:26:51] Alice Lafferty: Yes. My take is that Protestantism and Catholicism both manifest themselves in quite distinct forms of craziness. Puritanism and decadence, respectively.
[29/10/2022, 21:27:34] Alex Regueiro: I totally agree. Glad to hear it from someone who actually knows theology and the history!
[29/10/2022, 21:28:25] Alice Lafferty: I suspect that had they succeeded the gunpowder plotters may just have installed their own Catholic theocracy, so... a case of picking your poison.
[29/10/2022, 21:28:39] Alex Regueiro: My heritage is a real mixture of Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, Calvinists. Only fair that my views should reflect them eh? (And distantly a few Jews!)
[29/10/2022, 21:29:16] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, most likely. I was still nominally Catholic back then though. Truth is I was torn. Same thing with the Civil War.
[29/10/2022, 21:30:11] Alice Lafferty: Newman makes his uncomfortable I think because he proves just how much slippage there is between Catholicism and higher forms of Anglicanism!
[29/10/2022, 21:31:50] Alice Lafferty: Have you looked very much into your family history? It would be interesting to see if there were any conversions upon marriage. It was quite common, and a good indication of which was the 'dominant' religion at the time.
[29/10/2022, 21:31:56] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's quite true. Anglicanism suffers because of its origin. Henry VIII essentially died a Catholic when it comes to theology, as I understand. Totally pragmatic/cynical from him to branch off. I think the tension's always been there.
[29/10/2022, 21:32:43] Alex Regueiro: Quite a lot. Some branches more than others. It's a monumental task... hard to keep it "just" a hobby. Have you?
[29/10/2022, 21:33:02] Alex Regueiro: Only seen inter-Christian conversions upon marriage so far
[29/10/2022, 21:33:28] Alice Lafferty: Right. Protestants 'all come crawling back eventually...' as my dad would say.
[29/10/2022, 21:33:41] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[29/10/2022, 21:34:28] Alex Regueiro: I've met quite a few Anglican to Catholic converts. Naturally quite disenchanted with the feebleness of the contemporary Church of England.
[29/10/2022, 21:34:33] Alice Lafferty: No, although my aunt and uncle were quite into it at one point. Basically revealed Irish/English as far as the eye can see on my dad's side.
[29/10/2022, 21:35:02] Alex Regueiro: right
[29/10/2022, 21:35:29] Alice Lafferty: My maternal grandfather was from a Polish Jewish family who came over after the pogroms I believe.
[29/10/2022, 21:35:56] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. Early 1900s eh?
[29/10/2022, 21:36:22] Alex Regueiro: Irish family history is super difficult to trace. From an ethnic and religious perspective though, it's a really interesting side for me.
[29/10/2022, 21:37:00] Alice Lafferty: So you are a little bit Jewish? Do you know what the migration patterns were there?
[29/10/2022, 21:37:52] Alex Regueiro: To be honest I know almost nothing, except a couple of the surnames on my Italian side suggest the families were originally Jewish. Not on my Spanish side funnily enough.
[29/10/2022, 21:38:17] Alice Lafferty: What we do know is that both families survived and stayed behind during the potato famine. Also migrated turn of the century to London from County Laois.
[29/10/2022, 21:38:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[29/10/2022, 21:39:09] Alex Regueiro: I see. My Irish ancestors were similar. Left in the 1880s, well after the famine. From the SW and SE.
[29/10/2022, 21:39:19] Alice Lafferty: And then my grandfather was born and raised in Ireland and only migrated in the 60s.
[29/10/2022, 21:39:54] Alice Lafferty: I think a lot of Europeans have this extremely patchworked ancestry.
[29/10/2022, 21:40:19] Alice Lafferty: And all suffered from the most virulent strain of Catholicism.
[29/10/2022, 21:40:32] Alex Regueiro: My great-grandmother was of entirely German heritage and she did all her family history. She wrote out all the branches who married Jews. üò¨
[29/10/2022, 21:40:38] Alex Regueiro: definitely
[29/10/2022, 21:41:02] Alice Lafferty: Ok, county Laois is kind of central/sw
[29/10/2022, 21:41:05] Alex Regueiro: I have Calvinists who were prosecuted by Lutherans, Catholics prosecuted by Anglicans...
[29/10/2022, 21:41:18] Alex Regueiro: errrr, persecuted
[29/10/2022, 21:41:40] Alice Lafferty: Oh no
[29/10/2022, 21:42:01] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Queen's County, as I recall. After Mary I.
[29/10/2022, 21:42:04] Alice Lafferty: Yeah those Lutherans are famously litigious.
[29/10/2022, 21:42:33] Alice Lafferty: You know, I've never actually been.
[29/10/2022, 21:43:06] Alice Lafferty: This is why it's so interesting when they inter-marry. Who had to cede their religion?
[29/10/2022, 21:43:17] Alex Regueiro: I messed that up somehow. My mind's a bit foggy. They were Calvinists prosecuted by Catholic French/Spanish who fled to England.
[29/10/2022, 21:43:21] Alice Lafferty: Actually it was probably just a case of who was marrying into the wealthier family.
[29/10/2022, 21:43:33] Alex Regueiro: Wasn't very happy when my uncle married a Jew and converted, to say the least!
[29/10/2022, 21:43:54] Alex Regueiro: Yep. So often determined by class/prestige
[29/10/2022, 21:45:03] Alice Lafferty: To be fair England has a strong pluralistic tradition. So we get the motley crew of religious and ethnic exiles etc. It's nice.
[29/10/2022, 21:45:59] Alice Lafferty: But nobody in your close family is still practising?
[29/10/2022, 21:46:03] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I've always admired that. Having an identity and traditions of your own is important IMO, but British pluralism is great
[29/10/2022, 21:46:48] Alex Regueiro: Not parents. Even grandparents were pretty lapsed by the time I knew them. Your mum's not religious I take it?
[29/10/2022, 21:47:41] Alice Lafferty: No, and she privately makes fun of my dad's family.
[29/10/2022, 21:48:16] Alice Lafferty: Trying to give you a flavour... my grandparents do a decade of the rosary every time they get on a motorway.
[29/10/2022, 21:48:54] Alex Regueiro: Haha I see.
[29/10/2022, 21:48:58] Alex Regueiro: Wow
[29/10/2022, 21:49:28] Alex Regueiro: That's hardcore Irish Catholicism
[29/10/2022, 21:49:59] Alice Lafferty: Yes. It doesn't get more hardcore almost anywhere else in the world.
[29/10/2022, 21:50:09] Alex Regueiro: My parents married at Westminster Cathedral and I think it went downhill from there.
[29/10/2022, 21:50:40] Alice Lafferty: It's ingrained in some way, I briefly get anxious about unbaptised infants and stuff like that.
[29/10/2022, 21:51:45] Alex Regueiro: Spain and Italy used to be very Catholic but it's weakened so much. Even my great-grandparents from there were quite moderate to be honest. It's fascinating seeing the evolution of religiosity in families though.
[29/10/2022, 21:52:02] Alice Lafferty: I didn't even know you could get married there. It's like the seat of the Catholic church in the UK.
[29/10/2022, 21:52:07] Alice Lafferty: Pretty nice
[29/10/2022, 21:52:52] Alex Regueiro: Oh, that really is ingrained.
[29/10/2022, 21:53:19] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, at least you could in the 80s. Nice neo-Byzantine architecture and nice priest, at least.
[29/10/2022, 21:53:53] Alice Lafferty: Yes. It's just wealth & cosmopolitanism that drive out religion.
[29/10/2022, 21:54:19] Alice Lafferty: Like most Catholic congregations in the UK I've noticed are made up almost entirely of people from immigrant communities.
[29/10/2022, 21:54:41] Alice Lafferty: And that will fade as they become more affluent.
[29/10/2022, 21:54:41] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much. Science to some extent, but I wouldn't want to overplay it
[29/10/2022, 21:54:45] Alex Regueiro: exactly
[29/10/2022, 21:55:43] Alex Regueiro: Now the issue is for so many people, lack of an alternative moral framework or tradition to ground themselves. Cue discussion of God is Dead, etc., but that's a matter for another time!
[29/10/2022, 21:56:33] Alice Lafferty: I would be interested in finding out more about my genetic makeup for health reasons too. I don't know whether you know your haplogroup, or didn't get that detailed.
[29/10/2022, 21:57:13] Alex Regueiro: You should definitely do that. I did a couple of tests a while ago, for both health reasons and curiosity about ancestry and whatnot.
[29/10/2022, 21:58:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes (going to put my scold's hat on). Moral and cultural relativism, nihilism and hedonism. Ok finished with the scolding.
[29/10/2022, 21:58:43] Alex Regueiro: I did research my haplogroups. Genetic anthropology is really interesting.
[29/10/2022, 21:58:54] Alice Lafferty: I kind of mistrust those genetics companies. '23 and me' or something like that?
[29/10/2022, 21:59:15] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes, all that jazz. We probably agree so will nip that topic in the bud this time.
[29/10/2022, 21:59:43] Alex Regueiro: Most of them are bollocks, but 23andMe is pretty good, as long as you know what bits to be sceptical about
[29/10/2022, 22:00:17] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I don't mind at all but why is it exactly that you're so reluctant to discuss politics?
[29/10/2022, 22:00:37] Alice Lafferty: I guess if two people already agree than it can just become like intellectual masturbation.
[29/10/2022, 22:01:47] Alex Regueiro: I'm not reluctant per se, especially now that I have a taste for your views. Just that we could go down a rabbit hole, and I'd rather talk about other stuff for now.
[29/10/2022, 22:02:00] Alex Regueiro: I'll gladly have that discussion at some point, mind you. üòÑ
[29/10/2022, 22:02:09] Alice Lafferty: How much information do they give you? Do they tell you your susceptibility to certain illnesses etc?
[29/10/2022, 22:02:23] Alice Lafferty: Ok, that's fine
[29/10/2022, 22:02:45] Alex Regueiro: It certainly can. I think we're both clever enough to avoid it, but I do loathe that sort of tone.
[29/10/2022, 22:03:13] Alex Regueiro: Yep, lots of indicators like that
[29/10/2022, 22:03:27] Alice Lafferty: I know that I carry Factor V Leiden, which is a mild blood clotting disorder. I'd be interested to know more.
[29/10/2022, 22:03:35] Alex Regueiro: 23andMe is best for health, but its ancestry breakdown is really good too.
[29/10/2022, 22:04:17] Alex Regueiro: Ah right. It shouldn't affect you in normal circumstances though, I hope?
[29/10/2022, 22:04:19] Alice Lafferty: We should probably anticipate an entire new genetic consultancy industry, who'll advise on like diet and lifestyle based on genetic risk factors.
[29/10/2022, 22:05:02] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely. It's already started, mainly in the US I think. Then there's countries like France which ban it outright in a very paranoid sort of way.
[29/10/2022, 22:06:24] Alice Lafferty: No, it's not very serious. Well, having said that my father had a small stroke at only 52, we believe due to that. I will just need to be extra watchful of my blood pressure, cholesterol etc :)
[29/10/2022, 22:06:48] Alice Lafferty: And I can't take hormonal birth control because of the compounded risk of blood clotting.
[29/10/2022, 22:07:16] Alex Regueiro: I have to be watchful of my cholesterol too. The DNA test didn't flag up anything, but I know it runs in my mum's family. Her dad died in his 60s from a heart attack, wasn't even overweight or anything.
[29/10/2022, 22:07:36] Alex Regueiro: Your dad made a full recovery though, it seems?
[29/10/2022, 22:08:28] Alex Regueiro: Sounds like you're at least well-informed and balanced re your condition
[29/10/2022, 22:08:54] Alice Lafferty: On second thought, it does make an entire genetic write-up seem redundant. You can just look at your close relatives and get an idea of what you're predisposed to.
[29/10/2022, 22:09:32] Alex Regueiro: Somewhat. Inheritance of genes is so random though, it's sometimes good to confirm whether you actually got the variant.
[29/10/2022, 22:09:36] Alice Lafferty: Right, the scary part is when people with seemingly good lifestyle habits die prematurely.
[29/10/2022, 22:10:08] Alice Lafferty: Yes, although he is blind in one eye though! TIA in optic nerve. He's on lots of meds now.
[29/10/2022, 22:10:20] Alex Regueiro: Plus you can find out exactly how Jewish you are by blood. It's one of those things can be measured very accurately, at least for Ashkenazim!
[29/10/2022, 22:10:27] Alex Regueiro: Oh dear. Sorry to hear.
[29/10/2022, 22:10:32] Alice Lafferty: Thank you. Honestly I don't think about it much, I just mentioned it because we were talking about genetics.
[29/10/2022, 22:11:00] Alex Regueiro: That's fair
[29/10/2022, 22:11:11] Alice Lafferty: He's fine really. Factor V does not statistically reduce life expectancy or anything like that.
[29/10/2022, 22:11:53] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I'd be interested in doing that. I know certain cancers are more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews.
[29/10/2022, 22:11:55] Alex Regueiro: One day when you're famous you can get featured on http://www.jewornotjew.com. It's quite an entertaining browse, if you haven't seen it before.
[29/10/2022, 22:13:01] Alice Lafferty: This is hilarious.
[29/10/2022, 22:13:07] Alice Lafferty: I wonder what my 'Jew score' is
[29/10/2022, 22:13:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, lots of endogamy to thank. On the flip side, high intelligence and long life are also prevalent!
‚Äé[29/10/2022, 22:14:14] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/10/2022, 22:14:26] Alice Lafferty: Sean Penn is apparently a 'borderline Jew'
[29/10/2022, 22:14:31] Alex Regueiro: -10 for being a pale redhead? üòÄ
[29/10/2022, 22:14:54] Alice Lafferty: Exactly.
[29/10/2022, 22:14:59] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I've heard
[29/10/2022, 22:15:12] Alice Lafferty: Although interestingly red hair was associated with Jews during the Spanish inquisition.
[29/10/2022, 22:15:22] Alex Regueiro: That's a good one. The funniest are the "thankfully not a Jew" and "sadly not a Jew" ones.
[29/10/2022, 22:15:33] Alex Regueiro: Oh really? Didn't know that. Curious
[29/10/2022, 22:15:53] Alice Lafferty: Judas Iscariot is often depicted with red hair. It's basically 'sign of the devil'.
[29/10/2022, 22:15:55] Alex Regueiro: In honesty (European) Jews are a really diverse lot in terms of appearance
[29/10/2022, 22:16:00] Alex Regueiro: aha
[29/10/2022, 22:16:09] Alice Lafferty: Red hair and Jewish... I'm doing double time hereüòî
[29/10/2022, 22:16:46] Alex Regueiro: Haha, so it seems...
[29/10/2022, 22:16:58] Alex Regueiro: But in my books you're doing well!
[29/10/2022, 22:17:53] Alice Lafferty: Very true. Shepardi Jews look Arabic basically.
[29/10/2022, 22:18:06] Alice Lafferty: *separdi
[29/10/2022, 22:18:15] Alice Lafferty: *sephardi
[29/10/2022, 22:18:16] Alice Lafferty: !!
[29/10/2022, 22:18:22] Alex Regueiro: hah
[29/10/2022, 22:18:23] Alice Lafferty: Phew
[29/10/2022, 22:18:29] Alex Regueiro: I think that might because of the countries they live in now though, no?
[29/10/2022, 22:18:55] Alex Regueiro: Jewish genetic history is really interesting. Sephardim mixed a lot more with the native Christian population than Ashkenazim, so I think most originally looked basically like Spaniards/Portuguese.
[29/10/2022, 22:18:57] Alice Lafferty: Have mediterranean admixture now yes.
[29/10/2022, 22:19:09] Alex Regueiro: Then they fled to Italy, North Africa, Turkey, Holland, etc.
[29/10/2022, 22:19:14] Alice Lafferty: Also north african/ moorish
[29/10/2022, 22:19:18] Alex Regueiro: yep
[29/10/2022, 22:19:30] Alex Regueiro: I did go through a phase I was really interested in Spinoza at one point
[29/10/2022, 22:19:41] Alice Lafferty: There are no ethnic pedigrees in Europe.
[29/10/2022, 22:19:50] Alex Regueiro: He's one of the Sephardi greats üôÇ
[29/10/2022, 22:19:54] Alex Regueiro: yeah
‚Äé[29/10/2022, 22:20:25] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/10/2022, 22:20:33] Alice Lafferty: Heretical pantheist.
[29/10/2022, 22:20:38] Alice Lafferty: I lean Leibniz.
‚Äé[29/10/2022, 22:20:45] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/10/2022, 22:20:59] Alex Regueiro: Leibniz was a cool dude. I'm still a Newton fanboy though.
[29/10/2022, 22:21:31] Alice Lafferty: Lol. Jewish card revoked
[29/10/2022, 22:21:46] Alice Lafferty: We humanities dullards do not get to study him
[29/10/2022, 22:22:02] Alex Regueiro: Apparently Montaigne was part Sephardic too. He's definitely one to claim.
[29/10/2022, 22:22:53] Alice Lafferty: I didn't know that
[29/10/2022, 22:23:43] Alice Lafferty: Is this to do with calculus?
[29/10/2022, 22:24:00] Alex Regueiro: Newton? It's a shame. Asexual heretic and alchemist, thoroughly disagreeable person, but still the greatest genius of science.
[29/10/2022, 22:24:17] Alex Regueiro: My fanboyism? (I was kidding really)
[29/10/2022, 22:24:41] Alice Lafferty: No the Leibniz-Newton controversy.
[29/10/2022, 22:24:41] Alex Regueiro: And Asperger's... err, level 1 autism spectrum!
[29/10/2022, 22:25:06] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. Yes, basically. Priority of claim to invention. They got on well at first, had a good correspondence.
[29/10/2022, 22:25:10] Alice Lafferty: Only read about it tangentially
[29/10/2022, 22:25:53] Alex Regueiro: Newton was particularly sensitive about it though. When he became president of the Royal Society he made an official declaration that he was the inventor of calculus hah.
[29/10/2022, 22:26:42] Alice Lafferty: Right Spinoza was like that as well. And Kant. These guys I think were more profoundly autistic to fall into level one. I'm going to put then in level two. When you're so intellectually gifted you horseshoe round into being functionally intellectually disabled.
[29/10/2022, 22:28:50] Alice Lafferty: Regretting again not having any proper formal maths education.
[29/10/2022, 22:29:41] Alex Regueiro: It's not too late. Hey, I could teach you! I was a private tutor for years, after all.
[29/10/2022, 22:30:26] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, sounds about right. Kant was a very odd I know, though I admire his epistemology and metaphysics. (Ethics are more dubious.)
[29/10/2022, 22:30:41] Alex Regueiro: I have a fat biography of Newton sitting on my shelf by the way. Will get around to it at some point.
[29/10/2022, 22:30:50] Alice Lafferty: What's your going rate for tuition
[29/10/2022, 22:31:11] Alice Lafferty: Anyway, I'd be worried you'd think I was slow.
[29/10/2022, 22:31:38] Alex Regueiro: It depended on the level, but ¬£45-70. I did everything from 11 year olds to university students.
[29/10/2022, 22:33:03] Alex Regueiro: For you... Another date would be payment enough!
[29/10/2022, 22:33:09] Alex Regueiro: I sincerely doubt it
[29/10/2022, 22:33:31] Alice Lafferty: I don't want to overdetermine the meaningfulness of autism, but this could . The categorical imperative would work if everyone was as rigid and scrupulous as he was ie. it does not work even in small groups, and especially not at the level of state judicial administration.
[29/10/2022, 22:33:40] Alice Lafferty: *be relevant
[29/10/2022, 22:34:24] Alex Regueiro: I think the Fable of the Bees (though a bit simplistic) is a good way to see where it fails
[29/10/2022, 22:34:43] Alice Lafferty: Forgot the true dictum that hypocrisy makes the world go round.
[29/10/2022, 22:35:20] Alice Lafferty: Agree.
[29/10/2022, 22:35:22] Alex Regueiro: I admire Kant's approach, mind you. I love how he tries to effectively justifying a Lutheran ethics on purely rational grounds, even if he ultimately fails.
[29/10/2022, 22:35:33] Alex Regueiro: justify*
[29/10/2022, 22:36:32] Alex Regueiro: But honestly, if you do fancy learning maths, I would be glad to be your guiding hand at the very least.
[29/10/2022, 22:37:28] Alice Lafferty: Similar to that (probably apocryphal) story about Communist China. A group of farmers decided to retain a surplus of the grain they produced at the end of the month, and use it themselves rather than submit it to the state. Productivity doubled once the farmers were incentivised to work for individual gain. When this scheme was ended, productivity fell again.
[29/10/2022, 22:37:43] Alice Lafferty: It's a nice just-so story for capitalism lol
[29/10/2022, 22:38:03] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Probably apocryphal indeed, but it would hardly be surprising if true
[29/10/2022, 22:39:27] Alice Lafferty: I will come to you if I have a question.
[29/10/2022, 22:39:51] Alex Regueiro: They shot themselves in the feet in so many ways. Mao's sparrow campaign makes me laugh and cry.
[29/10/2022, 22:40:43] Alex Regueiro: And don't get my going on Lysenkoism...
[29/10/2022, 22:41:20] Alice Lafferty: Wait is this the guy who tried to like revive Lamarckian genetics
[29/10/2022, 22:41:30] Alice Lafferty: Or he was doing something screwy with genetics anyway
[29/10/2022, 22:41:34] Alex Regueiro: That's the one. In the worst possible way.
[29/10/2022, 22:42:01] Alex Regueiro: Like we were saying... this is why you don't give academics too much power!
[29/10/2022, 22:42:40] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. There are so many 'fables' like that about command economies. The whale hunting one too.
[29/10/2022, 22:43:30] Alice Lafferty: We are getting dangerously close to discussing p******* again.
[29/10/2022, 22:43:39] Alex Regueiro: Hah!
[29/10/2022, 22:43:52] Alice Lafferty: Hm, it deleted some of my *s.
[29/10/2022, 22:44:01] Alice Lafferty: Anyway.
[29/10/2022, 22:44:02] Alex Regueiro: Okay, quick, hard starboard away from the iceberg...
[29/10/2022, 22:44:04] Alex Regueiro: Really?
[29/10/2022, 22:44:36] Alex Regueiro: I should probably go chill and let you relax for the night too. üôÇ
[29/10/2022, 22:44:49] Alice Lafferty: ... no philosopher king :(
[29/10/2022, 22:45:08] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Sorry if I've kept you.
[29/10/2022, 22:45:36] Alex Regueiro: I used to like that idea of Plato's at one point. Oh so naive. Then I learnt what a pernicious authoritarian bent he had.
[29/10/2022, 22:46:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[29/10/2022, 22:46:43] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. It's been good fun. I was just wary of texting too much, since you're (quite rightly) not a fan.
[29/10/2022, 22:47:29] Alice Lafferty: It's fine, I don't mind. I'm just never sure how quickly people expect a reply.
[29/10/2022, 22:47:47] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to go and listen to some more Uriah Heep.
[29/10/2022, 22:48:02] Alex Regueiro: It depends on the message, but generally I'm not bothered if it takes a day or two.
[29/10/2022, 22:49:13] Alex Regueiro: As long as you don't play the game of deliberately keeping the other on tenterhooks. üôÑ
[29/10/2022, 22:49:30] Alice Lafferty: By the way I apologise that I still have very much an 'undergrad' understanding of phil & pol
[29/10/2022, 22:49:32] Alex Regueiro: That's driven me nuts before. But I know you're not that type
[29/10/2022, 22:49:37] Alice Lafferty: So thank you for humouring me.
[29/10/2022, 22:50:20] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. I'm frankly impressed. And trust me, my own knowledge of philosophy is extremely patchy.
[29/10/2022, 22:50:56] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I've had that a lot as well.
[29/10/2022, 22:51:13] Alex Regueiro: Would you like me to make you a playlist? Of Uriah Heep or anything else. Prog, classical, old school R&B, you name it...
[29/10/2022, 22:51:36] Alice Lafferty: I guess some people actually derive enjoyment from the cat and mouse style romantic games though.
[29/10/2022, 22:52:22] Alex Regueiro: It's the worst. I was 19 when a girl first did it to me, and I had no experience to know how to handle it. But enough of that
[29/10/2022, 22:52:54] Alice Lafferty: You can if you like, but please don't go to too much trouble. Just throw a few albums on there that you think are good.
[29/10/2022, 22:53:28] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever listened to a band called Comus?
[29/10/2022, 22:53:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I've nothing against games, but not that sort...
[29/10/2022, 22:54:01] Alex Regueiro: I haven't. I'll definitely give them a listen though
[29/10/2022, 22:54:32] Alex Regueiro: Rock/prog? Sure.
[29/10/2022, 22:54:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[29/10/2022, 22:55:17] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of folksy though and some people are really not into that.
[29/10/2022, 22:55:51] Alex Regueiro: I like folk rock. And folksy prog rock. Do you know Strawbs?
[29/10/2022, 22:56:25] Alice Lafferty: I do, I like them
[29/10/2022, 22:57:08] Alex Regueiro: Great
[29/10/2022, 22:57:09] Alex Regueiro: Part of the Union always makes me smile
[29/10/2022, 22:57:12] Alice Lafferty: Is this like bordering on the Canterbury scene stuff?
[29/10/2022, 22:57:44] Alice Lafferty: Like Soft Machine
[29/10/2022, 22:57:46] Alex Regueiro: Not too good with the history. Maybe?
[29/10/2022, 22:58:27] Alex Regueiro: Now I'm not so confident I can recommend enough stuff you haven't heard of. Maybe there's another genre you're less familiar with but want a taste...
[29/10/2022, 22:59:05] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry
[29/10/2022, 22:59:28] Alice Lafferty: I have listened widely but not deeply
[29/10/2022, 23:00:42] Alex Regueiro: I'll throw together a classical one. Particular performances. Maybe even baroque.
[29/10/2022, 23:02:07] Alice Lafferty: Ok! I'm really a noob. I've listened to the most algorithmically promoted Chopin and Liszt, that's really all.
[29/10/2022, 23:02:32] Alex Regueiro: You can always listen to some more Uriah Heep in the meanwhile!
[29/10/2022, 23:02:42] Alex Regueiro: Ah perfect. I'll work around that
[29/10/2022, 23:02:56] Alice Lafferty: Thank you
[29/10/2022, 23:02:56] Alex Regueiro: (Youtube makes it so easy)
[29/10/2022, 23:04:09] Alex Regueiro: De rien
[29/10/2022, 23:04:22] Alex Regueiro: Good night for now. I'll text you tomorrow. üôÇ
[29/10/2022, 23:05:21] Alice Lafferty: Ok, goodnight
[29/10/2022, 23:05:30] Alex Regueiro: Sleep well
[30/10/2022, 15:59:02] Alex Regueiro: Good afternoon!
[30/10/2022, 15:59:08] Alex Regueiro: As promised...
[30/10/2022, 15:59:09] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm5jJV7ZF3sZTyb_J6v0bVERH0Apayohl
[30/10/2022, 16:00:37] Alex Regueiro: It's all pre-Chopin, since you mentioned you're more familiar with his stuff. Just a smattering of a few of my favourite pieces, in reverse chronological order.
[30/10/2022, 16:01:24] Alex Regueiro: Some are quite long, so listen at your own leisure. You may have heard some of them anyway?
[30/10/2022, 16:01:52] Alex Regueiro: Hope you're enjoyed a few Uriah Heep pieces too. üòÄ
[30/10/2022, 16:09:15] Alex Regueiro: You recommended Rachmaninov Vespers didn‚Äôt you? They‚Äôre marvellous.
[30/10/2022, 18:29:17] Alex Regueiro: I'm off to my local pub quiz now. Going to try to win the ¬£400+ jackpot... wish us luck!
[30/10/2022, 19:17:27] Alice Lafferty: Thank you!
[30/10/2022, 19:19:53] Alice Lafferty: I listened to Very 'eavy... and Look At Yourself, preferred the first. I can't explain it very well but with prog, I really like it when the music is overly elaborate, has anachronistic or almost kitschy elements... Look At Yourself was kind of more 'straightforward' rock music.
[30/10/2022, 19:20:18] Alice Lafferty: :)
[30/10/2022, 19:21:20] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Tell me how you get on afterwards. I'd really like to go to one but I can't find a local pub that does one regularly.
[30/10/2022, 22:02:47] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, Very 'eavy very 'umble is a great album. July Morning is by far the best track on Look at Yourself.
[30/10/2022, 22:03:28] Alex Regueiro: I think I know what you mean about that style. You get it lot in "baroque rock".
[30/10/2022, 22:05:12] Alex Regueiro: I listened to a bit of Comus (very strange but so interesting!) and Soft Machine. I might get their compilations. Unless you recommend particular albums.
[30/10/2022, 22:06:08] Alex Regueiro: No problem. Wasn't hard to put together. Looking forward to your review.
[30/10/2022, 22:10:19] Alex Regueiro: I was thinking of including this one too. Famous baroque aria by Rameau, which you might know. But this production is so quirky and eccentric, so very French. I find it slightly bewitching! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zegtH-acXE
[30/10/2022, 22:12:13] Alex Regueiro: Alas, we didn't win. My excuse is this quiz has declined in quality the last few months and is too low brow now!
[30/10/2022, 22:13:20] Alex Regueiro: That's a shame. No weekly ones in Winchmore Hill at all?
[30/10/2022, 22:28:37] Alice Lafferty: The Herald is Comus' best song imo.
[30/10/2022, 22:28:54] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry if you don't like it and don't feel any obligation to listen to any of this stuff.
[30/10/2022, 22:29:04] Alice Lafferty: Were they good live?
[30/10/2022, 22:30:01] Alex Regueiro: Unfortunately only Mick Box from the original lineup was there. It was at a mini prog festival in London. Dave Byron (Epping guy) and Ken Hensley (died just a year ago) added so much. Their newer stuff is more metal and not nearly as good.
[30/10/2022, 22:31:34] Alex Regueiro: No no, it's good! Always nice to expand my tastes.
[30/10/2022, 22:32:11] Alice Lafferty: I hope you didn't intend for it to be listened to in a specific order... I've just been picking at random. I have listened to all of the Bach (as a companion to Godel Escher Bach). I also thought the Boccherini pieces were very beautiful.
[30/10/2022, 22:33:41] Alice Lafferty: Apparently music tastes calcify a bit when people reach around 25 years old. And they become more resistant to new stuff. I would like to make you a playlist in return but I was worried about this effect? Have you experienced it?
[30/10/2022, 22:34:28] Alice Lafferty: Haha if the quiz is even slightly weighted towards pop culture of sport, then I'm totally out.
[30/10/2022, 22:34:47] Alice Lafferty: It was no University Challenge I'm guessing.
[30/10/2022, 22:36:19] Alex Regueiro: Nope, any order is good. The playlist goes back in time, but listening to the shorter pieces first is probably a good idea. Glad you liked the Boccherini, he's an underrated composer. They're 4 movements of a string quintet, and the last is really barnstorming, but I always think one should listen to the whole thing the first time. üôÇ
[30/10/2022, 22:36:48] Alex Regueiro: Hah yeah I sympathise. So much pop culture in this one, and it kills me. Sport I know a bit, but still not good.
[30/10/2022, 22:37:56] Alex Regueiro: I'll have to get your thoughts on those UC episodes once/if you get a chance to watch them. No pressure at all though.
[30/10/2022, 22:39:22] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I'd say that's largely true with people, but I try to keep myself as open as humanly possibly by exposure to new stuff. Would love to hear whatever you have to share.
[30/10/2022, 22:39:43] Alice Lafferty: How many people on your team? The thing to do in is to recruit people with diverse specialities into your team. Best chance of winning.
[30/10/2022, 22:40:40] Alex Regueiro: 4 with me. We cover a good range but we're still a bit weak on (modern) pop culture. And you're right
[30/10/2022, 22:43:12] Alice Lafferty: I did watch one on the way home on Thursday. I was impressed by your knowledge of 18th C prime ministers...
[30/10/2022, 22:44:44] Alice Lafferty: ¬£400 is kind of high stakes. At the ones I've been to the prize was maybe a ¬£50 bar tab, at most.
[30/10/2022, 22:45:22] Alex Regueiro: It is. ¬£50 bar tab is the regular prize, and we (used to) win that pretty regularly. But there's also a jackpot that accumulates.
[30/10/2022, 22:46:08] Alice Lafferty: I think they just don't advertise very well. Or only on Facebook, which I do not use.
[30/10/2022, 22:47:33] Alex Regueiro: Hah thanks. I think they cut it but I actually said HORACE Walpole in a moment of confusion. Our captain Seb very wisely repeated just the "Walpole", but Paxo stared at him (senior moment?) so he added Horace. We had a slight kerfuffle about it off-camera but the producers agreed we should get the points for the original answer.
[30/10/2022, 22:48:02] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm building a picture of what kind of music you like, and I will make a playlist to fall in with that.
[30/10/2022, 22:48:56] Alex Regueiro: I see. Well, if you find one you like, I'm open to enlistment!
[30/10/2022, 22:49:03] Alice Lafferty: Horace Walpole... you'd have had me convinced.
[30/10/2022, 22:49:20] Alice Lafferty: Is it actually Robert?
[30/10/2022, 22:49:26] Alice Lafferty: I don't know
[30/10/2022, 22:49:30] Alex Regueiro: Exactly
[30/10/2022, 22:49:52] Alex Regueiro: Horace was his son, a famous author (Castle of Otranto)
[30/10/2022, 22:50:30] Alex Regueiro: And the builder of Strawberry Hill House, from which Strawbs took their name. I know, useless trivia.
[30/10/2022, 22:51:12] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if I'd be able to raise a 4 person team. If you ever have a free spot going for a low-value team member, I am free.
[30/10/2022, 22:51:30] Alice Lafferty: Ha I didn't know that
[30/10/2022, 22:52:07] Alice Lafferty: How many hours a day do you work usually?
[30/10/2022, 22:52:23] Alice Lafferty: I know you're kind of flexible but
[30/10/2022, 22:52:40] Alex Regueiro: Certainly. I reckon you'd be pretty good. My team members are away on holiday for 3 weeks now though. I might need to find a new team at some point, they're unavailable way too much.
[30/10/2022, 22:53:43] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[30/10/2022, 22:55:54] Alex Regueiro: At the moment very very little. The founder of the company is so preoccupied with finalising the funding round, other stuff has fallen by the wayside. It peaked at about 15 hours a week though. The rest I spend pursuing personal projects and sometimes brainstorming startup ideas with friends and acquaintances. Unfortunately the job I was going to start up this month (maths ed-tech startup, run by an ex Cambridge professor) fell through because they didn't get the grant. I consulted for them before.
[30/10/2022, 22:58:22] Alice Lafferty: (I don't mean this dismissively) that is very cushy.
[30/10/2022, 22:59:05] Alice Lafferty: Oh that's a shame.
[30/10/2022, 22:59:04] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes it is. I'm very fortunate with my financial and job situation. So much freedom (too much?). I'll tell you more some time.
[30/10/2022, 22:59:25] Alex Regueiro: What are you spending your days doing mainly? Since suspending studies that is.
[30/10/2022, 23:00:04] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's a really cool start-up. Perfect for me in several ways. And the guy who runs it is really nice, we've known each other for years now.
[30/10/2022, 23:01:21] Alice Lafferty: Tech and especially SWE is so appealing. But of course, I'm not the only one to have noticed that. Sort of get the impression that the best time to get into it was 5-10 years ago, and now the job market is oversaturated. This is what it looks like from the outside anyway.
[30/10/2022, 23:04:25] Alice Lafferty: Especially at entry level, I mean. 

At Cambridge all of the CS and maths undergrads were salivating over swe internships. The really interesting thing is that lots of mech or chem engineers are also pivoting towards tech because of remote working, pay etc.
[30/10/2022, 23:04:39] Alice Lafferty: Probably I'm just telling you stuff you already know?
[30/10/2022, 23:05:55] Alex Regueiro: Yep. And physicists and other engineers often have too. Even a mathematician-philosopher friend from Bristol did it recently. I think you're somewhat correct, but I would also stress it's a huge market and workforce, and there will always be good jobs and business opportunities in software for talented people.
[30/10/2022, 23:06:20] Alex Regueiro: I wasn't actually aware of a particular post-lockdown trend, but it makes sense.
[30/10/2022, 23:08:51] Alice Lafferty: Well, I was advised to keep up with the course at least in a half-assed way. So reading and such. Trying to decide what to do in the future, planting some late potatoes... generally moping and shirking.
[30/10/2022, 23:08:53] Alice Lafferty: :(
[30/10/2022, 23:09:44] Alice Lafferty: Right, and someone with as much experience as you will always be employable.
[30/10/2022, 23:11:37] Alice Lafferty: What I don't understand is how western job markets have managed to stem the tide of like 1B+ potential engineers from SE Asia.
[30/10/2022, 23:12:10] Alice Lafferty: It can't just be the language barrier.
[30/10/2022, 23:12:18] Alex Regueiro: I dare not be so cocksure, but I hope so. I realise how privileged I am in several ways.
[30/10/2022, 23:13:36] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. I think a lot of it is the quality of engineers they produce. The standard criticism is that they produce loads of "code monkeys" but very few special ones or so-called "10x developers". It may be exaggerated but there's some truth in it.
[30/10/2022, 23:14:23] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[30/10/2022, 23:15:12] Alex Regueiro: Language barrier plays some role. As does just the friction of outsourcing, which lots of companies learnt from in the 2000s. Funnily enough the start-up I work for has brought in developers from Italy, Australia, US, and an Indian, but they've all either relocated or are remote employees.
‚Äé[30/10/2022, 23:15:45] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[30/10/2022, 23:16:07] Alex Regueiro: I just got a notification about this. Funny, with you mentioning the Augustine-Pelagius debate the other day.
[30/10/2022, 23:16:23] Alice Lafferty: May become like law, when universities are churning out millions of graduates, but there are only a very few coveted well-salaried roles left.
[30/10/2022, 23:17:22] Alex Regueiro: I think so yeah. It's not quite that bad, but certainly the range of salary, prestige, and interesting roles within the software engineering world has enormous variation.
[30/10/2022, 23:17:33] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting. To me this just means competition is becoming steeper every day.
[30/10/2022, 23:18:06] Alice Lafferty: Yes, this question maps really well onto the Augustine-Pelagius controversy.
[30/10/2022, 23:19:08] Alice Lafferty: Interestingly it has different answers from within and from outside a theological perspective.
[30/10/2022, 23:19:44] Alice Lafferty: Rousseau was such an prancing idiot.
[30/10/2022, 23:20:01] Alex Regueiro: Don't let it put you off though. You could easily make a very employable SWE or technologist, if you take the right path now.
[30/10/2022, 23:20:21] Alex Regueiro: I wish I could go. I haven't been to one for years. Lifetime member, but that doesn't help very much if you live in London, does it?
[30/10/2022, 23:20:45] Alice Lafferty: It's nice of you to say, but not hugely meaningful because you have no idea of my abilities!
[30/10/2022, 23:21:19] Alice Lafferty: Is anybody interesting going to be speaking?
[30/10/2022, 23:21:22] Alex Regueiro: Hahah he really was. I do agree with quite a few things he wrote, but he seems full of pretence and fantasy for the most part.
[30/10/2022, 23:21:50] Alex Regueiro: Just those two guys in the picture. Neither which I know. But it still sounds like a nice debate. So many others too.
[30/10/2022, 23:22:29] Alice Lafferty: In general I believe that social norms have a 'civilising' or 'tempering' effect on people, rather than vice versa.
[30/10/2022, 23:23:59] Alex Regueiro: I thought you might say that. I don't, but I'm not sure even you know whether you have a knack for it until you try! From the little I know of you and your mind, at the very least have an aptitude and predilection for problem solving and analytic thinking. They're general skills, but a great base to build on.
[30/10/2022, 23:24:19] Alice Lafferty: But for a universe created by a perfectly good God, in order to maintain internal consistency, we must locate the corruption on the level of the social, not on the level of creation.
[30/10/2022, 23:25:09] Alice Lafferty: So my answer depends on whether I have my theology hat on or not.
[30/10/2022, 23:25:52] Alex Regueiro: For sure. I'm not sure I completely buy the Hobbesian picture of the state of nature, but there's a lot of truth in it still. It's actually quite a Christian view too, though certainly not uniquely. That our nature is inherently corrupted and we need to redeem ourselves by devotion to a higher cause. (Please excuse my ignorant religious commentary.) But I think that higher cause need not necessarily be God.
[30/10/2022, 23:26:47] Alex Regueiro: Funny you said that just as I was typing the above. Doesn't original sin and the fall of man account for corruption at an individual level though?
[30/10/2022, 23:27:25] Alice Lafferty: That is kind. I may have a go and see how easily I take to it. What programming language(s) do you recommend/use most often?
[30/10/2022, 23:28:18] Alex Regueiro: I do Rust for this startup. It's like a modern version of C++ "done right". (I used to contribute to its language design and the compiler itself, but long story.) I also do a lot of Python.
[30/10/2022, 23:28:39] Alex Regueiro: In the past plenty of C# and occasionally other stuff.
[30/10/2022, 23:28:44] Alex Regueiro: I think Python is a great language to start with.
[30/10/2022, 23:28:53] Alice Lafferty: By the way, sorry to keep talking about wearing hats. One of my tutors used it a lot to specify under what paradigm he will discuss something and I just picked it up.
[30/10/2022, 23:29:10] Alex Regueiro: I tutored it to a few kids with a decent amount of success. üôÇ
[30/10/2022, 23:29:47] Alice Lafferty: Ok, thanks. That was the general consensus from interent searches.
[30/10/2022, 23:29:51] Alex Regueiro: Hah it's fine. I use that expression too; it's handy. Though anachronistic given how little people wear hats these days!
[30/10/2022, 23:30:32] Alice Lafferty: I mean, he literally used to have ten hats in his office with post it note labels.
[30/10/2022, 23:30:57] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, do you know what they went on to do?
[30/10/2022, 23:30:57] Alex Regueiro: It depends on your background. If you were a mathematician I might recommend a functional language like Haskell, which imposes more rules and constraints (in a good way). That's what they taught first years at Imperial, even if it shocked many.
[30/10/2022, 23:30:58] Alex Regueiro: But Python is friendlier in most ways.
[30/10/2022, 23:32:00] Alex Regueiro: Not sure. Some are still in secondary school, but one (my dad's coworker-friend's son) studied something technical at a top American university. I forget the details.
[30/10/2022, 23:32:18] Alice Lafferty: The Fall is just a papering over of the more fundamental problem of evil.
[30/10/2022, 23:32:24] Alex Regueiro: Haha I miss the eccentric Oxbridge dons.
[30/10/2022, 23:33:06] Alex Regueiro: I have a Trilby which I sometimes wear in winter, but that's my only proper hat.
[30/10/2022, 23:36:20] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'll tell you how I find it, and you can tell me bluntly whether I should bother continuing. This is probably not the ideal way to receive career advice because there are lots of conflicts of interest.
[30/10/2022, 23:40:38] Alex Regueiro: I see. Theodicy sounds really interesting and fundamental, though I know so little about it. Maybe you can educate me at some point.
[30/10/2022, 23:41:23] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, you're probably right to doubt my impartiality, but I shall try to be impartial anyway!
[30/10/2022, 23:41:31] Alex Regueiro: Sounds like a good plan
[30/10/2022, 23:46:40] Alice Lafferty: There have been thousands of theodicies, all of them fail because it's an insoluble problem. I mean, I have my own idea but it's quite bleak and not fully fleshed out yet.
[30/10/2022, 23:47:17] Alice Lafferty: Thank you for answering all of my questions!
[30/10/2022, 23:47:32] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to listen to the rest of your playlist.
[30/10/2022, 23:48:29] Alex Regueiro: Well, I'd be curious to hear even your half-formed ideas at some point, if you want to share.
[30/10/2022, 23:48:31] Alex Regueiro: not at all
[30/10/2022, 23:49:05] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. Hope you enjoyed the Bach too, though I appreciate he can often take longer to fully appreciate.
[30/10/2022, 23:50:37] Alice Lafferty: I did. I liked the harpsichord.
[30/10/2022, 23:51:54] Alice Lafferty: You don't hear many of them anymoreüßê
[30/10/2022, 23:52:37] Alice Lafferty: If you are a pianist, would you be able to play one?
[30/10/2022, 23:54:32] Alex Regueiro: I'm glad! It's a divisive instrument, but I love it alongside the piano. It's made a mini comeback with the rise of "period performances", but there are still plenty of detracts even among professional musicians. Like Sir Thomas Beecham's famous attempt to ridicule it crassly.
[30/10/2022, 23:55:28] Alex Regueiro: To a degree yeah. The technique is a bit different though, as is the touch. At a professional level you definitely can't just swap one out for the other.
[30/10/2022, 23:56:15] Alice Lafferty: The sound of a harpsichord ‚Äì two skeletons copulating on a tin roof in a thunderstorm.
[30/10/2022, 23:56:19] Alice Lafferty: This?
[30/10/2022, 23:56:52] Alex Regueiro: yep
[30/10/2022, 23:57:48] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[30/10/2022, 23:58:09] Alice Lafferty: Have to beat the allegations as a Harpsichordophile.
[30/10/2022, 23:58:36] Alex Regueiro: I chuckled the first time too, but it's sort of sad, since it's so unfair. I think it can have a beautiful rich sound, even if it lacks dynamic variation or power in relation to the piano.
[30/10/2022, 23:58:51] Alex Regueiro: Bach himself loved the harpsichord best!
[31/10/2022, 00:00:29] Alice Lafferty: I'm going through Bach slowly and paying closest attention, because his name seems to crop up everywhere in non-musical fields... like it has talismanic power.
[31/10/2022, 00:02:36] Alex Regueiro: Great. That's the way. His music does need to be listened to actively and engaged with. It can be intellectual and mathematical like many say, but it's also full of supreme human emotion, which even his fans sometimes forget.
[31/10/2022, 00:03:18] Alex Regueiro: If you enjoy Godel Escher Bach, you may just have to convert to a mathematician. üòâ
[31/10/2022, 00:10:13] Alice Lafferty: Oh, this is what I was thinking of: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_cryptogram
[31/10/2022, 00:14:47] Alice Lafferty: I love stuff like this. This is why I did Theology, the Bible is like a huge cryptic crossword. I read at some point that a piece of music was used as a Diffie-Hellman public key exchange, but I'll have to get back to you on that.
[31/10/2022, 00:15:39] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, GEB mentions that. It's in the Art of the Fugue I know.
[31/10/2022, 00:16:03] Alex Regueiro: Oh, it's in that Brandenburg Concerto that I sent you too!
[31/10/2022, 00:16:07] Alex Regueiro: Didn't know that
[31/10/2022, 00:17:10] Alex Regueiro: Hah that's brilliant. I wasn't aware of the Diffie-Hellmann thing.
[31/10/2022, 00:18:23] Alex Regueiro: err the B-A-C-H theme I mean
[31/10/2022, 00:21:10] Alex Regueiro: Isaac Newton was apparently really interested in cryptical biblical hermeneutics. People considered it a bit occult. Do you know about that? Fascinating how the 'father' of modern physics had these interests.
[31/10/2022, 18:20:20] Alex Regueiro: Heyy. Sorry if I kept you up a bit last night.
[31/10/2022, 18:20:37] Alex Regueiro: Here's a good Halloween piece. Catholic-compatible even, I daresay. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM
[31/10/2022, 19:03:45] Alice Lafferty: I didn't know that either. Some type of Rosicrucianism?
[31/10/2022, 19:04:14] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry, you didn't.
[31/10/2022, 19:04:44] Alice Lafferty: Thank you, I do know this one!
[31/10/2022, 19:05:46] Alice Lafferty: Today I've been learning Python and also html. I made this crappy website via which you can access various playlists: https://allafferty.github.io
[31/10/2022, 19:07:35] Alice Lafferty: How was your day?
[31/10/2022, 19:09:00] Alice Lafferty: The playlist I made you is quite short and has relatively 'safe' songs...
[31/10/2022, 19:36:53] Alex Regueiro: Not sure. I always thought it was akin to numerology, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies#Newton's_interpretations_of_prophecy would explain it better than me
[31/10/2022, 19:37:13] Alex Regueiro: Thought you might! It's quite fun, in a macabre way
[31/10/2022, 19:37:35] Alex Regueiro: Thank you! I'll have a listen soon.
[31/10/2022, 19:42:13] Alex Regueiro: Hah that's great you have a Github account now. On your way towards being a developer. HTML and CSS can be quite fun, especially if you have a more artistic side.
[31/10/2022, 19:42:30] Alex Regueiro: It looks like you're getting to grips with it fairly quickly?
[31/10/2022, 19:43:20] Alex Regueiro: Fairly routine day. Catching up with the guy who runs the startup, and a friend.
[31/10/2022, 19:46:29] Alice Lafferty: HTML was fun and quite easy. Haven't done any CSS so obviously the website is very basic.
[31/10/2022, 19:47:19] Alice Lafferty: I won't talk to you about this anymore though because you're only going to make flattering comments.
[31/10/2022, 19:47:29] Alex Regueiro: Nah
[31/10/2022, 19:47:35] Alex Regueiro: I'm quite good at insults I'll have you know!
[31/10/2022, 19:48:21] Alex Regueiro: For the most part I'm exceedingly sparing with praise. In this case I'm trying to be encouraging more than flattering. üôÇ
[31/10/2022, 19:48:44] Alex Regueiro: How are you learning Python?
[31/10/2022, 19:57:36] Alex Regueiro: I recommend these in any case:
https://exercism.org/tracks/python (Very fitting for today! I used to use this a lot teaching people.)
https://projecteuler.net/archives (Fun mathematical style problems, if that appeals. Though wait until you've got down the basics.)
I also hear good things about https://brilliant.org/courses/programming-python/ and https://codefinity.com/funnel/quiz.
So, take your pick.
[31/10/2022, 20:05:34] Alice Lafferty: I did a free course on Udemy.
[31/10/2022, 20:05:44] Alice Lafferty: Thank you very much for all of these resources.
[31/10/2022, 20:08:34] Alex Regueiro: Gladly. And Udemy is usually good too, yeah.
[31/10/2022, 20:08:55] Alex Regueiro: By the way, do you like to be called Allie? I saw your Spotify.
[31/10/2022, 20:22:47] Alice Lafferty: Eh lots of people know me as Allie. I don't have a personal preference though.
[31/10/2022, 20:25:35] Alex Regueiro: Fair enough
[31/10/2022, 20:26:51] Alex Regueiro: Alice sounds slightly nicer to me, perhaps. Not sure.
[31/10/2022, 20:27:45] Alex Regueiro: Listening to your playlist now. I listened to The Herald last night. It‚Äôs very atmospheric and a little mystical. Reminds me a little of some of the King Crimson material. Drip Drip was really unique too. Song to Comus started well but the vocals got a bit annoying.
[31/10/2022, 20:28:36] Alice Lafferty: Yeah Allie is a bit like 'ally-cat'? Or something.
[31/10/2022, 20:29:20] Alice Lafferty: Lots of female vocalists really toe the line between 'ethereal' and screechy
[31/10/2022, 20:30:07] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, that came to mind. Not an association you'd want, I'd imagine. Not that it's bad otherwise.
[31/10/2022, 20:30:59] Alex Regueiro: That's a fair point. This is why I love Annie Haslam though, not even remotely screechy.
[31/10/2022, 20:50:05] Alice Lafferty: I was just looking through videos you favourited on Youtube and saw some pick-up artist style videos. It's kind of dehumanising to be on the receiving end of that stuff. So I'm no longer sure if I want to pursue a relationship with you. 

It was very nice talking to you anyhow & I wish you good luck in the future.
[31/10/2022, 20:50:15] Alex Regueiro: ¬©Ô∏èWhat??
[31/10/2022, 20:50:47] Alex Regueiro: That's so no me. What videos are you talking about?
[31/10/2022, 20:52:16] Alex Regueiro: I honestly haven't looked at that list in ages, but sometimes I accidentally put stuff in favourites instead of "watch later"
[31/10/2022, 20:53:30] Alex Regueiro: not*
[31/10/2022, 20:54:52] Alex Regueiro: And if it's on my Watch Later list, that's because it looked sufficiently controversial to be intriguing or linked me to it half the time.
[31/10/2022, 20:55:17] Alex Regueiro: üòî
[31/10/2022, 20:58:53] Alex Regueiro: I can only see one video that might look like that, which is a) just a really shitty click-bait cover for a Jordan Peterson academic lecture about the psychology of attraction (I have mixed views about him, but that's another conversation), b) it's definitely one that was meant to be on my "watch later" list, like some of the Feynman videos for that matter.
[31/10/2022, 21:00:06] Alex Regueiro: I'm so sorry you got that impression though. It honestly repels me too, and I swear I've never even watched one of those videos in my life. Or was it another video that bothered you?
[31/10/2022, 21:02:29] Alex Regueiro: And for the record, nor am I remotely some sort of nostalgic Soviet communist despite thinking their anthem and the video is pretty cool!
[31/10/2022, 21:11:23] Alice Lafferty: Sorry. I've been burnt before so now I spook like a horse when I see people interacting with, not even Jordan Peterson per se, but that general media ecosystem.
[31/10/2022, 21:12:44] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if I'd be able to tell if someone was using 'a line' on me.
[31/10/2022, 21:15:12] Alex Regueiro: I'm sorry (but sadly not surprised) to hear people have done that to you. Being anything other than authentic and genuine is something I find distasteful and even at a pragmatic level you're just fooling yourself and setting things up for failure later on.
[31/10/2022, 21:15:32] Alice Lafferty: You didn't do anything wrong obviously. You're perfectly entitled to watch whatever you like. I lack competency in relationships, EQ, stuff like that, and I've found it all very confusing and full of potential landmines.
[31/10/2022, 21:17:20] Alex Regueiro: I confess I find psychology interesting (in a totally amateur way), and hearing Peterson talk about the psychology of personality traits, politics, or attraction is just thought-provoking. I agree with much of it but not all, for the record. He's often too black-and-white for my taste.
[31/10/2022, 21:19:16] Alice Lafferty: It wasn't anything serious. I was talking to a man for a while and later found out some of his messages were copy-pasted from certain terrifying 'seduction manuals'. It was kind of funny at first but it became less so when I found out about the ideological structures behind it.
[31/10/2022, 21:19:36] Alice Lafferty: Me too. My personal gripe with him is that he misrepresents Christianity.
[31/10/2022, 21:22:42] Alex Regueiro: It is so so full of landmines. Let me be honest with you: relationships and dating has never come naturally to me either. What ability I've gained has been through trial and error over years and just generally maturing as a person. I've obviously seen a few slimy ads for these pick-up artist types, and heard others talk about them (disparagingly), so I was never even inclined to look into it.
[31/10/2022, 21:23:27] Alex Regueiro: I wouldn't know so much about that, but I'd be curious to hear. Whenever he brings up Christianity in his videos it does seem like he's putting his own slant/agenda on it a little though.
[31/10/2022, 21:24:04] Alex Regueiro: Ew. Was this recent? Hopefully not a Cambridge guy. One would expect better!
[31/10/2022, 21:28:38] Alice Lafferty: It's just such a jumble. He tries to reconcile fit Christian figures into Jungian archetypes then sprinkles in a bit of occidentalised Taoism...
[31/10/2022, 21:28:55] Alice Lafferty: *fit? Not sure why I wrote that
[31/10/2022, 21:29:18] Alice Lafferty: No it was some guy from a dating app
[31/10/2022, 21:29:50] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, his obsession with Jung... I've still not looked into Jung properly, so never quite understood that. Shoehorned eh?
[31/10/2022, 21:29:55] Alice Lafferty: I think you're doing well. You have a decade+ experience on me.
[31/10/2022, 21:30:58] Alex Regueiro: I naturally veer away from anything that smacks of mysticism. So, something like gnosticism would be the least attractive of all 'Christian' sects.
[31/10/2022, 21:31:59] Alex Regueiro: Thanks. üôÇ My experience doesn't necessarily match my years, since I went a good few years convinced I didn't ever want a relationship, but that's long in the past.
[31/10/2022, 21:32:14] Alex Regueiro: And you have plenty of time!
[31/10/2022, 21:32:55] Alice Lafferty: Jung was a faker and probably a CIA asset, to begin with. On a very fundamental level Jungianism and Taoism are dualistic whereas Christianity is Trinitarian and derivative. It doesn't work well.
[31/10/2022, 21:34:12] Alice Lafferty: I mean, each aspect of the Trinity 'derives' from the other, there's a kind of gradation, as opposed to a metaphysic of two equal contrasting.
[31/10/2022, 21:34:54] Alice Lafferty: Gnostics are very fun! Gnosticism is also the domininant mode in which relate to our bodies in the 21st century.
[31/10/2022, 21:34:54] Alex Regueiro: (By the way, if there's anything a little personal you want to ask me, feel free. I'll be candid. It made me a bit queasy that you thought that of me, though I don't blame you one bit, given your experience.)
[31/10/2022, 21:35:09] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, fun! But not something I could get behind personally
[31/10/2022, 21:35:23] Alex Regueiro: Just an intellectual interest
[31/10/2022, 21:36:11] Alex Regueiro: I think I know what you mean. The sort of ultra-dualistic take on the mind/body problem?
[31/10/2022, 21:37:07] Alice Lafferty: Me too. I used to insist I didn't want a relationship, but I don't know if that was just a design to conceal my private fear I would be unsuccessful in one.
[31/10/2022, 21:37:37] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I kind of jumped to conclusions.
[31/10/2022, 21:37:45] Alex Regueiro: Yikes. Didn't know that. Do you like Freud? He always bothered me in some way, though a few of his ideas are interesting. Adler I know almost nothing about, but should really look into at some point. I have great respect for Fraenkel though, if you know him. In the Viennese tradition, but a heretic kicked out of Adler's circle when he was young.
[31/10/2022, 21:38:13] Alex Regueiro: No worries. It's all fine now. Thanks for understanding me.
[31/10/2022, 21:39:13] Alex Regueiro: Anyway I doubt the rest of that playlist was too surprising. I think you already knew I was culturally on the conservative side, at least by 21st C standards! Despite being agnostic. Economically more nuanced, perhaps.
[31/10/2022, 21:39:30] Alice Lafferty: All forms of psychology should be treated with utmost skepticism imo.
[31/10/2022, 21:39:41] Alice Lafferty: Haven't heard of Fraenkel?
[31/10/2022, 21:40:36] Alice Lafferty: Yes, that there is a little ghostly 'self' piloting a sort of flesh suit.
[31/10/2022, 21:41:03] Alex Regueiro: That was a big part of the story for me too. The other part was that my intellectual interests tended to dominate. And as an introvert, I usually just needed a few friends to satisfy my emotional needs. So I thought.
[31/10/2022, 21:41:43] Alex Regueiro: They should. So much of it is borderline pseudo-science. Most of Freud's stuff certainly was, as I see it.
[31/10/2022, 21:43:07] Alice Lafferty: I think his theories have artistic or literary merit but no more... With him I always think of that quote: 'it's not correct but it's well-conceived'.
[31/10/2022, 21:43:23] Alice Lafferty: But I don't trust any science softer than chemistry.
[31/10/2022, 21:43:48] Alex Regueiro: Look up Man's Search for Meaning. He was a survivor of Auschwitz/Birkenau. Such an interesting personal story, but he more or less takes off his Jew's hat and puts on his psychologist's hat in that book (sorry!).
[31/10/2022, 21:44:54] Alex Regueiro: His writing really resonated with me. Like other psychology a lot may be hypothetical, but at a "philosophy of life" level, I'm okay with that. Anyway, thoroughly recommended.
[31/10/2022, 21:46:09] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, the footing gets really wobbly the more applied/soft you go. Experimental verification and falsification becomes much less clear-cut.
[31/10/2022, 21:46:22] Alice Lafferty: Exactly, most psychology is much more like a folk philosophy, 'wisdom' etc. And I can appreciate it when it describes itself as such
[31/10/2022, 21:46:48] Alice Lafferty: I will look, thanks.
[31/10/2022, 21:48:11] Alex Regueiro: And the "web" of knowledge/belief gets harder to disentangle but you're so high-level.
[31/10/2022, 21:48:34] Alex Regueiro: Yep, it just seems more intellectually honest.
[31/10/2022, 21:48:49] Alex Regueiro: cf. Quine
[31/10/2022, 21:49:01] Alice Lafferty: Same, but to a degree it affects my life quite badly. I didn't go back to university this term largely because I had found it exhausting being around so many people all the time. I don't know how that will play out in a relationship.
[31/10/2022, 21:49:27] Alice Lafferty: ?
[31/10/2022, 21:49:57] Alex Regueiro: Quine, the American pragmatist philosopher. He wrote about this sort of stuff. Very influential on my own views. (Two Dogmas of Empiricism is a wonderful paper.)
[31/10/2022, 21:50:40] Alice Lafferty: ...adding to my 'to read' list‚úÖ
[31/10/2022, 21:52:14] Alex Regueiro: That's a very reasonable concern. Some introverts do best with (slight) extroverts perhaps, but I'd imagine you need someone who gives you plenty of space to yourself and isn't too outgoing or too clingy. Perhaps I'm just projecting my own preferences though!
[31/10/2022, 21:53:39] Alice Lafferty: No that's completely right
[31/10/2022, 21:57:43] Alice Lafferty: I don't know what your relationship history is like but I don't really have one. I'm also not totally sure what your intentions are on dating apps or more generally? In the future you can just be blunt if you don't want to see me anymore.
[31/10/2022, 21:58:06] Alice Lafferty: Or whatever. It would avoid miscommunication.
[31/10/2022, 22:02:13] Alex Regueiro: It's very thin... Basically through a combination of lack of interest in a relationship, my own eccentricities and obtuseness (I used to struggle even recognising when a woman is interested), and setting very high standards (at least for a guy). I've been on a fair few dates, but I feel so out of touch with contemporary dating culture. Like I belong to another time period. Even the ones that go well I'm rarely interested enough to pursue it further.
[31/10/2022, 22:02:54] Alice Lafferty: Kind of similar to me.
[31/10/2022, 22:03:13] Alice Lafferty: Re 'high standards', I was worried my physical appearance would be a barrier.
[31/10/2022, 22:03:33] Alice Lafferty: As I think it has been in the past.
[31/10/2022, 22:03:59] Alex Regueiro: My last relationship of sorts was long distance and several years ago. Lockdown didn't help, but I went through a second phase where I thought my life just wouldn't involve a relationship and I became comfortable with that idea.
[31/10/2022, 22:06:06] Alex Regueiro: Dating apps... my intention used to be to simply avoid them, but now it's to find something long term where I can connect at a deep level, ideally. I've never had a one-night stand (though there's a story or two on that subject) and certainly not looking for one now. That really limits your possibilities these days though, especially at your age, but even at mine!
[31/10/2022, 22:06:31] Alex Regueiro: As in, you thought people would consider you out of their league?
[31/10/2022, 22:07:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes! I put lots of conservative social signals on my profile to try and ward off people looking for casual sex.
[31/10/2022, 22:07:15] Alice Lafferty: Not interested.
[31/10/2022, 22:08:09] Alex Regueiro: You succeeded! Men don't have to worry about that so much, but I was certainly clear. In fact I quite intentionally warded off most "normal" types with my profile. üôÇ
[31/10/2022, 22:08:51] Alex Regueiro: Normal, as in, mundane and dull, standard interests, etc.
[31/10/2022, 22:10:10] Alice Lafferty: No, the opposite! Being moderately physically unattractive, with men primarily selecting partners on the basis of appearance... is difficult
[31/10/2022, 22:11:44] Alex Regueiro: Alice, that is not the case. Unless I'm even weirder than I thought. At the risk of flattering you, I'm confident most guys would say you're pretty attractive.
[31/10/2022, 22:12:05] Alice Lafferty: You would think the questionnaires on OKC would be able to put you in touch with people who had overlapping answers...
[31/10/2022, 22:12:08] Alex Regueiro: Are you putting yourself up against supermodels? That would hardly be fair
[31/10/2022, 22:12:28] Alice Lafferty: Pft
[31/10/2022, 22:12:35] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I'm not angling for compliments
[31/10/2022, 22:12:37] Alex Regueiro: I know. It's a bit hit and miss. Used to be better. I tried this site briefly many years ago (and some friends had success on it).
[31/10/2022, 22:12:58] Alex Regueiro: And I wasn't trying to give one per se, it's just I think you're somewhat mistaken.
[31/10/2022, 22:13:30] Alex Regueiro: Other apps/sites are even worse! I've tried a few, and they tend to encourage even more shallowness.
[31/10/2022, 22:13:39] Alice Lafferty: Well, since people have more access to more images of beautiful women, I am in a manner of speaking.
[31/10/2022, 22:14:17] Alex Regueiro: That's a fair point in that with the Internet, modern celebrity culture, perhaps porn, standards are a bit crazy now.
[31/10/2022, 22:14:56] Alice Lafferty: Yes. To be fair it's the best of a bad bunch.
[31/10/2022, 22:15:52] Alex Regueiro: I'd also say 21st century Western women on the whole tend to judge men more by looks than they used to, or indeed women in other cultures do. I also think the question of objectivity/subjectivity of attractiveness and the ethnocultural side to that is very interesting, both at an intellectual and personal levle.
[31/10/2022, 22:16:01] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[31/10/2022, 22:16:23] Alice Lafferty: I've had to infer this from the fact that my experience with men is so different from other women's, who seem to be constantly fielding romantic advances :s
[31/10/2022, 22:16:50] Alice Lafferty: I was quite upset about this in my teens but I'd kind of gotten over it. I don't know why I'm excavating all of this stuff now.
[31/10/2022, 22:18:03] Alice Lafferty: As far as I can tell men seem to be concerned about two physical features: balding (you are fine there) and height (you are more than fine there).
[31/10/2022, 22:18:32] Alice Lafferty: Maybe musculature as well?
[31/10/2022, 22:18:35] Alice Lafferty: Not sure
[31/10/2022, 22:19:19] Alex Regueiro: I can't say it with any certainty, but I think it's more likely your personality and interests (which I personally find engaging) may well put off your average guy. But I don't think you would or should want it any other way. Even if the guy is attractive, it would be a recipe for failure
[31/10/2022, 22:20:32] Alice Lafferty: Maybe yes
[31/10/2022, 22:21:48] Alice Lafferty: I'm afraid that it is largely objective and immutable barring cosmetic surgery, and the subjective element accounts for maybe 20% at most.
[31/10/2022, 22:22:21] Alice Lafferty: I guess I'm jealous that the way in which men can be socially valued is so multi-dimensional in comparison!
[31/10/2022, 22:22:23] Alex Regueiro: Nice of you to say. You're essentially right. About musculature too, though the importance of that varies hugely in the eyes of woman, and in any case I'd like to think I'm okay, since I'm in decent shape and semi-strong these days (never had the issue of being fat). It's one of those things it took me a while to realise people, especially women, care about it.
[31/10/2022, 22:23:44] Alex Regueiro: You have a point. We have other issues, trust me, but the biological tendency is certainly for male attractiveness to be less important a factor in the eyes of women than vice versa!
[31/10/2022, 22:24:16] Alice Lafferty: I don't personally have a strong preference. But I find the heavily veined bodybuilder type positively unattractive though.
[31/10/2022, 22:24:43] Alex Regueiro: Equally, an attractive woman can afford to be 100% passive in the "dating market" and still get lots of opportunities. Anything but a super-attractive man cannot, full stop.
[31/10/2022, 22:24:52] Alice Lafferty: Yup.
[31/10/2022, 22:24:53] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I actually think most women do.
[31/10/2022, 22:25:14] Alice Lafferty: True I think.
[31/10/2022, 22:25:52] Alex Regueiro: If you're anywhere from the light of average to slightly muscly, I think you're probably in a good place as a guy.
[31/10/2022, 22:26:08] Alice Lafferty: It's a shame to think about human relationships as items on a marketplace.
[31/10/2022, 22:26:46] Alex Regueiro: I more or less agree, but I was thinking at an inter-cultural/ethnic level. I've looked a little at the literature here, and apparently the preferences (even in terms of looks, and leaving aside other traits) vary a fair bit between countries and ethnic groups.
[31/10/2022, 22:27:26] Alex Regueiro: Very much. But we live in an era where even dating has been commodified to a high degree. Apps are quite indicative of that. I'm kind of with the Marxists on this point!
[31/10/2022, 22:27:40] Alice Lafferty: Increasingly I'm finding that most sociopolitcal issues I struggle with reduce down to the tension between two points: 1) that a world governed by evolutionary psychology is a desperately bleak world to live in, and 2) it seems likely to be true.
[31/10/2022, 22:27:44] Alex Regueiro: cf. Bauman
[31/10/2022, 22:28:38] Alice Lafferty: And I say this as a kind of indictment against reality.
[31/10/2022, 22:29:34] Alice Lafferty: Really, I'd read the opposite, that preferences largely hold cross-culturally, hence the biological origin.
[31/10/2022, 22:30:46] Alex Regueiro: A personal observation, for example ‚Äì and this is neither an attempt to be self-deprecating or vain ‚Äì I am evidently not very attractive in the eyes of most British girls, whereas women of certain other ethnicities (e.g., southern European, especially Italian, Jewish, and East Asian) tend to find me decently attractive. Big generalisation, of course, but I think at a statistical level it's pretty valid.
[31/10/2022, 22:31:46] Alice Lafferty: Haha really? I haven't noticed any effect like that.
[31/10/2022, 22:32:16] Alice Lafferty: Isn't that just preference for ones own race? Maybe British women don't read you as 'caucasian'.
[31/10/2022, 22:32:33] Alex Regueiro: Evolutionary psychology is funnily enough what a lot of progressives rail against these days, even though a spirit of scientism (in the worst sense) tends to pervade their philosophy. There's certainly nothing transcendent to them, and I think that's a major problem. I've grappled with it too.
[31/10/2022, 22:32:58] Alex Regueiro: I've read the same, and it's true to a large extent but not as much as is often portrayed.
[31/10/2022, 22:33:52] Alex Regueiro: To a large extent yes. There's this quality called "averageness" (nothing to do with average looks), which means that we find attractive those with phenotypes that are well-represented in our society/environment.
[31/10/2022, 22:35:08] Alex Regueiro: The preference for masculine vs. feminine features in men also varies a decent amount. Curiously, women in most countries tend to like men with *slightly* feminised appearances, though not too much. Very few countries have preferences for men with hyper-masculinised appearances.
[31/10/2022, 22:35:10] Alice Lafferty: I know... it's so strange. And then on the other hand you have those on the right often mixing vaguely Christian mysticism with the most cynical brand of evo psych (thinking of Peterson again).
[31/10/2022, 22:36:05] Alice Lafferty: I can believe that. I wonder where the body builder ideal arose from them.
[31/10/2022, 22:36:18] Alex Regueiro: Hard to know how much of this is nature vs nurture. But if you look at e.g. Japanese or Korean men, I think anyone can realise that not only do they skew towards the "feminine" end, but that Japanese and Korean women tend to like that too.
[31/10/2022, 22:36:21] Alice Lafferty: That kind of body is not even superior functionally.
[31/10/2022, 22:36:45] Alex Regueiro: It's true. And there are some who do it worse than him too!
[31/10/2022, 22:36:53] Alice Lafferty: Muscles of body builders are weaker pound for pound (apparently)
[31/10/2022, 22:37:44] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, I'd read that in a global dating market, Asian men fare worst.
[31/10/2022, 22:37:48] Alex Regueiro: It's quite odd. But I'm convinced that your average woman likes a moderately muscly man and nothing more. A few women like the body builder type, and a few even like slightly chubby men.
[31/10/2022, 22:38:00] Alice Lafferty: But again, everyone does better within their own ethnicity as you said.
[31/10/2022, 22:38:00] Alex Regueiro: That's what I've read too.
[31/10/2022, 22:38:07] Alex Regueiro: White men the best, according to most studies
[31/10/2022, 22:38:20] Alex Regueiro: Whereas Asian women come out top (followed by White) and Black women bottom.
[31/10/2022, 22:38:26] Alice Lafferty: Is that affluence or something else?
[31/10/2022, 22:38:50] Alex Regueiro: I can believe it. When resources are scarce, it's probably a terribly maladaptive body type. Think Neanderthals. They didn't fair so well eh?
[31/10/2022, 22:39:15] Alex Regueiro: Is what?
[31/10/2022, 22:39:41] Alice Lafferty: Agree. And there is overall more lenience because it's less important.
[31/10/2022, 22:39:50] Alex Regueiro: yeah
[31/10/2022, 22:39:51] Alice Lafferty: Female preference for white men
[31/10/2022, 22:39:57] Alice Lafferty: I mean 'status'
[31/10/2022, 22:40:24] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps more important in the post-Sexual-Revolution West compared to most other societies, but I wouldn't want to overstate that too much.
[31/10/2022, 22:40:39] Alex Regueiro: (Are you familiar with the work of Louise Perry, by any chance?)
[31/10/2022, 22:40:43] Alice Lafferty: It's enough to make me want to retreat forever.
[31/10/2022, 22:41:35] Alice Lafferty: I've seen her book mentioned in right-wing circles I look in on sometimes, but have not read her.
[31/10/2022, 22:42:12] Alex Regueiro: I don't know, I just saw the charts mainly. I suspect that does play a role, as well as Anglo-American cultural hegemony, but I also suspect (I'd get crucified for this on social media) that White men strike on the whole strike a balance between masculinity and femininity in appearance. The study was designed to only test looks, as I recall.
[31/10/2022, 22:42:42] Alex Regueiro: Interestingly, the masculine-feminine "happy medium" doesn't apply to women, apparently. The more feminine, the more attractive, they say.
[31/10/2022, 22:43:34] Alice Lafferty: Could be yes
[31/10/2022, 22:45:22] Alice Lafferty: üò¨
[31/10/2022, 22:46:24] Alex Regueiro: I've seen her videos a little, heard others talk about her, and read excerpts. Basically she's a traditional feminist on most counts. Certainly started off that way, and is still a strong advocate for female choice and agency in society, even if doesn't blame the patriarchy as much as most traditional feminists. But basically she thinks the Sexual Revolution was terrible for the great majority women, and to a lesser extent men (except obviously the playboy types). She's not even particularly conservative, I'd say, but she certainly appeals to those with conservative views on culture and sexuality.
[31/10/2022, 22:46:32] Alex Regueiro: Haha why?
[31/10/2022, 22:47:52] Alice Lafferty: Ok, that's roughly the impression I got.
[31/10/2022, 22:48:56] Alex Regueiro: She lambastes the concept of "meaningless sex" though, arguing the vast majority of us simply aren't capable of it by nature. I think she has a strong point, even if I don't agree with her on everything else. She's also sharply critical of dating apps.
[31/10/2022, 22:49:00] Alice Lafferty: I find it difficult to make value judgements about this kind of thing because as far as I can tell I differ substantially from an average woman both psychologically and in terms of sexual desirability.
[31/10/2022, 22:49:22] Alice Lafferty: So, would most women have been happier pre-sexual revolution? Maybe?
[31/10/2022, 22:49:55] Alice Lafferty: I think most men are capable of meaningless sex. Don't mean that in an accusatory way.
[31/10/2022, 22:51:51] Alex Regueiro: Probably more capable than women, but I think even for men it's hard to sustain it and keep feelings from getting involved or bonding from happening
[31/10/2022, 22:52:00] Alex Regueiro: She certainly makes that point
[31/10/2022, 22:52:19] Alex Regueiro: And even now, and even for hyper-attractive women, she argues that the situation is only short-term desirable for them
[31/10/2022, 22:53:14] Alex Regueiro: Feel free to ignore it, but here's a nice video discussing her book. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToR7bA0QiPI
[31/10/2022, 22:53:17] Alex Regueiro: short-ish
[31/10/2022, 22:53:23] Alice Lafferty: As a sort of onlooker, it seems true that monogamous societies are more stable and prosperous than polygynous ones. Unconstrained by strong monagmous social norms, humans are polygynous, just like all primates.
[31/10/2022, 22:53:42] Alice Lafferty: But I don't know whether the experience of the individual is better?
[31/10/2022, 22:54:06] Alex Regueiro: Without constraints, they're serially monogamous in fact. (I had this debate not so long ago in fact.)
[31/10/2022, 22:54:21] Alice Lafferty: Is sex inside marriage necessarily better or more 'meaningful'? Wasn't the old phrase: 'lie back and think of England'?
[31/10/2022, 22:54:32] Alex Regueiro: Lifelong monogamy is definitely a sociocultural phenomenon though. Just an incredibly successful one from a social perspective.
[31/10/2022, 22:54:40] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes
[31/10/2022, 22:54:47] Alex Regueiro: I can't answer that really. Maybe? Maybe not.
[31/10/2022, 22:54:59] Alex Regueiro: societal perspective*
[31/10/2022, 22:55:12] Alice Lafferty: Thanks I will watch later
[31/10/2022, 22:55:58] Alice Lafferty: Wasn't that just a euphemism for marital rape?
[31/10/2022, 22:56:23] Alex Regueiro: The science is quite clear on this. Chimps are full-on polygamous though, especially the females, and it makes for a super violent society. Humans are sufficiently different that it wouldn't ever be a stable system for us, I've seen it argued.
[31/10/2022, 22:56:35] Alice Lafferty: Hm, where did you read this?
[31/10/2022, 22:56:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha you beat me to it
[31/10/2022, 22:56:54] Alex Regueiro: It sounds like it could well have been. At very least submission to the man, to put it kindly.
[31/10/2022, 22:57:18] Alex Regueiro: I was just commenting on whether it's more "meaningful" in marriage (in some sense). That's an open question to me. But I do think it's clearly more socially stable.
[31/10/2022, 22:57:41] Alex Regueiro: Several places. I believe it's a consensus among anthropologists and primatologists now.
[31/10/2022, 22:58:02] Alice Lafferty: I don't see how either of those social models really solve problems for the living particular man of woman. Status is a zero-sum game.
[31/10/2022, 22:58:10] Alice Lafferty: *or
[31/10/2022, 22:58:24] Alice Lafferty: And it sucks to be at the bottom of the pile either way.
[31/10/2022, 22:58:29] Alex Regueiro: Wait, here's another really good video. Comparing humans and other apes in behaviour, psychology, social dynamics. By a leading academic. https://youtu.be/BAifu7lu8TU
[31/10/2022, 22:58:40] Alice Lafferty: Macroscopically monogamy seems more desirable?
[31/10/2022, 22:59:02] Alice Lafferty: Huh, I'm reading out of date stuff maybe.
[31/10/2022, 23:00:58] Alex Regueiro: It is, at a societal level. I'm not sure it's so much about status, as marriage is highly beneficial in increasing survival and flourishing of the man and woman. Division of labour, guaranteed mutual support and childrearing, and other things. I think it was virtually essential until mid-20th C Western societies. The fact it no longer may well be a good thing, but it's certainly thrown our society into turmoil and created all sorts of unintended consequences which need to be carefully studied.
[31/10/2022, 23:01:12] Alice Lafferty: I thought that line of thinking comes from the fact that we have twice as many female ancestors as male.
[31/10/2022, 23:02:44] Alex Regueiro: That's sort of my main gripe with the idea of the patriarchy. It's just not an accurate/useful description of the arrangement between men and women for the most part. It's a truism that men are on average much more physically powerful and aggressive and can use that to dominated women. But for most people in most of history it's been more like a mutually beneficial albeit imbalanced relationship between your average man and woman. Do you know what I mean? I find it hard to explain this here though, even typing on my laptop. Another time maybe. üôÇ
[31/10/2022, 23:03:48] Alex Regueiro: Ah. Is there genetic evidence for that? Sounds plausible, though it would only argue against lifelong monogamy as the norm, it wouldn't make serial monogamy any less likely than polygamy.
[31/10/2022, 23:04:14] Alice Lafferty: I find this convincing, but, again, only for men and women who are psychologically close to average for their respective sex. Which to be fair is the majority.
[31/10/2022, 23:05:20] Alice Lafferty: No, I'm familiar with this argument, it's complementarianism.
[31/10/2022, 23:05:58] Alex Regueiro: I'm with you there
[31/10/2022, 23:06:03] Alice Lafferty: https://psmag.com/.amp/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success
[31/10/2022, 23:06:11] Alice Lafferty: This gives an even steeper ratio.
[31/10/2022, 23:06:44] Alice Lafferty: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22743131/
[31/10/2022, 23:07:02] Alex Regueiro: Outliers can still exist in society. I mean, it's often been the norm for high-status men to practice polygyny. And that is somewhat stable. But when too many men do it, you naturally get big societal problems.
[31/10/2022, 23:08:27] Alice Lafferty: This is limited to 18th century Britain so hardly representative, but apparently up to 10% of women never married. Fulfilled 'spinster' type roles/entered religious orders.
[31/10/2022, 23:09:21] Alex Regueiro: While that number is surely debated, it's believable in the sense that a small number of highly successful men had lots of children and descendants, with lots of women. You've probably heard that 1/4 of central Asian men descend from some guy who lived about 800 years ago, right? In the paternal line no less! This one Genghis Khan and his dozens/hundreds of wives and concubines changed the course of genetic history, due to the social dynamics of status and mating. Not everyone agrees, but it's a credible argument even among academics.
[31/10/2022, 23:09:47] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's quite believable. The number of men would be even higher. Always has been.
[31/10/2022, 23:09:51] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly, polygyny.
[31/10/2022, 23:11:07] Alice Lafferty: I don't think it's because of that. Plus sex selective infanticide and abortion were practised much later than we care to remember. I think instead this can happen if a woman is too disagreeable/eccentric or simply too physically unattractive.
[31/10/2022, 23:11:30] Alice Lafferty: Or at least falls into ~10th percentile, something like that.
[31/10/2022, 23:12:17] Alice Lafferty: Genghis Khan's access to his concubines would have been exclusive.
[31/10/2022, 23:12:28] Alice Lafferty: Hence, preventing other males from mating.
[31/10/2022, 23:12:57] Alex Regueiro: It certainly can do. But we know that throughout history, the women who did reproduce were monopolised by a smaller number of men. How small that cohort of men was varies depend on all sorts of sociocultural factors, but the most important was perhaps the existence of a strictly monogamous religion like Christianity. Which of course plenty of men and women (across the class spectrum) violated, albeit at their own peril.
[31/10/2022, 23:13:30] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. But like you were saying, it's a zero-sum game. One man who mates with a lot of women tends to mean a lot of other men don't get to mate.
[31/10/2022, 23:14:51] Alex Regueiro: That's fine (society can exist stably) if it's just a very few men like that. But if the effects get out of hand, and you have lots of "incels", you get a lot of frustrated violent men who cause chaos in society. And that's a disaster for everyone. Lots of societies have grappled with that in the past and probably present. (I've seen the case made this was a major trigger for the Viking age!)
[31/10/2022, 23:15:36] Alex Regueiro: These are just interesting ideas I've read. Don't ask me to back them up with hard evidence haha
[31/10/2022, 23:16:16] Alice Lafferty: Yes. And women are corralled to act as violence sponges.
[31/10/2022, 23:16:32] Alex Regueiro: Saldy, yes.
[31/10/2022, 23:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Sadly*
[31/10/2022, 23:17:18] Alex Regueiro: But in the end almost everyone suffers in such circumstances, I believe. That's basically the reason for monogamous societies/religions flourishing, I'd say.
[31/10/2022, 23:17:54] Alice Lafferty: Same
[31/10/2022, 23:18:29] Alex Regueiro: The phenomenon of monks, nuns, and hermits must have helped that situation too. Christianity really is a great exercise in social control/engineering in several ways! I wouldn't dare claim that's all there is to it, like some cynical atheists do, but I don't deny it.
[31/10/2022, 23:18:30] Alice Lafferty: I think evo psych should be treated as an infohazard.
[31/10/2022, 23:19:06] Alex Regueiro: Haha that's probably a very apt term
[31/10/2022, 23:19:36] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure if my ability to form uncynical social or romantic bonds will survive intact.
[31/10/2022, 23:19:45] Alex Regueiro: When it evo psych tackles question about race, maybe even more so?
[31/10/2022, 23:20:14] Alex Regueiro: against the onslaught of evo psych?
[31/10/2022, 23:21:03] Alice Lafferty: The subtle difference is that  effective societies were not engineered consciously. It's just like when people ascribe intention to evolution. It's not deliberate, it's simply that what works, survives.
[31/10/2022, 23:22:11] Alice Lafferty: Uh oh... danger zone danger zone
[31/10/2022, 23:22:21] Alex Regueiro: Engineering was probably the wrong word. Even the Catholic Church wasn't always engaging in conscious social evolution. It was more of an organic transformation. But yeah, the best societies and traditions often arise out of a sort of natural selection over history, I'd argue.
[31/10/2022, 23:23:44] Alice Lafferty: Maybe everyone is always making cost-benefit analyses re other people, on some level of consciousness. All eco psych does is encourage you to make those calculations explicit.
[31/10/2022, 23:24:18] Alex Regueiro: Sir, you need to drop the regression analysis and slowly back away!
[31/10/2022, 23:24:28] Alice Lafferty: *on some level of consciousness, maybe even the central nervous system.
[31/10/2022, 23:25:50] Alex Regueiro: That's probably fair, though I think the vast majority is subconscious/subliminal. And I'm not sure that's a big problem. It's just part of our nature, an unavoidable part.
[31/10/2022, 23:27:17] Alice Lafferty: I guess also the knowledge that people are essentially aspirational, and my partner will 'trade up' as soon as he gets the opportunity. And - it would be rational for him to do so, which is the final kick in the teeth.
[31/10/2022, 23:27:20] Alex Regueiro: You might have been there when Noah Carl got fired from Cambridge and thoroughly cancelled. What a palaver. I'm personally doubtful of the utility of such research. Mixed views at best. Though that was an ugly backlash.
[31/10/2022, 23:28:56] Alice Lafferty: I think that was a bit before my time..?
[31/10/2022, 23:29:51] Alice Lafferty: Strangely enough, becoming aware of racial IQ differences did not actually make me a racist.
[31/10/2022, 23:30:04] Alice Lafferty: I still basically just take each person as an individual.
[31/10/2022, 23:30:06] Alex Regueiro: To some extent that's true, though you may be underestimating male monogamous tendencies, at least for a large proportion. There are the (now old) statistics that women usually get bored in marriages first, initiate divorces, etc. I think especially as men age, they want emotional security and stable, and having a loyal wife who he's equally loyal to is the best way towards that. The "sow your wild oats" stage is long over by then.
[31/10/2022, 23:30:56] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. The evidence still isn't totally clear, but what I say to myself is that even if they do exist (it's quite plausible), the variation within races still dwarfs it, hence best to judge everyone as an individual!
[31/10/2022, 23:31:13] Alice Lafferty: It does make Affropessimism seem reasonable though.
[31/10/2022, 23:31:15] Alex Regueiro: Same goes for male/female differences, though IQ probably isn't one.
[31/10/2022, 23:31:22] Alice Lafferty: *afro
[31/10/2022, 23:31:41] Alex Regueiro: (I've seen it argued in academia that men are more represented at both tails of the IQ bell curve, which is also believable, but that the mean is identical.)
[31/10/2022, 23:31:56] Alice Lafferty: Right, this stuff is interesting at population level but nearly irrelevant at personal.
[31/10/2022, 23:32:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes, male variability hypothesis.
[31/10/2022, 23:32:22] Alex Regueiro: It does. I think it's a combination of factors though, many of which are historical, environmental/climatological, and political. But it could certainly be one.
[31/10/2022, 23:32:39] Alex Regueiro: Right. I've no firm opinion on it except that it's very plausible.
[31/10/2022, 23:33:22] Alice Lafferty: I was pretty disappointed to learn about that.
[31/10/2022, 23:34:27] Alex Regueiro: Only natural. Though I think the difference in variability is still inferred to be rather small? Geniuses are incredibly rare even among men. A slightly lower prevalence of female geniuses (if even true) is hardly damning. üôÇ
[31/10/2022, 23:34:38] Alice Lafferty: But obviously my own intelligence was not changed by learning, so if if was sufficient before, it's still sufficient now.
[31/10/2022, 23:34:53] Alice Lafferty: *learning about the distribution
[31/10/2022, 23:35:21] Alex Regueiro: Right. It's an informational/probabilistic fallacy to judge yourself or anyone you know well on that basis, since you have much better "priors" (Bayesian sense)
[31/10/2022, 23:35:32] Alex Regueiro: yes!
[31/10/2022, 23:35:42] Alice Lafferty: Yes.
[31/10/2022, 23:36:17] Alice Lafferty: It does clarify why males make up the majority of both the intellectual elite and the prison population.
[31/10/2022, 23:36:22] Alex Regueiro: By the way, I finished your playlist. Really enjoyable, thank you. I'm so happy to discover new prog/rock stuff, or classical for that matter.
[31/10/2022, 23:36:39] Alex Regueiro: Truth is I slightly dislike Stravinsky on the whole, but that was one of his nicer pieces
[31/10/2022, 23:37:23] Alex Regueiro: And the Carl Stone one maybe isn't 100% my thing, but I could definitely listen to it in the background still.
[31/10/2022, 23:37:32] Alex Regueiro: All the rest were lovely
[31/10/2022, 23:38:03] Alex Regueiro: Heaven is one I have in my collection, and I was familiar with Phaedra too, but that's it
[31/10/2022, 23:38:26] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I couldn't remember whether you mentioned him in a positive or negative light...
[31/10/2022, 23:38:40] Alice Lafferty: Completely understandable.
[31/10/2022, 23:39:22] Alex Regueiro: Most definitely. One of the things Peterson said is that on average men are only slightly more aggressive than women (I'm actually sceptical, "moderately" seems fairer), but it still means they make up 99% of hyper-aggressive people and thus violent criminals.
[31/10/2022, 23:39:38] Alex Regueiro: The normal distribution strikes again
[31/10/2022, 23:39:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes I love that song.
[31/10/2022, 23:40:24] Alex Regueiro: It's one of my favs too. Talking Heads is great all-round though.
[31/10/2022, 23:41:12] Alice Lafferty: There are serious social penalties incurred for being on the tail end of any bell curve.
[31/10/2022, 23:41:13] Alex Regueiro: Even composers I'm not a big fan of like Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and Debussy, have the odd great piece.
[31/10/2022, 23:41:21] Alice Lafferty: On any metric.
[31/10/2022, 23:41:35] Alex Regueiro: Hello! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[31/10/2022, 23:41:38] Alice Lafferty: Which is funny because almost all people have at least one uncommon trait.
[31/10/2022, 23:42:05] Alex Regueiro: I'm on the tail end of a few distributions. Some of them in an advantageous way, at least, but not all...
[31/10/2022, 23:42:33] Alex Regueiro: True. Though maybe it's typically not a very noticeable or important one?
[31/10/2022, 23:43:42] Alice Lafferty: For me it's being too disagreeable and too system-orientated rather people-orientated than what is deemed appropriate in women, combined with physical unattractiveness.
[31/10/2022, 23:43:52] Alice Lafferty: Plus, as I said, red hair, a bit Jewish...
[31/10/2022, 23:43:59] Alice Lafferty: I am what they call an intersectional case
[31/10/2022, 23:44:15] Alice Lafferty: 'Multiply disadvantaged'
[31/10/2022, 23:44:26] Alex Regueiro: On the former point, that's a shame... we live in a time where essentialist views about sex, race, etc. have been revived
[31/10/2022, 23:44:36] Alex Regueiro: That's all the rage though, don't you know?
[31/10/2022, 23:45:06] Alex Regueiro: Hey, some people are drawn to that! But you're right it puts you as an outlier, for better or worse
[31/10/2022, 23:45:49] Alice Lafferty: I actually think most personality traits are value judgement neutral. Except maybe neuroticism.
[31/10/2022, 23:46:13] Alice Lafferty: Well actually maybe conscientiousness too
[31/10/2022, 23:46:18] Alice Lafferty: Let me rethink this...
[31/10/2022, 23:46:37] Alex Regueiro: Even if there are objective standards, there is so much variation that there always exists a small minority who like that "oddity". So take a little courage there.
[31/10/2022, 23:46:51] Alex Regueiro: Did you do a Big 5 test at some point?
[31/10/2022, 23:47:19] Alice Lafferty: Only internet ones.
[31/10/2022, 23:47:23] Alex Regueiro: Same
[31/10/2022, 23:47:39] Alice Lafferty: I bet I could make a good guess at your results.
[31/10/2022, 23:47:46] Alex Regueiro: Oh do!
[31/10/2022, 23:47:55] Alex Regueiro: I won't take offence, I promise
[31/10/2022, 23:48:22] Alex Regueiro: Then you can tell me yours. Since you already half-revealed them.
[31/10/2022, 23:48:55] Alice Lafferty: High in openness, high in conscientiousness, ~medium agreeableness, ~medium neuroticism (for a man).
[31/10/2022, 23:49:07] Alice Lafferty: I've forgotten one?
[31/10/2022, 23:49:14] Alex Regueiro: Extroversion
[31/10/2022, 23:49:21] Alex Regueiro: I always forget that one too haha
[31/10/2022, 23:49:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes, introverted.
[31/10/2022, 23:49:38] Alex Regueiro: how much, to be clear?
[31/10/2022, 23:49:54] Alice Lafferty: Like 25th percentile for extroversion
[31/10/2022, 23:50:22] Alice Lafferty: Maybe lower? I don't know.
[31/10/2022, 23:50:24] Alex Regueiro: That's pretty accurate. Sometimes I think I'm only moderately high in openness or conscientiousness, but other people tell me this too.
[31/10/2022, 23:51:10] Alice Lafferty: Yes I did wonder because the more open you are, the more liberal you tend to be.
[31/10/2022, 23:51:11] Alex Regueiro: Seems about right. I'm not right at the bottom, like a hermit or 'otaku', but yeah 20th-25th percentile is fair.
[31/10/2022, 23:51:34] Alex Regueiro: True, though with notable exceptions I think. I've read/watched a bit on that.
[31/10/2022, 23:51:57] Alice Lafferty: Would love to see data on how it correlates with disgust reactions.
[31/10/2022, 23:52:18] Alice Lafferty: Highly
[31/10/2022, 23:52:23] Alice Lafferty: I guess
[31/10/2022, 23:52:42] Alex Regueiro: But maybe it's reflected in my distaste for placing myself on the 1D political spectrum, or a sort of eclecticism when it comes to political and philosophical views? Or I could just be flattering myself heh
[31/10/2022, 23:52:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I'd guess the same
[31/10/2022, 23:52:52] Alex Regueiro: Okay, now yours?
[31/10/2022, 23:53:14] Alice Lafferty: Are you going to guess?
[31/10/2022, 23:53:36] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, it's really interesting how heritable these traits are on the whole. And indeed conservatism. There's a fair bit of variation in my extended family, but some clear trends too.
[31/10/2022, 23:53:41] Alex Regueiro: If you like?
[31/10/2022, 23:54:04] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I'm interested.
[31/10/2022, 23:56:16] Alex Regueiro: Medium-high in openness, high in conscientiousness, medium-high agreeableness, medium neuroticism.
[31/10/2022, 23:56:32] Alex Regueiro: Trying to think whether I adjusted those levels for female averages, not sure!
[31/10/2022, 23:57:07] Alice Lafferty: Haha you think I'm high in agreeableness? Interesting
[31/10/2022, 23:57:22] Alex Regueiro: medium-high
[31/10/2022, 23:57:39] Alex Regueiro: I mean, maybe because I rate myself kind of low there, I think most people are higher than me haha
[31/10/2022, 23:57:44] Alice Lafferty: I get low-medium. Although maybe we're not our own best judges.
[31/10/2022, 23:57:48] Alex Regueiro: My agreeable is very context-dependent
[31/10/2022, 23:57:52] Alex Regueiro: agreeableness*
[31/10/2022, 23:57:54] Alex Regueiro: VERY
[31/10/2022, 23:58:15] Alice Lafferty: Me too.
[31/10/2022, 23:58:47] Alice Lafferty: I surprise myself with how short I can be with people.
[31/10/2022, 23:58:51] Alice Lafferty: Not a good trait.
[31/10/2022, 23:59:01] Alex Regueiro: Possibly I'm naturally on the low side but it's partially mitigated by British mannerisms. üòÄ
[01/11/2022, 00:00:25] Alex Regueiro: As long as you understand it about yourself and realise when it is and isn't appropriate/constructive, I think it's no problem. Better than being a pushover. We sometimes forget how much ultra-agreeable people suffer.
[01/11/2022, 00:00:26] Alex Regueiro: How about the others?
[01/11/2022, 00:00:52] Alice Lafferty: Very true. See it in my mother all the time.
[01/11/2022, 00:01:50] Alex Regueiro: My mother isn't particularly agreeable for a woman, but I have one good woman friend who is 100% that way.
[01/11/2022, 00:02:34] Alex Regueiro: She's learnt recently though. Such a kind-hearted soul by nature. The irony, given her biological father was a borderline psycopath.
[01/11/2022, 00:02:37] Alice Lafferty: They seem accurate, or at least they match with how I describe myself, except that I am not particularly conscientious. Maybe medium. I've literally dropped out of university.
[01/11/2022, 00:03:01] Alice Lafferty: Remember
[01/11/2022, 00:03:27] Alice Lafferty: I get fits and bursts of conscientiousness.
[01/11/2022, 00:04:54] Alice Lafferty: Hm, it does seem that some traits are trauma-formed, esp people-pleasing.
[01/11/2022, 00:08:28] Alex Regueiro: It's an odd one. I've dropped out of a few things too or "converted down", and wouldn't say I'm good at seeing projects through to the end unless I'm super interested. But other people tend to rate my high on conscientiousness.
[01/11/2022, 00:08:32] Alex Regueiro: Good to know anyway
[01/11/2022, 00:10:04] Alex Regueiro: I'd say so too. Though in her case her mother is exactly the same on this count, and she had a very gentle and easy upbringing, I'm told. Her father's upbringing possibly brought out the worst in him. Or maybe she and her two siblings just got fairly lucky with the genetic lottery.
[01/11/2022, 00:11:27] Alex Regueiro: So are you more like your mum or dad in personality?
[01/11/2022, 00:12:12] Alice Lafferty: Suggests medium then.
[01/11/2022, 00:12:32] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Or context-dependent again, hah.
[01/11/2022, 00:12:38] Alice Lafferty: My dad certainly. I resemble him physically as well. Bad luck.
[01/11/2022, 00:13:06] Alex Regueiro: I can be amazingly focused and thorough about some things
[01/11/2022, 00:13:20] Alex Regueiro: Hah I see
[01/11/2022, 00:13:25] Alice Lafferty: Me and my mum are really so different that it's sometimes difficult for us to communicate about very simple issues. What about you?
[01/11/2022, 00:13:32] Alex Regueiro: So you've had a rough time being a redhead, you'd say?
[01/11/2022, 00:14:58] Alice Lafferty: I've caught some flak, yes. Anything that marks you out as different as a teenager is bad.
[01/11/2022, 00:15:35] Alice Lafferty: It gave me a weird superiority-inferiority complex.
[01/11/2022, 00:15:56] Alice Lafferty: I imagine it's not so different from being well above average in height?
[01/11/2022, 00:15:58] Alex Regueiro: My dad and I are really similar in a few personality traits and we have a few eccentricities in common, but my temperament and general outlook is much more like my mum (she's more of an introvert to boot).
[01/11/2022, 00:16:35] Alice Lafferty: It might be a more 'positive' difference though.
[01/11/2022, 00:16:54] Alex Regueiro: I think I can empathise with that (just not on hair colour)
[01/11/2022, 00:17:28] Alice Lafferty: I guess people (including me) come up to you and just state: 'you're very tall.' As if you didn't know?
[01/11/2022, 00:18:07] Alice Lafferty: Especially at school people would simply open a conversation with: 'you have red/ginger hair.'
[01/11/2022, 00:19:10] Alex Regueiro: Depends on the scenario. With women it usually is, and in some sports, but on the other hand: low ceilings, small clothes, people getting intimidated too easily, getting teased as a kid (you know the sort).
[01/11/2022, 00:19:56] Alex Regueiro: I didn't have the natural hand-eye coordination or athleticism to make it count in sports as a kid though.
[01/11/2022, 00:20:24] Alice Lafferty: I think having red hair and being 6'4 both appear in a population at about the same frequency. 1 in 100?
[01/11/2022, 00:20:45] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I can relate there
[01/11/2022, 00:20:55] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, very similar sort of thing. Tiresome. If someone says it these days and I'm feeling waspish I'll say something like "You're very observant. What else?"
[01/11/2022, 00:21:49] Alex Regueiro: My height is the top 0.5% last time I checked, but yeah sounds about right. Depends on country eh? Ireland might be less rare on both counts heh
[01/11/2022, 00:21:56] Alice Lafferty: ‚úãguilty
[01/11/2022, 00:22:40] Alex Regueiro: My mum is 5'11", and by her own admission incredibly clumsy. Safe to say she did NOT enjoy sports growing up haha.
[01/11/2022, 00:23:36] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, is there tallness on your dad's side as well?
[01/11/2022, 00:23:45] Alex Regueiro: Yep, both
[01/11/2022, 00:24:30] Alex Regueiro: His maternal grandfather was tall. Remarkably so for a (southern) Italian woman. The men on my mum's side are tall all-round though.
[01/11/2022, 00:24:34] Alex Regueiro: How about yours?
[01/11/2022, 00:27:33] Alice Lafferty: Hm, on my dad and uncles are 6'-6'2. My mum's family is short-average.
[01/11/2022, 00:28:03] Alice Lafferty: This is becoming a point of contention for my brothers who are anxious about what height they'll end upZ
[01/11/2022, 00:28:08] Alice Lafferty: *
[01/11/2022, 00:28:26] Alex Regueiro: Very in line with Irish and Jewish stereotypes you could say
[01/11/2022, 00:29:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes! Maternal grandparents have the noses too.
[01/11/2022, 00:29:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I bet. I only had a younger sister for competition. We still occasionally tease her for being the short one at 5'8". üòâ
[01/11/2022, 00:30:01] Alex Regueiro: You're a good height though, honestly
[01/11/2022, 00:30:17] Alice Lafferty: I think I'm dead average?
[01/11/2022, 00:30:26] Alex Regueiro: I think so
[01/11/2022, 00:30:34] Alice Lafferty: Something like 5'4 or 5'5.
[01/11/2022, 00:31:02] Alice Lafferty: I think women's height is basically a non-issue unless >5'11 maybe
[01/11/2022, 00:31:23] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. 6' is sometimes the cut off line.
[01/11/2022, 00:31:48] Alex Regueiro: Below 5'2" it starts becoming an issue for me, but otherwise it's fine
[01/11/2022, 00:32:54] Alex Regueiro: Just because I'm really tall though
[01/11/2022, 00:33:30] Alice Lafferty: That makes sense. Do you have any other physiological standards I should know about
[01/11/2022, 00:33:40] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[01/11/2022, 00:34:09] Alex Regueiro: I'm not too judgemental otherwise, I hope! Hair colour I'm very open on
[01/11/2022, 00:34:15] Alex Regueiro: You?
[01/11/2022, 00:34:45] Alice Lafferty: It's weird because I didn't actually pick you at all based on your height. I simply don't notice it when looking at someone's profile.
[01/11/2022, 00:35:16] Alice Lafferty: No!
[01/11/2022, 00:36:12] Alex Regueiro: I remember you saying. In fact for a decent minority of women it's not terribly important. And that's fine, as long as you're not put off. üôÇ
[01/11/2022, 00:36:22] Alex Regueiro: Good!
[01/11/2022, 00:37:09] Alice Lafferty: I don't feel particularly optimistic after our conversation.
[01/11/2022, 00:37:17] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean?
[01/11/2022, 00:38:05] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally I hope I'm not tiring out your texting thumbs here. (This is easy for me on my laptop.)
[01/11/2022, 00:38:06] Alice Lafferty: Evolutionary psychology gets me down more than almost anything. I'll have to go find some vapid cheerful media.
[01/11/2022, 00:38:14] Alex Regueiro: Oh I see
[01/11/2022, 00:38:57] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry. I didn't really know that people used WhatsApp on laptops, but I guess why not.
[01/11/2022, 00:39:00] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I get that. It's a bit soul-sapping. So materialist-reductionist and diametrically opposed to transcendental values and religion, isn't it? I'd love to reconcile them properly one day.
[01/11/2022, 00:39:46] Alex Regueiro: When you're on the computer as much as me for work/projects, it makes sense, but otherwise not really.
[01/11/2022, 00:40:55] Alice Lafferty: Yes. I think it would only work if evolution was teleological in some sense, but it isn't. 

I think I would withdraw completely from the 'sexual marketplace' if not for the stigma of being a single woman.
[01/11/2022, 00:41:18] Alex Regueiro: Try this. I know you won't have finished my playlist yet, but who knows, it might lift your spirits. Prog, religion, and medievalism all wrapped into one. üôÇ
[01/11/2022, 00:41:26] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tna0Mmu1XlI
[01/11/2022, 00:42:42] Alice Lafferty: Thanks. You've given me so much good stuff to listen to.
[01/11/2022, 00:43:11] Alex Regueiro: That's interesting. I've heard other women say that, even though arguably the stigma against social women has never been lower in history. I do concede it very much exists still, however. For men too, to a lesser extent. And I'm glad it's not the case.
[01/11/2022, 00:43:45] Alex Regueiro: I'm glad. Though I'll give you a break now.
[01/11/2022, 00:44:36] Alice Lafferty: Plus I have to go back and watch those videos.
[01/11/2022, 00:44:57] Alice Lafferty: It's ok, I save it all and will get round to listening to it.
[01/11/2022, 00:46:01] Alex Regueiro: Don't think I asked, did any of the Bach pieces strike a particular chord with you? (Har har)
[01/11/2022, 00:46:08] Alice Lafferty: Hm our cultural understanding of womanhood is largely based on desirability.
[01/11/2022, 00:46:52] Alex Regueiro: You're right. That aspect has persisted across the Sexual Revolution. Perhaps it's unavoidable, and for men too in its own way.
[01/11/2022, 00:47:53] Alice Lafferty: Symphony for Strings in B-minor?
[01/11/2022, 00:48:02] Alex Regueiro: Oh that's the Telemann one
[01/11/2022, 00:48:10] Alex Regueiro: A good friend of Bach, mind you
[01/11/2022, 00:48:17] Alex Regueiro: Oh no, that's the CPE Bach one
[01/11/2022, 00:48:19] Alex Regueiro: his son
[01/11/2022, 00:48:48] Alice Lafferty: Well! Sorry about that
[01/11/2022, 00:48:59] Alice Lafferty: Not J.S
[01/11/2022, 00:49:39] Alex Regueiro: Hah it's all good. I love CPE, he's underrated. Such a dynamic idiosyncratic style. Not quite the ability of his father, but more accessible maybe.
[01/11/2022, 00:50:33] Alice Lafferty: It's very similar to the Concerto for Two Harpsichords. 

Did he do anything slower or in a minor chord?
[01/11/2022, 00:51:15] Alex Regueiro: Hmm? They're both in minor keys.
[01/11/2022, 00:52:14] Alice Lafferty: :( I don't know enough about music. I use 'minor' as a byword for 'sad'.
[01/11/2022, 00:52:16] Alice Lafferty: Sorry!
[01/11/2022, 00:52:34] Alice Lafferty: Where did I get that from?
[01/11/2022, 00:52:54] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. It's usually fair to equate them yes!
[01/11/2022, 00:53:19] Alex Regueiro: But JS Bach, and maybe CPE too, have a rare knack for making minor-key pieces sound joyful
[01/11/2022, 00:53:22] Alex Regueiro: Which did you mean?
[01/11/2022, 00:55:17] Alice Lafferty: I liked them both. I thought the CPE piece on your playlist was quite similar Bach Sr's Concerto for Two Harpsichords.
[01/11/2022, 00:55:51] Alex Regueiro: I mean, you were asking if CPE did anything sadder/slower?
[01/11/2022, 00:55:52] Alice Lafferty: I picked up that idea about the minor key from somewhere without fully understanding it.
[01/11/2022, 00:56:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes, 'music to mope to'.
[01/11/2022, 00:56:33] Alex Regueiro: It's a good rule of thumb. Not always so simpel though.
[01/11/2022, 00:56:37] Alice Lafferty: Maybe that was above him.
[01/11/2022, 00:56:38] Alex Regueiro: Okay. let me have a think
[01/11/2022, 00:57:01] Alex Regueiro: (Even though I promised you no more for the moment heh)
[01/11/2022, 00:57:09] Alice Lafferty: A lot of 'sad' music feels kind of manipulative.
[01/11/2022, 00:57:55] Alex Regueiro: Some of the romantic stuff definitely can be. Mawkish.
[01/11/2022, 00:58:21] Alex Regueiro: (Romantic meaning the 1800s that is)
[01/11/2022, 00:58:29] Alice Lafferty: I don't know the right terminology but sometimes it sounds 'plaintive', like how this becomes at about 4:20 https://open.spotify.com/track/1vU8oht1BqabFD6A3cqS6M?si=fskiZNo3S8aAEq_dEQfFQw
[01/11/2022, 00:59:32] Alex Regueiro: (listening)
[01/11/2022, 01:01:25] Alex Regueiro: The master üôÇ
[01/11/2022, 01:02:25] Alex Regueiro: Yes, plaintive is apt. I think it's the lyrical phrasing that gives the impression of someone weeping almost
[01/11/2022, 01:02:31] Alex Regueiro: If that makes sense?
[01/11/2022, 01:03:20] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[01/11/2022, 01:04:19] Alex Regueiro: Looking through my CPE Bach now for something mournfil... Ah, I should have had you listen to La Casa del Diavolo today! Great piece regardless.
[01/11/2022, 01:04:50] Alex Regueiro: At least, that's the name it has on my album
[01/11/2022, 01:05:04] Alice Lafferty: It does. Maybe Chopin just captures something which no other composer really does, which I'm willing to accept.
[01/11/2022, 01:05:38] Alice Lafferty: Plus I should just listen to Bach as Bach.
[01/11/2022, 01:05:50] Alice Lafferty: Rather than trying to replicate the experience of listening to Chopin.
[01/11/2022, 01:06:29] Alex Regueiro: Chopin was an exquisitely sensitive and delicate soul. His music is often called feminine, but I'm not sure that's quite right. He was a pure Romantic though. Thankfully he's so masterful he can usually avoid getting saccharine.
[01/11/2022, 01:06:57] Alex Regueiro: Yes, you should. But much easier said than done.
[01/11/2022, 01:07:00] Alex Regueiro: Give it time
[01/11/2022, 01:07:36] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Really the perfect balance between pathos & restraint.
[01/11/2022, 01:08:28] Alice Lafferty: I am enjoying it, I'm just a misery and wallowing in negative emotions is pleasurable in a way.
[01/11/2022, 01:08:36] Alice Lafferty: *I'm a misery
[01/11/2022, 01:09:33] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely!
[01/11/2022, 01:14:56] Alex Regueiro: It's proving surprisingly hard to find a mournful CPE Bach piece. The odd movement, though it wasn't really his style...
[01/11/2022, 01:15:17] Alex Regueiro: JS did more. Lots of religious compositions
[01/11/2022, 01:15:37] Alice Lafferty: Right up my street then
[01/11/2022, 01:17:56] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[01/11/2022, 01:18:13] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLIv8FAVr58
[01/11/2022, 01:18:19] Alex Regueiro: Maybe that's the closest I have in my collection
[01/11/2022, 01:18:52] Alex Regueiro: Just a movement. The work is a cheerful one overall, since it's called the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus.
[01/11/2022, 01:18:53] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry if you can't find any, I can have a look myself too. 

I may go to sleep now. Thank you for the recs. It's good to have these sensory and intellectual treats to compensate for the fact of living in what may be an entirely ontologically evil world.
[01/11/2022, 01:23:07] Alex Regueiro: Even if our world isn't necessarily ontologically evil, it's things like great music that help make life so much more bearable. And it may sound trite, but sharing our thoughts and feelings with people can understand, which I'd like to think we've done!
[01/11/2022, 01:23:22] Alex Regueiro: people who can understand*
[01/11/2022, 01:24:16] Alex Regueiro: That little hiccup aside, I really enjoyed chatting again. üôÇ
[01/11/2022, 01:24:48] Alice Lafferty: My theodicy by the way: an adaptation of divine 'kenosis' (meaning 'emptying oneself of oneself'). We can say that the the universe is a space carved out of God and a privation of divinity.
[01/11/2022, 01:25:02] Alice Lafferty: As you can tell my mood is very good tonight.
[01/11/2022, 01:25:24] Alice Lafferty: Me too. If you get bored of talking to me, you can just say, I won't be offended.
[01/11/2022, 01:25:28] Alice Lafferty: Goodnight
[01/11/2022, 01:25:57] Alex Regueiro: Also, if you're in the mood for a spiritual voyage through J S Bach at some point, try his Mass in B minor or St John Passion. Maybe in the abridged versions! Masterpieces in any case.
[01/11/2022, 01:26:03] Alex Regueiro: Good night, Alice
[01/11/2022, 01:26:43] Alex Regueiro: Intriguing. Elaborate some other time.
[01/11/2022, 01:26:55] Alex Regueiro: üò¥
[01/11/2022, 17:20:48] Alex Regueiro: Hey Alice. Hope the existential pessimism has passed quickly and you're having a nice day! (HTML/Python is  good distraction at least.) Would you be up for seeing each other again soon? Before we both get fed up of the all the texting, that is. Perhaps I could tempt you to join me for a concert in London?
[01/11/2022, 18:13:53] Alice Lafferty: Hello
[01/11/2022, 18:14:27] Alice Lafferty: Yes, that sounds nice. Did you have something specific in mind?
[01/11/2022, 21:16:05] Alex Regueiro: Great
[01/11/2022, 21:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I'd already looked at a few, since I was planning to go to one with a friend too.
[01/11/2022, 21:18:29] Alex Regueiro: Three different venues. First two are for chamber music, whereas the Barbican is a symphony hall as you probably know.
[01/11/2022, 21:19:03] Alex Regueiro: https://www.sjss.org.uk/events/southbank-sinfonia-13

https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2022/event/royal-concertgebouw-orchestraharding-leonidas-kavakos
[01/11/2022, 21:19:19] Alex Regueiro: They all look good, so totally your choice.üôÇ
[01/11/2022, 21:20:34] Alex Regueiro: And excuse the slow reply. I was cooking/eating dinner. What do you usually have, for that matter?
[01/11/2022, 21:39:14] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Are you sure you don't have a preference?
[01/11/2022, 21:40:11] Alice Lafferty: The Southbank Sinfonia looks interesting?
[01/11/2022, 21:41:23] Alice Lafferty: But I'm not really familiar with the music, so I don't know!
[01/11/2022, 21:48:42] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry, I'm much worse at replying. Well, I just eat with my parents usually. My mum is quite into cooking. She's living in 2012 and makes a lot of Ottolenghi recipes. But also potatoes seem to feature quite heavily (dad's influence...)
[01/11/2022, 21:48:48] Alice Lafferty: What about you?
[01/11/2022, 22:13:36] Alex Regueiro: Not really. There's not much between them. Depends what takes your fancy really!
[01/11/2022, 22:15:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that one's a bit uniquer. The Brahms piece is great. I don't know the Vaughan Williams one but he's usually good. First one is contemporary and a mystery.
[01/11/2022, 22:16:25] Alex Regueiro: Barbican Hall is imposing and a world-class orchestra but St Johns is a nicer venue for sure.
[01/11/2022, 22:18:08] Alex Regueiro: Oh interesting. I've never been to an Ottolenghi restaurant, but I remember when they were super hip. Some day perhaps.
[01/11/2022, 22:18:36] Alex Regueiro: Nothing wrong with some good old taters. üôÇ
[01/11/2022, 22:19:22] Alex Regueiro: Pasta features a fair bit, as does Asian food.
[01/11/2022, 22:19:37] Alice Lafferty: I'm not a huge fan of the Barbican architecturally.
[01/11/2022, 22:20:10] Alex Regueiro: Like going for Indian meals regularly too.
[01/11/2022, 22:20:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm with you there. Marginally better than the Royal Festival Hall though, perhaps? I think our late Prince Philip called both of them carbuncles at some point.
[01/11/2022, 22:21:16] Alice Lafferty: Yes same. My mum's kind of jumped on the carb demonisation band wagon though recently. Don't get a lot of pasta round here :(
[01/11/2022, 22:21:49] Alice Lafferty: She's also a vegetarian. It's getting to the point where her and my dad eat almost entirely different meals some nights.
[01/11/2022, 22:22:54] Alice Lafferty: He had a famous way with words.
[01/11/2022, 22:23:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh dear. I like my carbs way too much for that. I reckon as long as you're not completely sedentary it's fine. Italians have loads of carbs and yet are long lived, right? Same with southern French I think.
[01/11/2022, 22:23:51] Alex Regueiro: I should warn you, I'm mainly vegetarian too. I have fish occasionally. But I'm not judgemental about it, at least. Hope that doesn't bother you.
[01/11/2022, 22:24:06] Alex Regueiro: He did indeed. Rubbed some people the wrong way but for the most part I found him entertaining.
[01/11/2022, 22:24:18] Alice Lafferty: Eh, I don't take government dietary advice too seriously. In the 20th C it was fat, now carbs are out... their reputation will be rehabilitated at some point.
[01/11/2022, 22:24:39] Alice Lafferty: In the meantime I will continue to eat bread, pasta etc.
[01/11/2022, 22:25:07] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. Swings and roundabouts. I tend to obey the old maxim, "everything in moderation including moderation".
[01/11/2022, 22:26:09] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. The 'mediterranean diet' that they were pushing for a while was so obviously just romanticism.
[01/11/2022, 22:26:38] Alice Lafferty: I am outside and my fingers are cold so I'm typing at half my regular speed. So sorry
[01/11/2022, 22:27:57] Alex Regueiro: It was. I mean, sure, Italians and southern French and some Greeks do have more fish, olive oil and whatnot compared to northern Europeans. But they also have a lot of starch and a decent amount of meat and fat.
[01/11/2022, 22:28:01] Alice Lafferty: I'm not a committed vegetarian, but I actually don't eat meat so often any more either. I could easily give it up.
[01/11/2022, 22:28:31] Alex Regueiro: No worries at all. What you up to?
[01/11/2022, 22:28:38] Alice Lafferty: On the other hand I would consider giving up eggs & dairy a huge personal loss.
[01/11/2022, 22:30:18] Alice Lafferty: Just walking my dog
[01/11/2022, 22:30:25] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. Since I've been back at my parents' place I've actually gotten them to eat much less meat without ever proselytising to them. Subtle influence by example, the fact it's easier to make one family meal, and moreover introducing them to lots of good alternatives and substitutes for meat.
[01/11/2022, 22:30:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I could never do that I think. The vegan diet is just too restrictive and dull for me.
[01/11/2022, 22:32:00] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, one thing that makes me reluctant about vegetarianism is the poor quality of the meat substitutes atm... what do you use?
[01/11/2022, 22:32:52] Alice Lafferty: Me and my mum have a 'quorn test' where we slip meat substitutes into food and see if my dad notices.
[01/11/2022, 22:32:55] Alice Lafferty: He usually does.
[01/11/2022, 22:32:59] Alex Regueiro: When I'm living by myself I'm shamefully lazy with cooking though. Would like to think I'm a decent cook, but unless I have plenty of free time and no work, I kind of dislike it.
[01/11/2022, 22:33:11] Alex Regueiro: Haha I like that
[01/11/2022, 22:34:44] Alice Lafferty: I'll become a vegan when they can mimic the exact taste and mouthfeel of butter. Until then...
[01/11/2022, 22:35:07] Alex Regueiro: I think the quality of meat substitutes has gone up hugely in recent years. Both at home and in restaurants. With Chinese/Thai food (like tonight), tofu plus veg is an easy choice. With Indian it's paneer! Linda McCartney does a really good range I find. The meatballs, burgers, and Chinese-style duck. There are some other goods brands too though. Eating out I've actually fooled people with the Beyond Meat burger.
[01/11/2022, 22:35:43] Alex Regueiro: For me the benchmark is probably tasty vegan cheese / good texture. But yeah, butter too.
[01/11/2022, 22:35:45] Alice Lafferty: I don't mind cooking, I'm just not that good at it. Plus I have kind of a restricted palate unfortunately.
[01/11/2022, 22:36:51] Alex Regueiro: That's fair enough. I was really picky as a kid. These days much less bad, I'd say, but there's still some foods I won't touch.
[01/11/2022, 22:36:56] Alice Lafferty: My mum gets the Linda McCartney stuff. But they're like lentil/bean burgers right? I'm thinking of the soy derivatives, which I have textural difficulty with.
[01/11/2022, 22:38:00] Alex Regueiro: I think they're a mixture of soy and legumes? Been a while since I checked. "Plant Kitchen" does some good stuff too.
[01/11/2022, 22:38:25] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure my mum will have tried these, I'll ask her.
[01/11/2022, 22:38:50] Alex Regueiro: Beyond Meat is amazing both in texture and taste. 'Impossible' too
[01/11/2022, 22:39:21] Alice Lafferty: If a meal is meat free, I don't mind some kind of vegetable or dairy substitute which does not masquerade as meat.
[01/11/2022, 22:39:31] Alex Regueiro: What breed dog do you have? I know nothing about them mind you. Was just thinking of the poor woofers with vegan owners who don't even give them meat.
[01/11/2022, 22:39:48] Alice Lafferty: Like cheese, mushrooms, can provide that umami type flavour.
[01/11/2022, 22:41:28] Alice Lafferty: Springer spaniel. Currently quadruped, soon to be a tripod. He has cancer in his hind leg and is having it amputated on the 7th!
[01/11/2022, 22:41:31] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's quite true. Indian and East Asian is great for a vegetarian because they have long histories of vegetarians and their cuisines have developed to accommodate it. Somehow Italian, Greek, and Middle Eastern are easy for veggies too.
[01/11/2022, 22:42:14] Alice Lafferty: Probably still better than my dog's diet.
[01/11/2022, 22:43:01] Alex Regueiro: Hah really?
[01/11/2022, 22:43:32] Alice Lafferty: Yes, lack of native spices in NW Europe means without meat it quickly becomes a game of 'how many ways to cook this potato?'
[01/11/2022, 22:43:53] Alex Regueiro: Springer spaniels seem nice (looked it up to remind me). Is he old?
[01/11/2022, 22:44:45] Alice Lafferty: She actually mentioned 'Impossible'. Says quorn is bad.
[01/11/2022, 22:44:46] Alex Regueiro: Quite so. And I can't think of any northern European cuisine that is good for veggies. Frankly, Russian cuisine is awful whatever your diet.
[01/11/2022, 22:45:13] Alex Regueiro: I was wary of dissing quorn but yeah I can't stand it personally!
[01/11/2022, 22:45:45] Alice Lafferty: Why are you a vegetarian? Is it an ethical position?
[01/11/2022, 22:46:17] Alice Lafferty: I'm back indoors and am going to quickly run my fingers under a hot tap.
[01/11/2022, 22:46:35] Alex Regueiro: Yeah largely. I'm a softie when it comes to animals. Seeing/reading some things about modern farming practices, factory farming, kind of disturbed me. Also my Oxford college was really into it (and environmentalism). Must have affected me subliminally.
[01/11/2022, 22:46:50] Alex Regueiro: Very sensible
[01/11/2022, 22:47:53] Alice Lafferty: But then how can you eat dairy in good conscience?
[01/11/2022, 22:48:35] Alice Lafferty: I agree that it seems barbaric but in many ways the dairy industry is worse because the exploitation is more sustained.
[01/11/2022, 22:48:40] Alex Regueiro: I know... Partly I just don't live up to my own standards, but I think I can still rightly say that dairy cows/calves wouldn't be killed without the meat industry
[01/11/2022, 22:49:27] Alex Regueiro: The way they separate calves from mothers in abhorrent. There are plenty of farms these days that don't practice that, though I concede I don't always know if the milk/cheese I have does that.
[01/11/2022, 22:49:49] Alice Lafferty: This is why I was interested in farming and ecology for a while. I was trying to think of an ethical way to produce dairy.
[01/11/2022, 22:50:42] Alice Lafferty: https://mossgielfarm.co.uk/about/our-campaigns/calf-with-cow/
[01/11/2022, 22:50:52] Alice Lafferty: You might be interested in this.
[01/11/2022, 22:51:27] Alice Lafferty: A method of dairy farming 'calf-with-cow' that does not separate the mother and calf.
[01/11/2022, 22:51:45] Alice Lafferty: I've looked into it a bit but there are very few farms like this operating in the UK
[01/11/2022, 22:52:05] Alice Lafferty: And the produce is very expensive because it's such an inefficient way to farm.
[01/11/2022, 22:52:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I've mused over that too. I think it's possible, but not without a substantial cost hit. The big issue is that it's antithetical to capitalism and economy of scale.
[01/11/2022, 22:52:28] Alex Regueiro: Interesting, I'll have a look, thanks!
[01/11/2022, 22:53:56] Alice Lafferty: I do buy supermarket organic dairy but I think that the Soil Association mainly prescribe the cow's diet rather than living standards.
[01/11/2022, 22:54:31] Alice Lafferty: That might not have been the best example actually. There are probably other resources which explain how it works a bit better.
[01/11/2022, 22:55:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, "organic" by itself doesn't mean too much, unfortunately. "Free range" is usually better, but even so...
[01/11/2022, 22:57:20] Alice Lafferty: Not a criticism but I don't understand why people associate utility maximisation with capitalism.
[01/11/2022, 22:58:11] Alice Lafferty: I don't see why say a command economy wouldn't function in much the same way.
[01/11/2022, 22:58:57] Alex Regueiro: I think because capitalism inherently drives producers to make ethical shortcuts (and all other shortcuts) for the sake of lowering prices and outcompeting rivals.
[01/11/2022, 22:59:51] Alex Regueiro: It all depends on the principals of the command economy I suppose... they come in many different flavours. But it's not necessarily unique to capitalism, I'll agree there.
[01/11/2022, 23:00:16] Alice Lafferty: It seems to me that that's only part of it. It's more like a simple issue of land economy.
[01/11/2022, 23:00:32] Alice Lafferty: And man power.
[01/11/2022, 23:00:34] Alex Regueiro: For the record, I'm actually largely pro-capitalist. Just have a distaste for neoliberalism and generally lack of regulaiton.
[01/11/2022, 23:01:38] Alex Regueiro: It's probably also a consequence simply of the technology we now have. Living conditions for animals were much better 200/300 years ago in large part because we didn't have the capabilities (technological and organisational) to exploit them so badly.
[01/11/2022, 23:02:14] Alice Lafferty: I don't know, it seems that if a Communist state practiced ethical farming, people would be like 'heheh look how inefficient they are' - what is sacrificed where if you have a food shortage etc.
[01/11/2022, 23:03:04] Alice Lafferty: I see. Are you more like a Keynesian?
[01/11/2022, 23:03:28] Alex Regueiro: Yes, perhaps I'm too harsh. I certainly agree that communist states and demonstrably awful at efficient or affordable food production (among most other products).
[01/11/2022, 23:04:23] Alice Lafferty: Yes, the self same technology which also eradicated food insecurity in the west.
[01/11/2022, 23:04:38] Alex Regueiro: In truth I know very little about economics. I really should educate myself on it more. I've read/watched more about the Austrian School and so much of it makes sense. But I still can't swallow its pure form, or neoliberalism.
[01/11/2022, 23:04:50] Alice Lafferty: I am sympathetic to your position.
[01/11/2022, 23:05:08] Alice Lafferty: It's not really a matter of food insecurity any more - we don't *need to eat meat.
[01/11/2022, 23:05:49] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely. We sit here very comfortably and so can have these "luxury beliefs" about animal welfare, but equally I think we have a duty to animals, and even more so if we can maintain a reliable and efficient system of agriculture at slightly-moderately increased cost whilst not completely abusing animals
[01/11/2022, 23:06:36] Alice Lafferty: We've kind of passed the time at which it might have been justifiable to harm animals, just on a calorie basis.
[01/11/2022, 23:06:52] Alice Lafferty: This is what permaculture is all about.
[01/11/2022, 23:06:55] Alex Regueiro: Right. I always say that our situation is totally different to our ancestors', who had much less choice of where they could get their energy and nutrition from... though ironically the peasants were 90% vegetarian anyway!
[01/11/2022, 23:08:00] Alex Regueiro: I'd be very interested in it. Please tell me about it in person, if you would. Or here, but that's probably much easier
[01/11/2022, 23:09:03] Alice Lafferty: I can tell you about it if you like but I am myself slowly moving away from it. I mean, briefly, it's also very much 'a luxury belief'.
[01/11/2022, 23:09:59] Alice Lafferty: We would not be able to feed 8B people using permaculture methods.
[01/11/2022, 23:10:08] Alex Regueiro: Sure. Still worth learning about probably?
[01/11/2022, 23:10:27] Alex Regueiro: I'm not very knowledgeable but I'm also a fan of vertical and urban agriculture.
[01/11/2022, 23:10:29] Alice Lafferty: Has 5-10% yield of conventional farming/sq foot or something like that.
[01/11/2022, 23:10:46] Alex Regueiro: which is the opposite to the above hah
[01/11/2022, 23:11:11] Alex Regueiro: Ideally in tandem with more traditional forms of agriculture, though
[01/11/2022, 23:11:15] Alice Lafferty: I think I've seen images of vertical farms... but I didn't get it.
[01/11/2022, 23:11:46] Alice Lafferty: If using artificial light, wouldn't the net energy input exceed output?
[01/11/2022, 23:11:50] Alex Regueiro: I support it mainly for efficiency and to be able to produce (very nearly) all of our essential food at home, and only import luxury foods.
[01/11/2022, 23:11:59] Alice Lafferty: What kind of lights do they use?
[01/11/2022, 23:12:17] Alex Regueiro: Mainly tailored LED lights I think.
[01/11/2022, 23:13:17] Alex Regueiro: That's always the case, merely by virtue of conservation of energy and no process being totally efficient. But yes, it does introduce an extra layer of inefficiency in terms of light. I think it can be offset in other ways though, and is fairly small with LEDs in any case.
[01/11/2022, 23:13:41] Alice Lafferty: I'm a huge proponent of British food self-sufficiency yes.
[01/11/2022, 23:13:56] Alex Regueiro: And no, I'm not at all a protectionist or mercantilist, but I do highly value self-sufficiency with food and energy to as high a degree as possible.
[01/11/2022, 23:14:22] Alex Regueiro: Apparently we're at 55%/60% at the moment, so it's not like we're lightyears off
[01/11/2022, 23:14:27] Alice Lafferty: It just seems pragmatic/ a form of 'future-proofing'
[01/11/2022, 23:14:32] Alex Regueiro: Precisely
[01/11/2022, 23:14:53] Alice Lafferty: And as nice as it is, we don't strictly need to be able to eat pineapples from South America in January.
[01/11/2022, 23:15:09] Alex Regueiro: It's just obviously prudent to me to insulate yourself against the caprices of global politics, natural disaster, and whatnot
[01/11/2022, 23:15:36] Alice Lafferty: But the energy from the sun is 'free' in a sense. I wonder vertical farming could possibly break even on carbon? I don't see how.
[01/11/2022, 23:15:47] Alice Lafferty: Unless the LEDs use renewables.
[01/11/2022, 23:16:08] Alice Lafferty: But there are so many middlemen in this situation.
[01/11/2022, 23:16:17] Alice Lafferty: I don't know, I'd need to look more into it.
[01/11/2022, 23:16:39] Alex Regueiro: Right. If the economy is doing well, and the free market permits them to be affordable, nothing terribly wrong with that (okay, hardcore environmentalists might say otherwise), but society expects all these luxury items these days that we could quite easily do with out. I mean, it wouldn't substantially decrease our standard of living.
[01/11/2022, 23:17:04] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly.
[01/11/2022, 23:17:14] Alice Lafferty: You're stuffed if you live in like, Dubai though.
[01/11/2022, 23:17:20] Alex Regueiro: So if everything goes to pot... we're not totally screwed as a country.
[01/11/2022, 23:17:38] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. You can't drink crude oil when the next crisis comes.
[01/11/2022, 23:18:04] Alice Lafferty: Lol
[01/11/2022, 23:19:05] Alice Lafferty: Haha did you see 'The Line'
[01/11/2022, 23:19:09] Alex Regueiro: Not likely right now, or we'd be all over it. But I think it's possibly in theory, with cheaper renewable energy (I'm including nuclear or even the dream of fusion). Anyway I'm not saying it's a magic wand, but it's certainly attractive in several ways. Worth investigating more.
[01/11/2022, 23:19:19] Alex Regueiro: I haven't no
[01/11/2022, 23:19:50] Alice Lafferty: It's in Saudi Arabia. Please please look it up. You won't believe it.
[01/11/2022, 23:20:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh wait. Maybe I have?
[01/11/2022, 23:21:13] Alice Lafferty: It's some hellish city compressed into 'a line' in the middle of a desert.
[01/11/2022, 23:21:23] Alex Regueiro: Ooh. Sounds VERY utopian. And you're right, I don't really believe the claims on the website. I'm very sceptical at least. Seems as fragile as hell, from a systems perspective.
[01/11/2022, 23:22:05] Alex Regueiro: I think there are other similar projects, like in the UAE, no? Maybe not quite so grandiose. Reminds me of the travesty that is the upcoming Qatar World Cup. But let's not go there right now.
[01/11/2022, 23:22:08] Alice Lafferty: I thought it would be one of those things that never actually gets built. Like Boris's 'garden bridge'. But apparently construction has already started.
[01/11/2022, 23:22:47] Alex Regueiro: Combination of autocracy and ridiculous oil wealth, eh
[01/11/2022, 23:23:07] Alice Lafferty: I honestly think they're trying to pivot from an oil based to a tourism based economy, which is insane...
[01/11/2022, 23:23:34] Alice Lafferty: Don't follow football but even I have heard lots of grumbling about that.
[01/11/2022, 23:24:00] Alex Regueiro: Come have the holiday of your life at the Line! (Don't forget Sharia law)
[01/11/2022, 23:24:31] Alice Lafferty: My hunch is that the sharia stuff will get dropped pretty sharpish.
[01/11/2022, 23:24:43] Alice Lafferty: At least on the face of things
[01/11/2022, 23:24:45] Alex Regueiro: It is. I know quite a few people who think Dubai is really cool, but I just don't get it. A cultural vacuum, all modern and artificial, sort of the worst of decadent civilisation
[01/11/2022, 23:24:55] Alice Lafferty: Need the western tourism dollar
[01/11/2022, 23:25:06] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it crossed my mind as I wrote it. They already turn a blind eye to a lot of stuff I understand.
[01/11/2022, 23:25:51] Alice Lafferty: I've never been to Dubai personally, but I know someone who has, and within these resorts religious laws are not observed at all.
[01/11/2022, 23:26:13] Alice Lafferty: Completely agree.
[01/11/2022, 23:26:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah fair. I know of lots of stories of tourists getting in trouble outside the resorts though. Even in transit from the airport.
[01/11/2022, 23:27:42] Alice Lafferty: Having said that devout Muslims have a much higher tfr so who knows.
[01/11/2022, 23:28:40] Alice Lafferty: Creepy isolated pleasure palace in the middle of an extremely hostile natural landscape.
[01/11/2022, 23:30:09] Alice Lafferty: Why does it seem fragile from a systems perspective?
[01/11/2022, 23:30:11] Alex Regueiro: This is the sort of nonsense that happens when you go from desert bedouins to a one-resource economy in 2-3 generations. There's mind-boggling dissonance at several levels. I actually respect the traditions and culture of their bedouin forebears much more in some ways
[01/11/2022, 23:30:21] Alex Regueiro: tfr?
[01/11/2022, 23:30:25] Alex Regueiro: Haha right
[01/11/2022, 23:30:39] Alice Lafferty: 'Barbarism to decadence without civilisation in between'
[01/11/2022, 23:30:54] Alice Lafferty: I know originally about the US but still.
[01/11/2022, 23:30:56] Alex Regueiro: Hah that's the one! I love that Oscar Wilde wquote
[01/11/2022, 23:31:03] Alex Regueiro: indeed, originally about the US in the 1890s I think
[01/11/2022, 23:31:15] Alex Regueiro: little did he know it would apply much better to today's US
[01/11/2022, 23:31:33] Alice Lafferty: Total fertility rate
[01/11/2022, 23:32:31] Alex Regueiro: Ecologically? It's in a bloody desert like you said, and requires ridiculous amounts of energy. There's nothing self-sustaining or balanced about it. Sort of the opposite of permaculture. But also economically unstable (all funded by oil sales and reliant on the continuation of high oil price and high demand). And then politically as well, I'd argue...
[01/11/2022, 23:32:37] Alex Regueiro: oh right
[01/11/2022, 23:33:01] Alice Lafferty: All I can think is that if the end to end transport system faults at just one juncture, then the whole thing is unusable.
[01/11/2022, 23:33:16] Alice Lafferty: They're going to have like a high speed train from end to end
[01/11/2022, 23:33:26] Alice Lafferty: 170km in 20 minutes.
[01/11/2022, 23:33:44] Alex Regueiro: Yep, in terms of engineering and transport too, absolutely.
[01/11/2022, 23:34:08] Alex Regueiro: That seems to always nosedive the richer and more comfortable a populace gets though.
[01/11/2022, 23:34:19] Alice Lafferty: Right, they must import literally everything?
[01/11/2022, 23:34:37] Alice Lafferty: Water?
[01/11/2022, 23:35:01] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. It's got to be one of the least fertile and least hydrated of Earth's well-inhabited areas.
[01/11/2022, 23:35:03] Alice Lafferty: Constant air conditioning to stop people dying of heat exhaustion? Scary. I would not want to live there.
[01/11/2022, 23:35:48] Alice Lafferty: Right, I think they can see the gold rush is coming to an end.
[01/11/2022, 23:36:39] Alex Regueiro: So many reasons. The handful we've already listed between us are enormous though. Sure, you can do most things with a huge energy supply in the 21st C (desalination of seawater even), but that's economically so fragile for obvious reasons, and you're literally as far away from homeostasis with the environment as you get. Dangerous.
[01/11/2022, 23:36:47] Alice Lafferty: But hey I guess they'll have solar power
[01/11/2022, 23:37:20] Alex Regueiro: Yep. They say they've been transitioning for a decade or two now. But I still don't think they've quite twigged how dependent on huge amounts of readily available cheap energy they are.
[01/11/2022, 23:37:55] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Then there's still the problem of dependency on metals (both common and rare earth)...
[01/11/2022, 23:38:09] Alice Lafferty: What do they have to offer now? Tourism... it's not like they have a lot of financial services to fall back on like the EU and US
[01/11/2022, 23:38:19] Alex Regueiro: I mean, they kind of are, but again, the fragility of the whole thing
[01/11/2022, 23:38:42] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe they do?
[01/11/2022, 23:38:42] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Single-sector economy. I don't see this as proper diversification either.
[01/11/2022, 23:38:57] Alex Regueiro: Maybe, but you'd thing their aims would be more modest and cautious in such case, no?
[01/11/2022, 23:39:14] Alice Lafferty: Isn't this true for everyone?
[01/11/2022, 23:39:25] Alex Regueiro: Coming back to neoliberalism though, what I really criticise the US and especially the GB and EU for is massive deindustrialisation.
[01/11/2022, 23:39:52] Alex Regueiro: Not countries that can mine it, or countries that don't have vast infrastructure projects
[01/11/2022, 23:40:36] Alex Regueiro: And I say this whilst utterly loathing industrial society and in particular environments
[01/11/2022, 23:41:40] Alice Lafferty: Hmm interesting. You resent our reliance on China?
[01/11/2022, 23:41:58] Alice Lafferty: Or unemployment?
[01/11/2022, 23:42:10] Alice Lafferty: Or is it a self-sufficiency thing on principle?
[01/11/2022, 23:42:12] Alex Regueiro: Not so much resent, but fear. We're overly dependent.
[01/11/2022, 23:42:45] Alice Lafferty: Yes.
[01/11/2022, 23:42:49] Alex Regueiro: Again, I don't think we should manufacture things like medicines or fertiliser there. We have the expertise and ability to do it perfectly well here. Or at least had it.
[01/11/2022, 23:43:18] Alice Lafferty: Semiconductors is the product that springs to mind.
[01/11/2022, 23:43:20] Alex Regueiro: We need to bite the bullet with higher costs. It will come sooner or later anyway (even if a major economic/military war with China doesn't come)
[01/11/2022, 23:43:22] Alex Regueiro: right
[01/11/2022, 23:43:26] Alex Regueiro: very much those tooo
[01/11/2022, 23:43:48] Alice Lafferty: For having a fragile mono geographic supply.
[01/11/2022, 23:43:55] Alex Regueiro: I have no problem with us buying cheap plastic knick-knacks from China, or even clothing to some extent.
[01/11/2022, 23:44:00] Alice Lafferty: That's just one example.
[01/11/2022, 23:44:57] Alice Lafferty: To be honest I didn't know that we *didn't manufacture stuff like fertiliser here.
[01/11/2022, 23:45:37] Alex Regueiro: So in summary, I'm fundamentally pro free-market and capitalist in many respects, but with the caveat of strong regulations and oversight, not only for making us much more robust and resilient, but for antitrust reasons and cultural ones too
[01/11/2022, 23:45:39] Alice Lafferty: I bet a lot of the patents are held by British companies still.
[01/11/2022, 23:45:43] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe American
[01/11/2022, 23:45:51] Alex Regueiro: It's a little-known scandal, to be honest
[01/11/2022, 23:46:30] Alex Regueiro: Probably. But the Chinese stole the intellectual property / knowhow long ago in most cases. Some was freely shared, but the way they caught up so quickly was a lot thanks to industrial espionage.
[01/11/2022, 23:47:14] Alice Lafferty: This does make you sound very much like a Keynesian. I broadly agree actually. I think capitalism with moderate regulation & a welfare safety net is 'the best we can do'.
[01/11/2022, 23:47:27] Alice Lafferty: Like I said not particularly radical or glamarous.
[01/11/2022, 23:47:37] Alice Lafferty: *glamorous
[01/11/2022, 23:48:00] Alex Regueiro: When I talk about partial self-sufficiency, fragility, dependence, etc. I honestly have countries like Germany and the Netherlands more in mind than Britain, though I don't think we're doing too well either.
[01/11/2022, 23:48:17] Alice Lafferty: We have a bit of that residual island mentality maybe
[01/11/2022, 23:48:25] Alex Regueiro: They're bother committing economic/national seppuku as far as I'm concerned.
[01/11/2022, 23:48:39] Alex Regueiro: Hah maybe. Some of which is good I think, though not all of course
[01/11/2022, 23:49:48] Alice Lafferty: ? I'm not familiar with the economy of the EU. As far as I could tell Germany was trying position a kind of European bloc.
[01/11/2022, 23:49:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. We haven't really touched on sociocultural issues directly, but as far as economics I'm basically there. Even though a lot of the stuff on the Austrian School & Friedman I've read makes sense with provisos.
[01/11/2022, 23:50:19] Alice Lafferty: 'Ever closer union' etc. why do you think they're suicidal?
[01/11/2022, 23:51:11] Alice Lafferty: I think you gave quite a good impression of your stance on social issues yesterday. But obviously more can always be said.
[01/11/2022, 23:51:22] Alex Regueiro: I'm referring mainly to their enormous reliance on Russian gas and Merkel's decision to quickly close down all coal and nuclear plants. "Irresponsible" doesn't due that idiocy justice. I'd call it a mortal sin of national/continental proportions if I were religious.
[01/11/2022, 23:51:36] Alex Regueiro: And Netherlands with the farming
[01/11/2022, 23:51:39] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes, that was hilarious
[01/11/2022, 23:51:40] Alex Regueiro: shameful
[01/11/2022, 23:52:29] Alice Lafferty: We will make ourselves reliant on a belligerent state because? Cheap gas?
[01/11/2022, 23:52:32] Alex Regueiro: All for the sake of appeasing the EU bureaucrats and their now fanatical environmentalist policies, the Green Parties in their country, and the general zeitgeist of the elites.
[01/11/2022, 23:52:50] Alice Lafferty: I can guess which way you voted in the referendum?
[01/11/2022, 23:52:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. And then try to sanction and oppose them at the same time. Good luck with that.
[01/11/2022, 23:53:14] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah you know me well enough now it's not hard. Even from that comment alone.
[01/11/2022, 23:54:08] Alice Lafferty: Hm, aside from that, I thought Germany looked in ok shape.
[01/11/2022, 23:54:10] Alex Regueiro: And again, to be clear, I believe climate change is happening (and it's probably human-caused for the most part). And we need to deal with it. But I don't agree with lots of current Western policies.
[01/11/2022, 23:54:51] Alex Regueiro: Their manufacturing industry has always been declining (wilfully) as far as I understand. Risky.
[01/11/2022, 23:55:17] Alice Lafferty: I'm not even sure if we should start talking about this over text. It's too complex a subject.
[01/11/2022, 23:55:23] Alex Regueiro: You were only 17 or something when the EU vote happened, right?
[01/11/2022, 23:55:41] Alex Regueiro: Yep, let's just not. Save it for another time. üôÇ
[01/11/2022, 23:55:44] Alice Lafferty: 13 haha
[01/11/2022, 23:55:58] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe 14
[01/11/2022, 23:56:01] Alex Regueiro: üò≥
[01/11/2022, 23:56:06] Alex Regueiro: Can't believe it was that long ago
[01/11/2022, 23:56:07] Alex Regueiro: wow
[01/11/2022, 23:56:10] Alice Lafferty: It was 6 years ago
[01/11/2022, 23:56:19] Alex Regueiro: I still feel like a 25 year old haha
[01/11/2022, 23:56:24] Alex Regueiro: in some ways
[01/11/2022, 23:56:43] Alice Lafferty: Even I struggle to believe '2016' was that long ago.
[01/11/2022, 23:56:57] Alice Lafferty: I catch myself thinking it's still 2019 or something.
[01/11/2022, 23:57:02] Alex Regueiro: The pandemic/lockdown years were a real blur. Two of them almost.
[01/11/2022, 23:57:11] Alex Regueiro: I turned 30 over lockdown. Sad times.
[01/11/2022, 23:57:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes I think lots of people remain as young adults in their heads.
[01/11/2022, 23:57:18] Alex Regueiro: yep
[01/11/2022, 23:57:31] Alice Lafferty: That's nothing, I turned 18 :(
[01/11/2022, 23:57:47] Alice Lafferty: My 18th birthday was May 9th 2020.
[01/11/2022, 23:57:56] Alex Regueiro: You had A-levels over lockdown, as you mentioned... I both pity and envy that.
[01/11/2022, 23:58:14] Alex Regueiro: Poor soul
[01/11/2022, 23:58:16] Alice Lafferty: Eh I'm not complaining about that. I didn't have to sit exams.
[01/11/2022, 23:58:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's the "envy" bit. You missed out on a few nice things. But nothing dire.
[01/11/2022, 23:58:53] Alex Regueiro: Did you begin Cambridge under lockdown?
[01/11/2022, 23:59:06] Alice Lafferty: No, since I took a gap year.
[01/11/2022, 23:59:19] Alice Lafferty: It was all basically over by autumn 2021.
[01/11/2022, 23:59:22] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, of course.
[01/11/2022, 23:59:33] Alex Regueiro: I had one online exam at Bristol, right at the end of lockdown. All the rest was essays. Not too bad.
[01/11/2022, 23:59:57] Alex Regueiro: Hadn't done an exam since 2011! Since my first master's didn't have them per se
[02/11/2022, 00:00:38] Alice Lafferty: You also used Michaelmas/Lent/Easter terms at Oxford?
[02/11/2022, 00:00:51] Alex Regueiro: Yep, just when I finished, lucky me.
[02/11/2022, 00:01:09] Alex Regueiro: Michaelmas/Hilary/Trinity
[02/11/2022, 00:01:26] Alice Lafferty: Nice.
[02/11/2022, 00:01:27] Alex Regueiro: Just two teaching terms as I recall
[02/11/2022, 00:01:45] Alice Lafferty: Your physics & phil degree sounds so interesting.
[02/11/2022, 00:01:55] Alex Regueiro: It was. Such a nice course structure/content, which I can tell you about some time. (Still was very far from easy though.)
[02/11/2022, 00:01:57] Alice Lafferty: Did you have to write some kind of dissertation?
[02/11/2022, 00:02:44] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's what I was telling about at the pub. On the Physical Church-Turing Thesis. I started but didn't finish it, for a few reasons. So I graduated with a lesser degree, basically.
[02/11/2022, 00:02:59] Alice Lafferty: üëé
[02/11/2022, 00:03:17] Alice Lafferty: Yes that's right.
[02/11/2022, 00:03:36] Alex Regueiro: I like it because it sounds even more old-fashioned!
[02/11/2022, 00:03:43] Alex Regueiro: But then again, the Other Place is inferior in all ways.
[02/11/2022, 00:03:53] Alex Regueiro: And it shall not be debated
[02/11/2022, 00:04:07] Alice Lafferty: ;(
[02/11/2022, 00:04:20] Alice Lafferty: And where was it that Isaac Newton studied...?
[02/11/2022, 00:05:58] Alex Regueiro: üôà
[02/11/2022, 00:06:36] Alex Regueiro: To be fair I grew up closer to Cambridge and we always went their on day trips, not Oxford. And I applied there. And had more friends there until I went to Oxford myself.
[02/11/2022, 00:06:44] Alice Lafferty: And I think Turing for that matter.
[02/11/2022, 00:07:12] Alex Regueiro: As I think I mentioned, I made the wrong choice at undergrad level. My school didn't help
[02/11/2022, 00:07:38] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, opposite is true for me. My dad went to Oxford, cousins live there, visited there a lot as a child, groomed to go there you may say...
[02/11/2022, 00:07:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Cambridge by and large has the much superior history in mathematics and the sciences, from the time of Newton until my birth (purely coincidental!), after which it's much closer
[02/11/2022, 00:07:54] Alice Lafferty: That was my small act of teenage rebellion.
[02/11/2022, 00:08:01] Alex Regueiro: Ha
[02/11/2022, 00:08:23] Alex Regueiro: I forget, but there are a couple of really famous Cambridge alumni born in Oxford.
[02/11/2022, 00:08:28] Alice Lafferty: Yes, you did your first bachelors at Imperial right?
[02/11/2022, 00:08:30] Alex Regueiro: probably vice versa too
[02/11/2022, 00:09:12] Alex Regueiro: yep
[02/11/2022, 00:09:26] Alex Regueiro: ghastly campus and social life, but good in other ways I suppose
[02/11/2022, 00:09:42] Alice Lafferty: Really, I'd have thought the social life was much better in London.
[02/11/2022, 00:10:00] Alice Lafferty: I was desperate to move away, so I didn't even apply to any of the London colleges.
[02/11/2022, 00:10:14] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes. Andrew Wiles is from Cambridge, and his dad was a divinity professor there. But he did his undergrad and master's at Oxford. Then went to Cambridge, then came back to Oxford a few years ago. Now the mathematics department (the new one that opened just after I left) is named after him.
[02/11/2022, 00:10:14] Alice Lafferty: It has an excellent science/maths reputation.
[02/11/2022, 00:10:31] Alice Lafferty: They're even altering 'oxbridge' to 'oxbrimp' to include it. P
[02/11/2022, 00:10:50] Alice Lafferty: Although I'm not sure how widely used that is yet.
[02/11/2022, 00:11:08] Alex Regueiro: He used to slide into the SCR like a wraith, get his coffee, and disappear. I also used to pass him and his wife having a Sunday morning stroll, as I went to play football.
[02/11/2022, 00:11:31] Alice Lafferty: You were taught by him?? Even I've heard of him.
[02/11/2022, 00:11:33] Alex Regueiro: Hah, I haven't heard that! Must be really new
[02/11/2022, 00:11:46] Alice Lafferty: He won a 'something' medal...
[02/11/2022, 00:12:26] Alice Lafferty: You can tell me I'm sure. My teacher described it as the Nobel prize of maths.
[02/11/2022, 00:12:38] Alex Regueiro: Nope. We just saw him around. He'd rejoined Oxford just a year before I went. Back and forth a bit between there and Princeton
[02/11/2022, 00:13:06] Alex Regueiro: Abel Prize. Too old for the Fields Medal. Debatable which is more prestigious!
[02/11/2022, 00:13:51] Alice Lafferty: Oh right.
[02/11/2022, 00:14:07] Alice Lafferty: I imagine he's pretty eccentric.
[02/11/2022, 00:14:50] Alex Regueiro: Wise choice. In hindsight I should have a) applied to Oxford, b) chosen Bristol over Imperial for my undergrad. London has a good social life in general, but the Imperial campus is a bit of a monstrosity. The joke about the physics building (right across from the Royal Albert Hall) is that they had a blank check and yet built some 50s brutalist horror.
[02/11/2022, 00:15:23] Alice Lafferty: Yes that's often the way.
[02/11/2022, 00:15:27] Alex Regueiro: Very, though I've never talked to him. Had more interactions with Penrose (Cambridge educated, but Oxford professor).
[02/11/2022, 00:15:48] Alex Regueiro: And way too expensive to live near after first year in halls
[02/11/2022, 00:15:53] Alice Lafferty: Oxford and Cambridge have some hideous buildings hidden away though too.
[02/11/2022, 00:17:08] Alice Lafferty: Oh well. I don't think your choices have done you too badly. You preferred Bristol?
[02/11/2022, 00:17:35] Alex Regueiro: So, in truth, I have huge respect for Cambridge. I mainly jest. My only real preference for Oxford is because I attended and because it's somewhat less affected by the neo-Marxist / progressive / woke / whatever you want to call it sort of bilge.
[02/11/2022, 00:18:08] Alex Regueiro: Really nice city and has a proper campus. Good student life all the same. Bristol invariably comes bottom or second-to-bottom in student satisfaction surveys.
[02/11/2022, 00:18:30] Alex Regueiro: They do, but you mainly have to go out of your way, I'd say. At least in Oxford.
[02/11/2022, 00:18:45] Alice Lafferty: I know, it would be a disgrace to tradition for me not to make fun of GDBO
[02/11/2022, 00:19:00] Alex Regueiro: I could also live in Oxford much easier. Though Cambridge is a nice town (overgrown village, I sometimes say)
[02/11/2022, 00:19:16] Alex Regueiro: hah
[02/11/2022, 00:19:20] Alice Lafferty: You mean *thunder clap*  'post-modern neo-marxism'???
[02/11/2022, 00:19:43] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I just tried to put that in asteriks and it put it in bold.
[02/11/2022, 00:19:48] Alice Lafferty: Unhappy about that.
[02/11/2022, 00:20:09] Alex Regueiro: Yes. I don't totally buy Peterson's term but the Neo-Marxist part is largely fair. At least in describing its roots, and ignoring the fact so much of it has been co-opted into mainstream progressive-liberalism now!
[02/11/2022, 00:21:16] Alice Lafferty: Unless you live in one. Look up Hills Road Homerton.
[02/11/2022, 00:21:29] Alex Regueiro: I read a great article on "cultural marxism" a few months back (its history, philosophy, and why it's a perfectly valid term, well-represented in academia even). Actually on a Christian academic journal website. Only the last little section was about religion though.
[02/11/2022, 00:21:55] Alex Regueiro: WhatsApp being too clever for its own good, as usual
[02/11/2022, 00:22:19] Alex Regueiro: Ah dear. I was lucky enough to live on collage, albeit a fairly modern one.
[02/11/2022, 00:22:24] Alex Regueiro: Still lovely
[02/11/2022, 00:22:47] Alice Lafferty: Send it to me to read?
[02/11/2022, 00:23:01] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry if you didn't save it.
[02/11/2022, 00:23:58] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to start describing myself as 'the last classic liberal in the West'.
[02/11/2022, 00:24:00] Alex Regueiro: I'll find it, because I linked a friend to it
[02/11/2022, 00:25:12] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Precious few are the "liberals" who haven't been swept up in the Great Leap Leftwards. I went through my classical liberal stage but I'm much more of a conservative liberal a la Burke now, and even that maybe isn't 100% fair.
[02/11/2022, 00:25:44] Alex Regueiro: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/cultural-marxism-imaginary-conspiracy-or-revolutionary-reality/
[02/11/2022, 00:25:59] Alice Lafferty: Thanks
[02/11/2022, 00:26:23] Alice Lafferty: Religious outlets are doing a lot of the heavy lifting in cultural criticism at the moment.
[02/11/2022, 00:26:32] Alice Lafferty: Funnily enough.
[02/11/2022, 00:26:36] Alex Regueiro: My Jamaican friend from Oxford quite liked it, and he's a weird mix of liberal and conservative. Also a recent convert from Anglicanism to Catholicism.
[02/11/2022, 00:27:20] Alex Regueiro: Agreed. I honestly think a lot of their critiques are stronger than purely classical liberal ones, which can lack a 'positive' moral framework. But you bollocks from that sphere too...
[02/11/2022, 00:27:29] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to read it now. Tomorrow we should clear up which concert we're going to see.
[02/11/2022, 00:28:24] Alex Regueiro: Oh I meant to ask you that 1/2 hour ago. Shall I just go ahead and book the SJSS one?
[02/11/2022, 00:29:18] Alex Regueiro: But tomorrow is fine to decide, it's not going to sell out. Happy reading, and good night.
[02/11/2022, 08:01:20] Alice Lafferty: The article was very interesting but its thesis is fundamentally wrong: 

'...Otherwise put, culture is not downstream from economics, but economics is downstream from culture' - the opposite is true. Ideology (culture) always arises out of necessity from a material substrate, not the other way round. The sexual revolution didn't happen 'because feminism', it happened because of the invention of domestic labour-saving devices and the contraceptive pill. But ofc from a Christian publication you can't expect anything other than vulgar idealism.
[02/11/2022, 08:02:30] Alice Lafferty: Burke is fairly high in my books. I just find him sometimes overly-sentimental.
[02/11/2022, 08:08:34] Alice Lafferty: Kind of like G.K Chesterton.
[02/11/2022, 08:09:09] Alice Lafferty: I don't mind. Wigmore Hall also looks nice. Seems like Brahms is on the menu at both.
[02/11/2022, 08:10:32] Alice Lafferty: Wait for me so that we can book seats next to each other.
[02/11/2022, 08:10:52] Alice Lafferty: Are you a 'friend' of SJSS?
[02/11/2022, 15:19:26] Alex Regueiro: Hah how very Marxist (dialectical materialist) of you!
[02/11/2022, 15:19:44] Alex Regueiro: I personally agree with the article. i.e. Gramsci was more right than Marx
[02/11/2022, 15:19:52] Alex Regueiro: even if he spawned all sorts of horrors
[02/11/2022, 15:20:44] Alex Regueiro: Both Marx and Gramsci admitted there was some influence directed in the opposite way to the primary one, in fairness. But I'm definitely more with the latter.
[02/11/2022, 15:21:20] Alex Regueiro: I haven't read him, and I've only read excerpts and secondary sources on Burke really, but that sounds fair.
[02/11/2022, 15:21:35] Alex Regueiro: Partly his 18th C sensibility, perhaps? Not sure
[02/11/2022, 15:22:32] Alex Regueiro: Anyway I thought the article was an excellent historical-philosophical overview, and very well-sourced. Nothing particularly novel in it though.
[02/11/2022, 15:22:52] Alex Regueiro: I'm a "Young Friend"
[02/11/2022, 15:23:48] Alex Regueiro: So we can both get ¬£5 tickets if you fancy!
[02/11/2022, 15:24:33] Alex Regueiro: But your ticket for Wigmore would be free too
[02/11/2022, 15:59:36] Alice Lafferty: ü§î then what do you think causes certain cultural phenomena to occur? Why did the sexual revolution happen in the 1960's and not the 1860's of the 2060's?
[02/11/2022, 16:02:00] Alice Lafferty: I thought so too.
[02/11/2022, 16:02:43] Alice Lafferty: Ok nice. How can these venues afford to sell tickets so cheaply?
[02/11/2022, 16:03:29] Alice Lafferty: I have always wanted to go to SJSS but I ultimately don't mind.
[02/11/2022, 16:04:45] Alex Regueiro: I wonder the same, especially post lockdown. Possibly because they rarely sell out. Hooking younger fans of classical may pay dividends long-term, too?
[02/11/2022, 16:04:55] Alex Regueiro: Great, I'll book that then. üôÇ
[02/11/2022, 16:06:00] Alex Regueiro: I'll get both our tickets. It's only ¬£5, and we can can always balance the books later eh.
[02/11/2022, 16:07:11] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I will bring a ¬£5 note. If you still use cash
[02/11/2022, 16:08:18] Alex Regueiro: I do, just about. Part of me is looking forward to a cashless society, part of me is a tad sceptical.
[02/11/2022, 16:09:15] Alex Regueiro: Would you like to get something to eat too, given the timing? Alternatively could just get a drink and snack (they do nice mini ice creams) at the venue.
[02/11/2022, 16:09:50] Alice Lafferty: The mini ice creams will probably clean us out
[02/11/2022, 16:10:32] Alice Lafferty: I also saw they're doing this Q&A beforehand, is that worth going to?
[02/11/2022, 16:11:15] Alice Lafferty: I don't really mind.
[02/11/2022, 16:11:54] Alice Lafferty: If you know a particular restaurant nearby? If not, we can just get a drink or something
[02/11/2022, 16:13:43] Alex Regueiro: Oh I missed that. It's about the new piece. I leave that up to you. Could listen to a bit of her stuff in advance if you fancy, and if it appeals then yes? Otherwise no.
[02/11/2022, 16:24:23] Alex Regueiro: So many places close early these days. There's a decent but overpriced Italian place nearby, but the better option is probably Ma La Sichuan. Have been meaning to try it for a while. Well-rated and more affordable.
[02/11/2022, 16:28:30] Alex Regueiro: In truth I think there's a constant interplay between the two, and sometimes one is more important than the other. I know, such a boring middle-ground take. With that example I think it was a very natural progression of liberal and individualist ideals from the Enlightenment, but clearly WWII played a role both socially and economically.
[02/11/2022, 16:30:41] Alice Lafferty: Ok. We can decide at the time or will we have to book?
[02/11/2022, 16:32:38] Alice Lafferty: Well, then I will ask you why the individualist ideals and Enlightenment arose when they did and so on and so on.
[02/11/2022, 16:33:27] Alice Lafferty: I agree that they influence each other reciprocally.
[02/11/2022, 16:33:54] Alice Lafferty: A Marxist would say material 'base' and cultural 'superstructure' but you don't even have to use those terms.
[02/11/2022, 16:34:18] Alice Lafferty: But the superstructure is vastly more influential.
[02/11/2022, 16:34:41] Alice Lafferty: 'Ideology' comes about post hoc to rationalise changes wrought by technology.
[02/11/2022, 16:34:50] Alice Lafferty: That's my opinion anyway.
[02/11/2022, 16:36:12] Alex Regueiro: I knew that was coming heh. I'll concede the "time was right" economically, but also socially. And some ideologies need a great thinker; they're not quite inevitable. Marxism for example was a outgrowth of the industrial revolution and the new working and middle classes, in some ways, but it still needed the intellects of Marx (and Engels). That's even more apparent with science and technology I think.
[02/11/2022, 16:36:17] Alex Regueiro: Cue "great man of history" debate
[02/11/2022, 16:36:32] Alice Lafferty: I was just about to mention
[02/11/2022, 16:37:13] Alex Regueiro: Right. That's obviously what I was thinking before. That's exactly what Gramsci inverted. Although I side more with him, I'm not sure it's ever quite so simple
[02/11/2022, 16:37:43] Alex Regueiro: A bit risky leaving until the night I'd say. Shall I book now and we can cancel last minute if you don't feel up for it?
[02/11/2022, 16:37:57] Alice Lafferty: If Marx and Engels themselves hadn't existed, I'm confident someone else would have devised a 'proletariat revolution' style ideology, even though it would have for sure differed superficially.
[02/11/2022, 16:38:18] Alex Regueiro: I kind of hate planning meals in advance, but such is the norm in our country...
[02/11/2022, 16:38:37] Alice Lafferty: Won't they charge if you cancel last minute?
[02/11/2022, 16:39:48] Alice Lafferty: I find this difficult because I don't believe individuals have that much impact on society.
[02/11/2022, 16:39:59] Alex Regueiro: Certain innovations require really powerful/impressive minds and characters though. This may have been one of those cases. As in, without them, the similar-but-alternative ideas and their promulgation could have been much less inspiring to people.
[02/11/2022, 16:40:34] Alice Lafferty: Hm, there are tons of hack writers about.
[02/11/2022, 16:40:53] Alice Lafferty: Plus, most of the participants in Communist revolutions had never even read Marx.
[02/11/2022, 16:41:04] Alex Regueiro: I'm sceptical of only applying the Great Man theory, but I think very apposite when you look at cases like Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, etc.
[02/11/2022, 16:41:17] Alice Lafferty: They were illiterate peasants! Marx isn't the point.
[02/11/2022, 16:42:06] Alex Regueiro: Kind of. They were roped into it. But it was precisely the haute bourgeoisie that spearheaded the early Marxist movements. The vanguard, as they say.
[02/11/2022, 16:42:25] Alex Regueiro: (i.e. bloody intellectuals)
[02/11/2022, 16:43:02] Alex Regueiro: And in science, men like Galileo, Newton, Einstein... Honestly some of their inventions might not have arrived until much much later or in considerably different form had they not existed
[02/11/2022, 16:43:56] Alice Lafferty: Non-entities without the wider advantages specific to Greek/Roman/French societies and militaries.
[02/11/2022, 16:44:24] Alice Lafferty: There I agree with you. But it's not the inventors themselves, it's the inventions.
[02/11/2022, 16:44:39] Alice Lafferty: Inventions can 'pass into the world' through any person with sufficient intelligence.
[02/11/2022, 16:44:44] Alex Regueiro: I don't disagree there, but it's very easy to imagine an alternative history where these forces of nature weren't born and things unfolded in a different way
[02/11/2022, 16:45:30] Alice Lafferty: It's like how (almost) every civilisation in the world invented lunar calendars and agriculture and pythagorean triples...
[02/11/2022, 16:45:35] Alex Regueiro: Right, but it fundamentally these great ideas and theories don't appear out of some Platonic aether. It takes utter geniuses *and* the right circumstances and a bit of luck for them to change the world.
[02/11/2022, 16:46:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes, the right *material* circumstancesüòâ
[02/11/2022, 16:46:21] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever read Jared Diamond
[02/11/2022, 16:46:42] Alex Regueiro: That's a bit different though. Something like the theory of universal gravitation or the laws of mechanics were far from obvious at the time, and might have taken another century without a Newton!
[02/11/2022, 16:47:11] Alex Regueiro: the Guns and Steel book or whatever it is?
[02/11/2022, 16:47:15] Alex Regueiro: No, but heard plenty about it
[02/11/2022, 16:47:19] Alex Regueiro: haha
[02/11/2022, 16:47:20] Alice Lafferty: More complex science and engineering only occured in Europe because we developed an agricultural surplus (material conditions again)
[02/11/2022, 16:47:33] Alice Lafferty: Exactly that.
[02/11/2022, 16:47:34] Alex Regueiro: I find it a nice argument but not 100% convincing
[02/11/2022, 16:47:45] Alice Lafferty: Which part is not convincing?
[02/11/2022, 16:48:19] Alice Lafferty: Ok and you can combine it a bit with much earlier evolutionary pathways meaning slightly bigger brains etc.
[02/11/2022, 16:49:29] Alex Regueiro: I don't know the details of his argument really, but a) so much was due to the vagaries of history, b) genetic factors and natural selection played at least a minor role.
[02/11/2022, 16:50:03] Alice Lafferty: Don't be so sure: https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/leading-figures/hooke-the-genius-whose-big-mistake-was-confronting-newton/amp/
[02/11/2022, 16:50:19] Alex Regueiro: I certainly agree that the geography and climate of certain places were highly influential in developing civilisations, however
[02/11/2022, 16:51:00] Alex Regueiro: Nah, I've read about this. Hooke was impressive and traditionally not given his due in the history of science, but he was nowhere near the towering genius of Newton.
[02/11/2022, 16:51:38] Alice Lafferty: I kind of consider things like raw intelligence to be non-cultural. Anything that isn't a deliberate act of a human I think is material.
[02/11/2022, 16:52:07] Alex Regueiro: I have a definite distaste for the purely deterministic macroscopic conception of history and progress, however. That's the upshot.
[02/11/2022, 16:52:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh do you think? Honestly I don't know. I just read once that a guy called Hooke had concurrently come up with a theory of gravitation.
[02/11/2022, 16:53:31] Alice Lafferty: Could be an oversimplification.
[02/11/2022, 16:54:07] Alex Regueiro: Without the right material and cultural circumstances for such intelligence to flourish, it would have been (and often surely was) inconsequerntial
[02/11/2022, 16:55:04] Alex Regueiro: So, from what I recall, he had some good ideas about gravitation and they may even have influenced Newton a bit, but fell well short of Newton's theory.
[02/11/2022, 16:55:18] Alice Lafferty: I mean, there's an element of chance definitely. But the prior conditions of a state make certain outcomes statistically much more probable.
[02/11/2022, 16:55:19] Alex Regueiro: I think the In Our Time episode on Hooke covers this well üôÇ
[02/11/2022, 16:55:48] Alex Regueiro: Yes you won't get any argument there
[02/11/2022, 16:55:53] Alice Lafferty: All science is collaborative to a certain extent?
[02/11/2022, 16:55:57] Alex Regueiro: I still veer away from total determinism though
[02/11/2022, 16:56:33] Alex Regueiro: To a certain extent, but it's much more so now in our interconnected world. There were plenty of overwhelmingly solitary geniuses in the past, Newton being one of them for the most part.
[02/11/2022, 16:56:46] Alex Regueiro: But I could name several mathematicians of that sort too
[02/11/2022, 16:57:32] Alice Lafferty: What I'm trying to get at is that at bottom a combination of geographical factors and random genetic mutations in populations influence history. I don't believe that some figures sometimes drive things forward with some kind of transcendental 'will'.
[02/11/2022, 16:58:55] Alice Lafferty: At a certain point (like 99.999999%) don't some probabilities become functionally deterministic.
[02/11/2022, 16:59:09] Alex Regueiro: This is interesting, by the way: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory#William_James'_defence
[02/11/2022, 17:00:06] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much, but I don't think the milieu in which Newton was born (less keep using his example) remotely guaranteed a man of such immense intellectual calibre or influence.
[02/11/2022, 17:01:44] Alex Regueiro: The very fact that history is so damn difficult to predict is testament to the lack of determinism, material or otherwise. (I love Asimov's Foundation series and psychohistory, but it's not remotely plausible.)
[02/11/2022, 17:02:18] Alex Regueiro: Mathematically, historical progress of societies and civilisations is a chaotic system, in a well-defined sense.
[02/11/2022, 17:02:42] Alice Lafferty: Hm it didn't convince me unfortunately. I disagree that 'certain ideas can only flash out of just one brain'.
[02/11/2022, 17:03:26] Alice Lafferty: Yes predictability is a sticking point.
[02/11/2022, 17:03:31] Alice Lafferty: Esp in economics.
[02/11/2022, 17:03:58] Alex Regueiro: Do you agree we're all fundamentally unique and idiosyncratic in many ways? Some more so than others, but it's clearly inherent to humanity / life in general, to me.
[02/11/2022, 17:04:29] Alex Regueiro: Equally in culture or intellectual spheres, I'd say, but yeah economics for sure
[02/11/2022, 17:04:40] Alice Lafferty: 'vital importance of individual initiative' - this stuff about the human will seems like mysticism to me.
[02/11/2022, 17:06:11] Alice Lafferty: Yes, but hardly in a statistically significant way. I actually more so believe that it's useful to think about the entirety of humanity as some kind of emergent super-organism.
[02/11/2022, 17:06:34] Alex Regueiro: I think what James was getting at, and putting eloquently but quite possibly too sentimentally, aligns with my discussion of chaos theory and the breakdown of causality, which to be fair to him came decades after his life.
[02/11/2022, 17:07:26] Alex Regueiro: Society / humanity is an organism at some level, but... well, I'd like to invoke 'integrated information theory' here, but I won't because I don't properly understand it.
[02/11/2022, 17:07:58] Alice Lafferty: Some elements end up playing a more pivotal role, but that's largely a matter of chance and the person themselves is nothing if not part of the whole.
[02/11/2022, 17:07:59] Alex Regueiro: Shall we continue this discussion in person? This is getting increasingly difficult heh. There are so many nuances, and I think the nuances is where we're diverging really.
[02/11/2022, 17:08:50] Alice Lafferty: I thought chaos theory doesn't apply on large scale systems like humans.
[02/11/2022, 17:09:15] Alex Regueiro: You can say the only whole at the end of the day is the universe in its totality. But that's such a cop-out. Just like you can invoke postmodernist tenets everywhere and refuse to reduce and analyse concepts and individual entities in "isolation", it doesn't get you anywhere.
[02/11/2022, 17:09:17] Alice Lafferty: Ok! I don't know either.
[02/11/2022, 17:09:29] Alex Regueiro: On the contrary, it applies even better!
[02/11/2022, 17:09:45] Alice Lafferty: Ok! I probably won't be any clearer in person I'm afraid.
[02/11/2022, 17:10:33] Alice Lafferty: I see, I didn't know that. I thought it was some kind of particle physics thing.
[02/11/2022, 17:10:39] Alex Regueiro: It's all good. You've expressed yourself pretty well here in any case. Let's mull over it and pick it up again soon. üòâ
[02/11/2022, 17:11:25] Alex Regueiro: It's an easy misconception to make. I'll try to elaborate in person, to the best of my abilities, though I haven't studied it formally.
[02/11/2022, 17:11:41] Alice Lafferty: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory 
How funny this basically cycles back round to the problem of consciousness.
[02/11/2022, 17:11:41] Alex Regueiro: By the way, did you answer about the restaurant? I might have missed it in the back and forth.
[02/11/2022, 17:13:09] Alex Regueiro: Yep! That's where it originated. I don't think it fully explains consciousness by any stretch, but it's an interesting theory regardless.
[02/11/2022, 17:13:12] Alice Lafferty: I said earlier that they will charge us if we cancel last minute.
[02/11/2022, 17:13:16] Alice Lafferty: What time does the concert end?
[02/11/2022, 17:13:21] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, sorry
[02/11/2022, 17:13:30] Alex Regueiro: I think we'll be fine. Haven't had that happen to me in years
[02/11/2022, 17:13:49] Alex Regueiro: Doubt they even have a reservation fee.
[02/11/2022, 17:13:55] Alice Lafferty: Really? If you want to risk it
[02/11/2022, 17:14:11] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I'm thinking of when you book online and they take your card details.
[02/11/2022, 17:14:34] Alex Regueiro: Don't think it's too long, so maybe 9 or 9:15?
[02/11/2022, 17:15:21] Alice Lafferty: Ok you can explain it to me and how it supports your theory.
[02/11/2022, 17:16:25] Alex Regueiro: Would you prefer to eat before or after, if we do?
[02/11/2022, 17:16:45] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Maybe book it and then see if we feel tired/hungry at the time.
[02/11/2022, 17:17:08] Alice Lafferty: Probably after? It is a bit late
[02/11/2022, 17:17:12] Alice Lafferty: I don't mind either way
[02/11/2022, 17:18:15] Alex Regueiro: It was possibly overkill invoking that, but as I understand it does quantify how "integrated" systems are and to what extent they can be decomposed into subsystems that can be treated individually without losing important emergent properties.
[02/11/2022, 17:18:30] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I'll book it and it's no big deal if we don't go.
[02/11/2022, 17:20:01] Alex Regueiro: Not open yet, but I'll try in a bit.
[02/11/2022, 17:20:19] Alice Lafferty: I may pull an uno reverse card on you and say that it better supports my position:  'In IIT, a system's consciousness (what it is like subjectively) is conjectured to be identical to its causal properties (what it is like objectively)'.
[02/11/2022, 17:20:26] Alex Regueiro: Going to head into London shortly. That discussion group I mentioned in passing before.
[02/11/2022, 17:20:39] Alex Regueiro: Or "salon" as we call it in a very pretentious Enlightenment fashion
[02/11/2022, 17:21:22] Alice Lafferty: Interesting. It seems like a mereological problem fundamentally.
[02/11/2022, 17:21:22] Alex Regueiro: You'll have to elaborate, since that's fine with me but seems sort of tangential
[02/11/2022, 17:21:34] Alex Regueiro: yep
[02/11/2022, 17:21:45] Alice Lafferty: That sounds really fun
[02/11/2022, 17:21:53] Alex Regueiro: It is üôÇ
[02/11/2022, 17:21:57] Alice Lafferty: Ok thanks
[02/11/2022, 17:21:59] Alex Regueiro: I help organise it these days in fact
[02/11/2022, 17:22:09] Alice Lafferty: How many of you are there?
[02/11/2022, 17:23:57] Alex Regueiro: I can bring you along at some point if you fancy...
[02/11/2022, 17:24:05] Alex Regueiro: It's just a bit risky/premature right now maybe haha
[02/11/2022, 17:24:23] Alex Regueiro: But I'm certainly not averse to it, if you're interested
[02/11/2022, 17:24:46] Alex Regueiro: Varies between say 5 and 15 (that's two standard deviations)
[02/11/2022, 17:25:02] Alice Lafferty: Haha I had to hold myself back from asking
[02/11/2022, 17:25:06] Alex Regueiro: More like 15 tonight, I think, since we did some recruiting
[02/11/2022, 17:25:13] Alice Lafferty: No definitely!
[02/11/2022, 17:25:53] Alex Regueiro: If we still like each other in a month or so, say? Then I'd be very happy to.
[02/11/2022, 17:25:56] Alice Lafferty: Maybe you can tell me afterwards what was discussed
[02/11/2022, 17:26:20] Alice Lafferty: And I'll give my (totally unsolicited) 2 cents like I do with everything.
[02/11/2022, 17:26:38] Alex Regueiro: Gladly. We cover all sorts of political/social/philosophical topics. Today it's the monarchy as an institution. A bit soon for some, but let's see how it goes.
[02/11/2022, 17:27:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting... have you read Curtis Yarvin?
[02/11/2022, 17:27:35] Alice Lafferty: aka 'moldbug'
[02/11/2022, 17:27:35] Alex Regueiro: Hah. But I love hearing your two cents, so it's all fine.
[02/11/2022, 17:27:36] Alex Regueiro: In general I'm usually up for a good intellectual discussion. (Unless I really don't respect the other person!)
[02/11/2022, 17:27:43] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[02/11/2022, 17:28:15] Alex Regueiro: The guy who was originally running the salon (still is in part) is a fan
[02/11/2022, 17:28:32] Alice Lafferty: Nice
[02/11/2022, 17:28:39] Alex Regueiro: My friend, I should say. He is now.
[02/11/2022, 17:28:56] Alex Regueiro: I think he's really interesting, though his style rubs me the wrong way on some things. Maybe just too brashly American.
[02/11/2022, 17:28:59] Alex Regueiro: Do you like him?
[02/11/2022, 17:29:01] Alice Lafferty: He's some type of monarchist right?
[02/11/2022, 17:29:06] Alice Lafferty: Or at least masquerades as one
[02/11/2022, 17:29:21] Alex Regueiro: I think so, though I really don't know his stuff well.
[02/11/2022, 17:30:05] Alex Regueiro: I read some of the Moldbug Manifesto, not much more
[02/11/2022, 17:30:29] Alice Lafferty: I disagree with most of his prescriptions but I do personally quite like his writing. I find that kind of freewheeling writing style enjoyable to read and he can be acually quite funny.
[02/11/2022, 17:30:55] Alex Regueiro: Yeah he was definitely amusing at times
[02/11/2022, 17:31:00] Alice Lafferty: Well, I'm sure his name will get mentioned then.
[02/11/2022, 17:31:09] Alice Lafferty: Hope you have a nice time
[02/11/2022, 17:31:08] Alex Regueiro: There's a certain overconfidence in his evaluations and prescriptions though
[02/11/2022, 17:31:29] Alex Regueiro: Thanks üòä
[02/11/2022, 17:31:56] Alex Regueiro: Or maybe just I get enough of his type, being a software engineer!
[02/11/2022, 17:32:08] Alex Regueiro: Doing anything yourself this evening?
[02/11/2022, 17:33:11] Alice Lafferty: Right all those 'effective altruism' guys were software engineers too.
[02/11/2022, 17:33:26] Alice Lafferty: No! I'm going to hang out with my parents!
[02/11/2022, 17:34:50] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good. I'm glad you seem to get on with them both well.
[02/11/2022, 17:35:15] Alex Regueiro: Was meaning to ask if they were back... but that's answered
[02/11/2022, 17:35:53] Alex Regueiro: Hah yep. I knew a guy at Oxford (more of a good acquaintance) who went on to work with Singer a lot
[03/11/2022, 18:05:58] Alex Regueiro: Afternoon
[03/11/2022, 18:06:09] Alex Regueiro: God I hate it when Summer Time ends.
[03/11/2022, 18:06:28] Alex Regueiro: How‚Äôs your day going?
[03/11/2022, 18:13:58] Alice Lafferty: Hello
[03/11/2022, 18:14:51] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I'm the opposite actually. I like it when it's dark and kind of blustery outside. I spend all year looking forward to autumn and winter.
[03/11/2022, 18:15:04] Alice Lafferty: Ok, how is your's?
[03/11/2022, 18:15:13] Alice Lafferty: How was was your 'salon' last night?
[03/11/2022, 18:20:08] Alex Regueiro: Hah no, you're quite right actually. Autumn's my favourite season in fact. The mood and aesthetic, I suppose. I just find pre-5pm sunsets a bit too much! Maybe because I'm a little nocturnal anyway.
[03/11/2022, 18:20:54] Alex Regueiro: Pretty boring in fact. Just doing some admin stuff really.
[03/11/2022, 18:22:25] Alex Regueiro: Salon was good thanks. It had been a while since our last one, so it was great to see people (and some new faces). On the other hand, we couldn't get a room to ourselves this time, so it was a bit raucaous, and got absolutely drenched coming back
[03/11/2022, 18:22:31] Alex Regueiro: raucous*
[03/11/2022, 18:23:49] Alex Regueiro: Discussion was mainly stimulating and interesting, except for one woman who kept derailing it onto imperialism/colonialism, as if that's somehow our late Queen was personally responsible (quite the opposite). üôÑ
[03/11/2022, 18:26:17] Alex Regueiro: The more interesting discussion centred around what she represented to us as a nation, across various divides, the tradition and values she preserves, the Church of England, the relationship with democracy (arguably positive!), the unity she may have brought us in life and death. It was fairly evenly split in terms of the Queen and the monarchy as an institution.
[03/11/2022, 18:54:44] Alice Lafferty: Yeah there was so much of that about after her death. Historical illiteracy was really surprising, she a) she had no political power and b) her reign actually oversaw the dismantling of the remains of Empire...?
[03/11/2022, 18:55:36] Alice Lafferty: That sounds good. Which side did you come down on?
[03/11/2022, 19:51:20] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. I got pretty frustrated with that, but thankfully we set the facts in order pretty quickly and then steered it back on topic.
[03/11/2022, 19:53:28] Alex Regueiro: I saw a few really foul comments about the Queen after her death along these lines, the tragic thing being some of it even came from academics. Staggering ignorance and lack of analytical ability.
[03/11/2022, 19:57:51] Alex Regueiro: I was actually a soft republican in the past. But I had huge admiration/respect for the Queen. I'm sort of ambivalent or undecided about King Charles. Anyway, I grew to respect the unifying role she played and the timeless apolitical traditions she embodied. Not to mention her sense of duty and stoicism. So in theory I'm a soft monarchist now, but if (God save us all) Harry somehow came to the throne I'd probably become a hardcore republican overnight! Now that Christianity and certain other traditions and commonalities that used to unite us Brits have basically disappeared, the monarchy is almost all that remains to give a sense of continuity in the face of such unstable and divisive politics these days.
[03/11/2022, 19:57:56] Alex Regueiro: Does that make sense? What's your take? üôÇ
[03/11/2022, 20:09:54] Alice Lafferty: It does, and I'm in much the same place as you. I'm a monarchist at heart but I have to admit I can't justify it politically. I can really only make emotive appeals.
[03/11/2022, 20:11:01] Alice Lafferty: It's pretty unlikely Harry will become King unless he goes full Richard III and kills all of William's children.
[03/11/2022, 20:11:14] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure about Charles.
[03/11/2022, 20:11:20] Alice Lafferty: I like his work in organic farming
[03/11/2022, 20:11:25] Alex Regueiro: Haha indeed. Just using a far-fetched possibility to make a point though
[03/11/2022, 20:12:14] Alice Lafferty: But then there's that weird town he commissioned in Devon. Poundbury?
[03/11/2022, 20:12:21] Alice Lafferty: It might be pretty interesting.
[03/11/2022, 20:12:41] Alex Regueiro: Agreed. He's a traditionalist in SOME ways. Supports British agriculture, traditional architecture, Poundbury was/is a really interesting project. His involvement with the WEF is less appealing to the average person, and they're totally fair to be sceptical of that, all the more so now he's king.
[03/11/2022, 20:12:50] Alex Regueiro: I'm holding off full judgement
[03/11/2022, 20:13:24] Alice Lafferty: Can see fireworks from my window. I just realised the concert is on Bonfire Night.
[03/11/2022, 20:13:41] Alex Regueiro: Right. Perhaps some pragmatic ones too. I think it's actually a reasonably strong argument simply to ask, however: "what alternative do we have right now, is it worth the trouble of transition, and how can we guarantee it will be better?"
[03/11/2022, 20:14:30] Alex Regueiro: Dorset, but yeah. I'm honestly pretty positive about it overall. Nothing wrong with such an experiment, in my view.
[03/11/2022, 20:14:49] Alice Lafferty: Yes, it's not a priority to me. And I hate making this argument because it's so cynical but the royal family pay for themselves many times over in tourism revenue.
[03/11/2022, 20:14:57] Alex Regueiro: Hah I know. That occurred to me last night. Doesn't particularly bother me. You okay with it?
[03/11/2022, 20:15:52] Alex Regueiro: That's true. As long as my taxes don't go towards that security detail that Harry & Megan wanted (and aren't even official royals any more), I can live with it!
[03/11/2022, 20:17:06] Alice Lafferty: Is anybody actually living there yet? I thought from images it was in danger of slipping into a kind of disneyfied Merrie England thing... maybe it will come alive people move in.
[03/11/2022, 20:18:00] Alex Regueiro: Not sure. Wikipedia suggests 3,500 are living there but it's not due for completion until 2025.
[03/11/2022, 20:18:56] Alex Regueiro: If he's funding it with his personal income/wealth, I really don't have a problem with it. The idea of challenging conventional post-war town planning (i.e. the rejection of all that is good and beautiful in this world) is a worthy one, at least.
[03/11/2022, 20:19:17] Alice Lafferty: Going to hate-read Harry's book when it comes out.
[03/11/2022, 20:19:51] Alex Regueiro: Ahh. Can you hate-read it for me and just give the executive summary please?
[03/11/2022, 20:20:29] Alice Lafferty: No, I don't mind. As I said we're strongly discouraged from doing anything on Bonfire Night anyway.
[03/11/2022, 20:21:20] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. You'll be in an Anglican church, but at least it's been deconsecrated. üòâ
[03/11/2022, 20:22:27] Alex Regueiro: I actually loathe being in the London throngs for big public celebrations. Last did New Year's Eve there maybe 8 years ago, and regretted it badly. But I doubt it will be bad where we are.
[03/11/2022, 20:22:38] Alex Regueiro: I mean, the backstreets of Westminster
[03/11/2022, 20:22:59] Alice Lafferty: What you said here reminded me that I went back and watched the Louise Perry interview you linked. I'm definitely familiar with her arguments because it's basically the line taken by the entire UnHerd-Spectator-Anglo twitter media ecosystem that's sprung up recently. They also crusade against brutalist architecture etc.
[03/11/2022, 20:23:15] Alice Lafferty: Some of them call themselves like 'post-liberals' or something?
[03/11/2022, 20:24:16] Alice Lafferty: You seem to ideologically similar to them, as far as I can tell?
[03/11/2022, 20:24:21] Alice Lafferty: Could be wrong though.
[03/11/2022, 20:24:44] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I mentioned Imperial's physics department (among other buildings on campus), so having had first-hand experience for a few years, I'm firmly in that camp.
[03/11/2022, 20:24:50] Alex Regueiro: Yep, some of them definitely do
[03/11/2022, 20:25:44] Alice Lafferty: I find being in large cities very difficult from a sensory perspective. Noise, unfamiliarity pollution etc. I rarely go into central London.
[03/11/2022, 20:26:14] Alice Lafferty: I will be ok on Saturday because I will plan the journey carefully and wear noise-cancelling headphones.
[03/11/2022, 20:26:28] Alice Lafferty: Not to the concert! But on the journey
[03/11/2022, 20:26:30] Alex Regueiro: I've never used the term to describe myself. I'm not a huge fan of labels, and even less the 1D political spectrum, but maybe I'm somewhere between a Burkean conservative liberal and post-liberal (in the sense I'm very sceptical of globalist elites and their agenda, while trying not to go full conspiracy-theory haha).
[03/11/2022, 20:27:27] Alex Regueiro: For example, I'm one of those (evil) people who looks at Meloni and doesn't see anything particularly radical or far-right with her or her party... even I'm not aligned on every single issue.
[03/11/2022, 20:28:26] Alice Lafferty: I think I'm currently somewhere around there too, but I'm still in the process of evaluating different schools of thoughts. Haven't really reached political maturation yet. Probably because you're older than me.
[03/11/2022, 20:29:17] Alex Regueiro: I firmly got that impression when we were first planning to meet up. You can take comfort at least that I'm totally in the same boat as you there. I go in out of necessity or because I can occasionally afford to bite the bullet for the sake of something cultural or a fun night out. But the sensory stimulus is so often overwhelming. Covent Garden on a Saturday night is pretty close to my idea of hell.
[03/11/2022, 20:29:19] Alice Lafferty: * i mean, you've had more time to think on it
[03/11/2022, 20:29:48] Alex Regueiro: Have you come across the term "highly sensitive person"? I generally don't like these sorts of mushy neologisms, but I think it might describe me
[03/11/2022, 20:30:52] Alice Lafferty: I have actually. To me that seems to describe people who have some autistic traits but do not meet the threshold for diagnosis. Probably a useful concept.
[03/11/2022, 20:33:07] Alex Regueiro: And that's totally fair. It's probably a credit to one's personality/openness and style of thinking not to place oneself firmly in a box at a young age. Got plenty of time for that. Relish your years as a curmudgeonly old reactionary, by all means, but no need to hurry there! üôÇ
[03/11/2022, 20:33:40] Alice Lafferty: Mine too. On one occasion I was supposed to meet someone on Oxford street, but I literally never made it out of Oxford Circus station. That was 4ish years ago. I just stopped trying after that.
[03/11/2022, 20:34:40] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I envisage it more as a subset of introverts who have to really limit their external stimuli (sensory but also other types) to operate best and not get anxious. Apparently there are some HSP extroverts though. I listened to a podcast on it by this woman, several years ago.
[03/11/2022, 20:35:01] Alice Lafferty: Same, I couldn't quite see what the fuss was about, except that her party was harbouring some authentic neo-nazis at some point.
[03/11/2022, 20:35:56] Alice Lafferty: The problem that dare not speak its name in Europe is that racially heterogenous societies are less socially cohesive.
[03/11/2022, 20:36:24] Alex Regueiro: Oh gosh, I really empathise. Not sure I've ever done that, but a few times I've gotten so overwhelmed in the hubbub and crowds of London, or even at a pub/restaurant, that I've just had to run off and find the nearest place to isolate myself for 20 or 30 minutes. I'm better at gauging my limits and mood these days, so I usually know when to call it quits ahead of time... but not always.
[03/11/2022, 20:37:09] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I mean, there were some neo-fascist links, I won't deny, but I don't think it was the core of the party of represented her own ideology/manifesto by a long way.
[03/11/2022, 20:38:02] Alex Regueiro: Hah I know. But this is such a taboo. Even though you can look at somewhere like Japan or Korea and see how enormously it helps them! I mean, other cultural phenomena help them a lot too, but I wish we didn't brush it under the rug...
[03/11/2022, 20:38:11] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. I'm now a more able to just say: 'No. I don't want to go clubbing with you. I can't think of anything worse.'
[03/11/2022, 20:39:04] Alex Regueiro: Have you been to nightclubs much? I think I last went when I was 23/24, and even by that point I'd be tailing off for years. Can't say they were EVER my scene, though I did it to fit in during my undergrad and a little afterwards.
[03/11/2022, 20:40:45] Alice Lafferty: I've never been to one. By the time I was old enough to be allowed in, I'd already realised I wouldn't enjoy it.
[03/11/2022, 20:41:07] Alex Regueiro: Then you were more honest with yourself than me at that age
[03/11/2022, 20:42:50] Alice Lafferty: Teenagers are desperate to fit in! I was kind of forced into it because things really came to a head in my late teens, not being able to cope at school, followed by autism diagnosis. Although I still maintain most of my symptoms are subclinical... but whatever.
[03/11/2022, 20:42:53] Alex Regueiro: FYI, they confirmed the restaurant booking at 9:30, but I didn't have to pay. So if you're feeling overwhelmed by London, or merely tired, it's no problem cancelling last minute.
[03/11/2022, 20:43:44] Alice Lafferty: Ok that sounds good. I suspect if anything restaurants will be quieter on Bonfire night?
[03/11/2022, 20:44:03] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah. And let's be honest, it persists well into adulthood, at least as need for some sort of acceptance or belonging to a tribe. It declines but never quite goes away. My need for it was always very low (never even had a friendship clique), but I can't pretend I was totally immune.
[03/11/2022, 20:44:16] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I reckon so
[03/11/2022, 20:44:49] Alice Lafferty: And it's rich coming from us, being ourselves products of immigration.
[03/11/2022, 20:45:04] Alex Regueiro: Hah right
[03/11/2022, 20:45:56] Alice Lafferty: Maybe the real factor at play here isn't ethnic diversity itself but failure to culturally assimilate?
[03/11/2022, 20:46:51] Alice Lafferty: How did you get on at school/university then? Not part of the party scene I guess?
[03/11/2022, 20:47:01] Alex Regueiro: But I think any accusations of hypocrisy dissolve upon closer inspection. In my view, anyone who's truly thought about the problem realises the need for cultural cohesion and the massive issues with multiculturalism. (Monoethnicity is a step further, and provides some additional benefits for sure, but not as many as the move from multiculturalism to more-or-less monoculturalism.)
[03/11/2022, 20:47:39] Alex Regueiro: Funny how the biggest exponents of monoculturalism in recent UK politics have been people like Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman!
[03/11/2022, 20:47:45] Alice Lafferty: Yes, that's the distinction which people often fail to make.
[03/11/2022, 20:48:30] Alice Lafferty: Exponent? Do you mean critic?
[03/11/2022, 20:48:38] Alice Lafferty: Oh sorry
[03/11/2022, 20:48:44] Alice Lafferty: I read 'multiculturalism'
‚Äé[03/11/2022, 20:49:42] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[03/11/2022, 20:49:58] Alex Regueiro: No worries
[03/11/2022, 20:50:19] Alice Lafferty: This is also a point where right and left concerns should converge: when Bangladesh and North Africa become uninhabitable, there will be tens of millions of migrants floating about with nowhere to go...
[03/11/2022, 20:50:57] Alice Lafferty: Maybe we can get the Shire Tories to take action on climate change if you phrase it like that.
[03/11/2022, 20:52:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes I've seen this too. In the only speech of her's I've seen, she quoted heavily from Mill and Chesterton.
[03/11/2022, 20:53:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I can't get on board with the idea of ethnostates...
[03/11/2022, 20:53:54] Alex Regueiro: I mean, like I was saying, the student life at Imperial was so awful I didn't have to do much avoiding. (In fact both the good and the bad of student social life was missing.) I tested the waters, mainly second year, but by the time I had a gap year and went to Oxford, I'd sort of woken up to the fact I was only slightly less a misfit than in secondary school. I don't think I went to a single big party in Sixth Form, and everyone knew how independent/nonconformist I was in that sense and others. Regretted it only briefly. I could tell you lots of small stories, but that's better done in person.
[03/11/2022, 20:53:56] Alex Regueiro: How about you?
[03/11/2022, 20:54:53] Alex Regueiro: If it happens naturally, that's fine, but monoculturalism (a coherent, well-defined nation state with plenty of common ground) is the real goal
[03/11/2022, 20:56:28] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah? I'm not a huge fan of Mill any more. His brand of utopian liberalism and utilitarianism is too naive for me. And rationalism, I should say. Never read Chesterton, but that certainly doesn't surprise me. I've caught a few Father Brown episodes on daytime TV, mind you. üòÄ
[03/11/2022, 20:58:42] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, my dad wanted help with screwing in a lightbulb :/
[03/11/2022, 20:59:34] Alex Regueiro: No problem
[03/11/2022, 20:59:41] Alice Lafferty: Again very similar. Very quiet at school although I was friends with some other kind of nerdyish girls so it was ok.
[03/11/2022, 21:00:36] Alex Regueiro: My height means it's a common occurrence...
[03/11/2022, 21:00:37] Alice Lafferty: Social 'overload' can be just as sapping as sensory overload, sometimes moreso.
[03/11/2022, 21:00:51] Alex Regueiro: very much so
[03/11/2022, 21:01:08] Alex Regueiro: I've experienced intellectual/cerebral overload too, but not so often
[03/11/2022, 21:01:49] Alex Regueiro: The unholy trinity of overloads
[03/11/2022, 21:01:53] Alice Lafferty: Same but she obviously has this affinity with British culture.
[03/11/2022, 21:02:20] Alice Lafferty: Explain more? Is that an information processing thing?
[03/11/2022, 21:02:20] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's fair enough
[03/11/2022, 21:05:01] Alex Regueiro: In theory yes. It's maybe one point we should be a bit more "effective altruist" about. I'm pretty cynical about just dumping aid into third-world countries. We should always be aiming to make them self-sufficient economically, politically, agriculturally, etc. It's nothing novel, but humans are still incredibly witless when it comes to this. Or rather, they reveal in their actions that they care much more about demonstrating virtue than solving these problems.
[03/11/2022, 21:05:29] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much. It usually comes when I spend too much time on the Internet. (We can get into my love-hate relationship with the Internet another time.)
[03/11/2022, 21:07:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes. And we have this insane % of GNI that needs to be invested into developing countries.
[03/11/2022, 21:07:27] Alex Regueiro: What I mean, helping them solve their structural problems where they live is so much more productive in the long-run, for both them and us.
[03/11/2022, 21:08:16] Alex Regueiro: Some progressives seem to think that all 7.5 billion people can live on some sort in paradisal multicultural Britain with no mind to resources!
[03/11/2022, 21:08:24] Alex Regueiro: UN directive?
[03/11/2022, 21:08:48] Alice Lafferty: Read some pessimistic projections that with Africa esp there is simply a natural resources/organisational/intelligence ceiling. Mind this was put out by an explicitly racist publication so..
[03/11/2022, 21:09:09] Alice Lafferty: It's half desert and half jungle.
[03/11/2022, 21:09:53] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. I certainly think Diamond's kind of argument is strong on this topic.
[03/11/2022, 21:11:32] Alice Lafferty: Parts of the DRC and rep of Congo I think sit on the world's largest source of sequestered carbon (peat bogs). So they're literally prohibited from building on lots of their land.
[03/11/2022, 21:12:01] Alex Regueiro: But we have such a disconnect from the natural world and from the (still fully valid) notion of human vulnerability and fragility that we consider ourselves impervious to all non-human factors, almost like we have an inherent right never to suffer privations.
[03/11/2022, 21:12:15] Alice Lafferty: There are like 40 million people living there but who cares.
[03/11/2022, 21:12:22] Alice Lafferty: Sorry kind of tangential
[03/11/2022, 21:13:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes it's nearly 1% I think.
[03/11/2022, 21:13:11] Alex Regueiro: I mean, yeah, this is what civilisation is about. Reducing the impact of the vicissitudes of nature to a minimum. But 21st C Westerners so detached from the reality of the situation it can't be healthy or constructive
[03/11/2022, 21:13:38] Alex Regueiro: I can believe it. UN arguably represents the worst of this mindset
[03/11/2022, 21:14:02] Alice Lafferty: Hah, I might have experienced something similar.
[03/11/2022, 21:14:30] Alex Regueiro: Interesting, didn't know. But yeah, we're quite happy to put harsh limitations on the material standard of living (and development) of these countries whilst simultaneously pretending to be their glorious saviours!
[03/11/2022, 21:17:55] Alice Lafferty: Don't they have like the best of ecological consultants to tell them what's what though
[03/11/2022, 21:18:27] Alex Regueiro: how do you mean?
[03/11/2022, 21:19:11] Alex Regueiro: BTW, don't know if you've come across Shellenberger, but I think he las largely very sensible views on this topic (intersection of environmentalism and economy, especially developing nations)
[03/11/2022, 21:19:15] Alice Lafferty: They are sheltered from nature as you said
[03/11/2022, 21:19:53] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, right
[03/11/2022, 21:20:00] Alice Lafferty: They may not have first hand experience but they have access to information about like, how ecosystems function.
[03/11/2022, 21:20:12] Alex Regueiro: It's a very selfish and arrogant attitude overall though
[03/11/2022, 21:20:38] Alice Lafferty: I haven't. Added to reading list!
[03/11/2022, 21:21:46] Alice Lafferty: I don't feel that well-placed to comment because I don't really know enough about the subject.
[03/11/2022, 21:22:33] Alex Regueiro: Only listened to a podcast episode and heard things second-hand from others, but he's definitely got intelligent views on the subject whether or not you fully agree.
[03/11/2022, 21:22:46] Alice Lafferty: I haven't even really got all my ducks in a row with a coherent value system, let alone thought about the best way to achieve those values.
[03/11/2022, 21:22:58] Alex Regueiro: Also, sorry, I'm definitely going to be responsible for your reading and listening lists ballooning to unmanageable proportions.
[03/11/2022, 21:23:01] Alex Regueiro: (But not really sorry)
[03/11/2022, 21:24:09] Alex Regueiro: That sort of modesty is good. I prefer not to claim I have a wonderful overarching ethical system (or any other sort of value system) either, though I'll certainly express opinions on more localised matters
[03/11/2022, 21:24:52] Alex Regueiro: (and with much hesitancy, on larger-scale inter-disciplinary matters)
[03/11/2022, 21:24:55] Alice Lafferty: I can't get over the arbitrariness of being born in say Bangladesh and suffering food scarcity vs 'happening to' have been born in the UK and not.
[03/11/2022, 21:26:12] Alice Lafferty: Probably because I have been inculcated by a culturally relativistic education, but I don't strongly feel I have 'a right' to European abundance just because I was born here..
[03/11/2022, 21:26:39] Alex Regueiro: I've grappled with that too at some point, though my pragmatism and fatalism of sorts helps a lot these days! But what's your perspective, tell me?
[03/11/2022, 21:26:45] Alex Regueiro: ahh
[03/11/2022, 21:26:49] Alice Lafferty: This is because I do not have a sense of a passage of material and social goods flowing downwards from my ancestors to me.
[03/11/2022, 21:27:09] Alice Lafferty: I do not feel 'connected' to land or people.
[03/11/2022, 21:27:15] Alice Lafferty: I don't know about you?
[03/11/2022, 21:27:41] Alice Lafferty: Hm, yesterday it was me who was the fatalist!
[03/11/2022, 21:28:07] Alice Lafferty: It's fine, I'm really keen to read as much as I can.
[03/11/2022, 21:28:50] Alex Regueiro: Two days ago no? But yeah! I'm using fatalism in a very neutral sense here, just that our fates are well beyond our control and in some imposed on us. I don't deny human agency itself but... well, this could turn into a discussion of free will now.
[03/11/2022, 21:29:46] Alex Regueiro: I think the issue for me is that we've been inculcated with all these notions of "rights" and "privileges" in a highly liberal-individualist framework, and as I see it these concepts all breakdown at some level. We don't recognise that they're purely posited and constructed at the end of the day
[03/11/2022, 21:30:02] Alice Lafferty: Yes same. I tend to take things on a case by case basis, which I guess is technically Situationism.
[03/11/2022, 21:30:27] Alice Lafferty: *situationalism? Don't know.
[03/11/2022, 21:30:51] Alex Regueiro: Deracination, I think is the term! And it's an enormous shame. It's a great hurdle to human flourishing, and one the more pernicious but unintended consequences of liberalism.
[03/11/2022, 21:31:22] Alex Regueiro: That's great. I really need to make more time for reading agian, myself.
[03/11/2022, 21:32:24] Alex Regueiro: Rings a bell! Couldn't say more.
[03/11/2022, 21:33:26] Alice Lafferty: We're uncomfortable with the fact that some people receive preferential treatment because of very essential atavistic things like genetics and kin bonds. From a depersonalised bird's eye view, 'everyone is equal', but from a particular subjective view, they are not.
[03/11/2022, 21:33:37] Alice Lafferty: That's it exactly.
[03/11/2022, 21:33:36] Alex Regueiro: BTW what did you think of Perry from the video? I'm not really a follower, but her Triggernometry episode was perhaps a better exposition.
[03/11/2022, 21:35:39] Alice Lafferty: Not even liberalism particularly but cosmopolitanism.
[03/11/2022, 21:35:52] Alex Regueiro: Yepp. This is one of the worst illusions that liberal values create, or at least they obscure the reality. We are fundamentally and profoundly UNequal, and that's really inherent to nature (and our nature). Equality under law is something entirely human-constructed, for the sake of its effects, and not because it has anything to do with an objective or higher truth about equality!
[03/11/2022, 21:36:26] Alice Lafferty: I think equality under the law and 'equality of opportunity' are still noble values.
[03/11/2022, 21:36:38] Alice Lafferty: But 'equality of outcome'? Of 'equity'?
[03/11/2022, 21:36:43] Alice Lafferty: There it breaks down
[03/11/2022, 21:36:44] Alex Regueiro: I know I criticise liberalism a lot, but I still think it's great in so many ways. We really couldn't foresee some of these consequences on society and our image of ourselves in this absurd university, to use the existentialist term.
[03/11/2022, 21:37:10] Alex Regueiro: And I agree, they're noble values. We just need to stress that even they are very artificial, and not speaking to some higher truth.
[03/11/2022, 21:40:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes, like most political systems it works well on paper.
[03/11/2022, 21:41:08] Alice Lafferty: People are maybe rightly afraid that if you admit they're artifical then where exactly do they derive their authority from?
[03/11/2022, 21:43:26] Alex Regueiro: Because one's working at a high level of abstraction, and lots of complexities that turn out to be important in reality got stripped away in the framework of the theory. And the assumptions are also incredibly problematic, being unempirical.
[03/11/2022, 21:43:36] Alice Lafferty: Seems sensible. I also looked at her Twitter, some of her other writing. If I was in the social category of 'women', I would follow her advice I think.
[03/11/2022, 21:45:02] Alex Regueiro: Rationalism is perhaps the most dangerous idea to come out of the Enlightenment to me. I don't reject it at all, it's just when it's too detached from empirical data, human nature, or common sense, you can logically justify all sorts of horrors and yet they still seem attractive on paper, even to their inventors.
[03/11/2022, 21:45:58] Alex Regueiro: As in the female gender? Who cares about that poppycock! Your biological sex is female, and beyond that you're free to be what you want.
[03/11/2022, 21:46:11] Alice Lafferty: This is the strength of 'traditionalism', they don't need a manifesto or a department full of 'politcal scientists', they can just point to the functioning society.
[03/11/2022, 21:46:40] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, to be clear, I meant the equality is artificial, in the sense of my previous message. (But no less just!)
[03/11/2022, 21:47:20] Alice Lafferty: Having said that, this in turn creates resistance to making changes which are genuinely beneficial.
[03/11/2022, 21:47:28] Alex Regueiro: Equality of legal rights and opportunity, here. (Which equality of outcome cannot help but diametrically oppose in so many cases.)
[03/11/2022, 21:48:53] Alice Lafferty: üòÇ I know but other people spoil things so!
[03/11/2022, 21:49:18] Alex Regueiro: Yep! I am convinced that my moderate traditionalism / cultural conservatism (and on the flip side real scepticism of progressivism and certain strands of rationalism) is a perfect bedfellow for my scientific/epistemological empiricism. üòÄ
[03/11/2022, 21:49:34] Alex Regueiro: I don't think many people make this connection though, sadly
[03/11/2022, 21:50:19] Alice Lafferty: Reminds me of the guy who said that it would be better for 1 person to be tortured for a life time than for 8 billion people to get a mote of dust in their eye. Who was that...
[03/11/2022, 21:50:27] Alex Regueiro: Damn people! They're the worst. Wish I weren't one sometimes hehe
[03/11/2022, 21:50:45] Alice Lafferty: Because hedonic calculator
[03/11/2022, 21:50:48] Alice Lafferty: Says so
[03/11/2022, 21:51:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh my... the pure and naive utilitarian! Give me the shiver these days
[03/11/2022, 21:51:11] Alex Regueiro: yupp
[03/11/2022, 21:51:26] Alice Lafferty: You're actually right. I hadn't thought about it like that before.
[03/11/2022, 21:52:15] Alex Regueiro: I've always joked about being a misanthrope. And I think I genuinely have been one at times, but only in part. I'm sufficiently strange that a good misanthropic quote will actually cheer me up often.
[03/11/2022, 21:52:20] Alice Lafferty: Liberals tend to be the ones to make all the big epistemological claims.
[03/11/2022, 21:52:38] Alex Regueiro: üôÇ
[03/11/2022, 21:52:45] Alice Lafferty: But how many actually come in the form of thought experiments, now that I think of it.
[03/11/2022, 21:52:54] Alex Regueiro: I'll claim it as my own insight, though I'm sure I wasn't the first to make it
[03/11/2022, 21:53:11] Alice Lafferty: Like Rawls' veil of ignorance.
[03/11/2022, 21:54:03] Alex Regueiro: For sure. I would probably amend that to "progressives", but I think we're on the same page. The burden of proof is on them, and they seldom acknowledge it.
[03/11/2022, 21:54:08] Alex Regueiro: Epistemology lessons in order, me thinks? A bit of Russell's teapot?
[03/11/2022, 21:54:36] Alex Regueiro: Thought experiments are wonderful tools, but incredibly dangerous. I know this from physics/science alone.
[03/11/2022, 21:55:41] Alice Lafferty: At my worst I can be extremely misanthropic. Esp when I think of Darwinian motivations underlying even the most benevolent or 'altruistic' actions.
[03/11/2022, 21:57:07] Alice Lafferty: This was obviously huge for theologians. Very funny answers some of them came up with.
[03/11/2022, 21:57:33] Alice Lafferty: But I've talked about this enough already!
[03/11/2022, 21:57:54] Alex Regueiro: I get that. What I try to do these days is not to fight back against Darwinism or evo psych or anything like that, but fully embrace it as a descriptive/scientific explanation for these phenomena, but not an axiological/personally meaningful one. How well you can separate these two categories or perspectives I don't know, but I have a hunch it's the right approach. Or at least the path away from nihilism and misanthropy!
[03/11/2022, 21:58:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah this is making me think of the first messages we exchanged heh
[03/11/2022, 21:59:10] Alice Lafferty: But it's a universal acid. It destroys the ability for personal meaning because personality is just a vessel for genes.
[03/11/2022, 21:59:11] Alex Regueiro: Been so long since I looked at Rawls properly, but it's a good example. Academics are unfortunately some of the most prone to these problematic modes of thinking.
[03/11/2022, 21:59:41] Alex Regueiro: Category error? üòÄ
[03/11/2022, 21:59:44] Alex Regueiro: I joke, I'm not actually sure
[03/11/2022, 22:01:59] Alice Lafferty: Maybe. The problem seems to be that our cognition and perception is biased towards fitness rather than revelation of truth or whatever.
[03/11/2022, 22:02:28] Alice Lafferty: So even if there were such extra-physical truths, we may not even be able to access them.
[03/11/2022, 22:02:31] Alex Regueiro: I'm now even keener to find out what Miss Alice thinks about Fraenkel's work!
[03/11/2022, 22:02:43] Alex Regueiro: right
[03/11/2022, 22:03:13] Alex Regueiro: We're only accidentally/tangentially 'machines' for arriving at truths. But truth is pragmatic and constructed so... maybe that's not a problem?!
[03/11/2022, 22:03:46] Alice Lafferty: I did look him up and there seemed to be more than one. Did you mean Abraham Fraenkel the mathematician?
[03/11/2022, 22:04:06] Alex Regueiro: Viktor Fraenkel
[03/11/2022, 22:04:07] Alex Regueiro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning
[03/11/2022, 22:04:16] Alice Lafferty: Ohh
[03/11/2022, 22:04:22] Alex Regueiro: I would never dare seek ethical enlightenment from a mathematician!
[03/11/2022, 22:04:26] Alice Lafferty: Thank you üëç
[03/11/2022, 22:04:28] Alex Regueiro: or existential
[03/11/2022, 22:05:28] Alice Lafferty: How can truth be pragmatic?
[03/11/2022, 22:05:46] Alex Regueiro: Even if it doesn't completely win you over, I think you'll find it stimulating/provocative.
[03/11/2022, 22:06:20] Alex Regueiro: He throws the occasional barbs at American culture too which is quite fun. And this was in the 50s; it fits even better today.
[03/11/2022, 22:07:39] Alex Regueiro: Good question, but big question. Do you mind if I save this for in person? I haven't actually read a lot of Pierce or James or Dewey, but I have my own views, especially with regards to philosophy of science.
[03/11/2022, 22:08:43] Alice Lafferty: He was a victim of the Holocaust. Does he develop a kind of meaning-through-suffering? I find that incredible.
[03/11/2022, 22:09:09] Alex Regueiro: not quite
[03/11/2022, 22:09:25] Alice Lafferty: Of course. And nor have I.
[03/11/2022, 22:09:28] Alex Regueiro: he stresses that unnecessary suffering is simply masochistic, and no meaning can be found through that
[03/11/2022, 22:10:12] Alex Regueiro: but necessary suffering as a challenge in an unavoidable circumstance that itself defines your scope for achieving meaning... that's another matter
[03/11/2022, 22:10:28] Alice Lafferty: I have to say I agree. Not that it's meaningful to compare my 'suffering' to his.
[03/11/2022, 22:10:28] Alex Regueiro: So, he's not ascetic, for sure.
[03/11/2022, 22:10:49] Alice Lafferty: Ok, not that terrible strain of Christianity in which suffering is purifying.
[03/11/2022, 22:12:18] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, but we all have our own forms. Mathematically, I would not dare say forms of suffering fit into a "total order". üòâ Any human knows what suffering it is, it just needs some unpacking as an idea.
[03/11/2022, 22:12:23] Alex Regueiro: Hah no, thankfully not
[03/11/2022, 22:12:30] Alex Regueiro: or indeed Hinduism or Buddhism
[03/11/2022, 22:12:40] Alex Regueiro: (more or less?)
[03/11/2022, 22:14:23] Alice Lafferty: I'm unsure about this too. It was just a concession made to the scale of the tragedy.
[03/11/2022, 22:14:53] Alice Lafferty: One of the 'three marks of existence' in Buddhism is suffering.
[03/11/2022, 22:15:03] Alex Regueiro: You might find that he makes a lot of postulates, but he's very cognisant of this, and intellectually honest. He thinks all we can do is a pose a system and see if it works for you. Since this is "philosophy of life", it's more on a personal basis, though at a statistical level there's empirical data too. He is obviously concerned with promulgating a theory, so anecdotes are usually more persuasive.
[03/11/2022, 22:15:45] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely. I would've said something similar. Just to show humility and humanity in the face of such obviously immense suffering and tragedy
[03/11/2022, 22:16:02] Alice Lafferty: But I don't believe Buddhism makes positive value judgement about it.
[03/11/2022, 22:16:04] Alex Regueiro: I flirted with Buddhism for a while in my early 20s, but it ended up being too life-denying for me, fuundamentally
[03/11/2022, 22:16:15] Alice Lafferty: Buddhism is utterly utterly nihilistic.
[03/11/2022, 22:16:25] Alex Regueiro: Not necessarily. It certainly says it's inevitable though, and deals a lot with it!
[03/11/2022, 22:16:47] Alex Regueiro: Stoicism is like a better version of Buddhism for me, but I still have gripes there too
[03/11/2022, 22:17:35] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm looking forward to reading. The Penrose book (Emperor's New Mind) has arrived, but I haven't started it yet!
[03/11/2022, 22:18:04] Alex Regueiro: I think it was Epictetus who was a Stoic but surprisingly generous to Epicurean philosophy. I had so much sympathy with his perspective.
[03/11/2022, 22:18:11] Alex Regueiro: All in your own time!
[03/11/2022, 22:19:07] Alice Lafferty: I only know the pop culture version of stoicism unfortunately.
[03/11/2022, 22:19:42] Alex Regueiro: I've read the Meditations and some Seneca and Epictetus but I've forgotten so much, so we should probably both learn more before discussing!@
[03/11/2022, 22:20:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes, lots of people do I think! I wonder which texts you used? Because the Westernised reception of Buddhism is quite a distortion, or so I've been led to believe.
[03/11/2022, 22:20:50] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, it definitely is. I was drawn to Theravada Buddhism, which is meant to be more originalist and authentic.
[03/11/2022, 22:20:54] Alice Lafferty: It seems similar to Buddhism in that it dispenses of comforting narrative and fables.
[03/11/2022, 22:21:01] Alex Regueiro: Something like Tibbetan Buddhism would have driven me nuts
[03/11/2022, 22:21:20] Alex Regueiro: I dabbled around in texts... completely forget now
[03/11/2022, 22:21:43] Alex Regueiro: Yes, and I still have a lot of affinity for that approach.
[03/11/2022, 22:22:03] Alice Lafferty: Interestingly I was going to begin learning Sanskrit this term, had I stayed on.
[03/11/2022, 22:22:18] Alex Regueiro: Some say that Stoicism was significantly influenced by Buddhism because there was a huge interchange of ideas following Alexander's conquest of NW India.
[03/11/2022, 22:22:34] Alice Lafferty: Which is the language of lots of the original texts. That and Pali.
[03/11/2022, 22:22:36] Alex Regueiro: Oh fun. I hear it's really difficult. Did you ever do Latin or Greek?
[03/11/2022, 22:22:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. In Theravada there's the "Pali Canon".
[03/11/2022, 22:23:15] Alice Lafferty: Have a GCSE in Latin! Hic haec hoc dickory dock.
[03/11/2022, 22:23:33] Alice Lafferty: It's been fairly useful so far
[03/11/2022, 22:23:36] Alice Lafferty: Have you?
[03/11/2022, 22:23:50] Alex Regueiro: And then Christianity was influenced by Stoicism, some say. Although obviously early Church Fathers railed against Stoicism in certain ways. I shan't say any more though, at the risk of exposing myself as a fool.
[03/11/2022, 22:25:06] Alex Regueiro: Haha. I did Latin GCSE too. Loved it, and had some amount of ability for it. Would have continued if I had another A-level spare.
[03/11/2022, 22:25:45] Alice Lafferty: I don't see why that would be. Stoicism was just an offshoot of Platonism right? And most early Christian theology is appropriated Platonism.
[03/11/2022, 22:25:51] Alex Regueiro: Yes I imagine! Though I wouldn't blame you if you don't feel up for reading the complete Summa Theologica in its original form. üòâ
[03/11/2022, 22:26:29] Alex Regueiro: No no, Stoicism was quite independent. I know some have said Platonism influenced Christianity too, though again Church Fathers spent quite some effort attacking Neo-Platonism
[03/11/2022, 22:26:46] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I missed your second sentence, sorry. Yes...
[03/11/2022, 22:27:20] Alice Lafferty: Aquinas is a huge bore. It was bad enough in English but with a Latin handbook too...
[03/11/2022, 22:27:51] Alice Lafferty: I thought they all essentially derived from Socrates
[03/11/2022, 22:27:52] Alex Regueiro: That really doesn't surprise me heh
[03/11/2022, 22:28:35] Alex Regueiro: Almost all Greek and later Middle Eastern philosophy owes a debt to Socrates in some way, yeah...
[03/11/2022, 22:28:41] Alex Regueiro: Then again, there were the Pre-Socratics
[03/11/2022, 22:29:27] Alex Regueiro: Who were fully independent (hint's in the name!) but in general less influential on later philosophers
[03/11/2022, 22:29:29] Alice Lafferty: Huge gaps in my knowledge.
[03/11/2022, 22:30:09] Alex Regueiro: Don't despair though... you have so much time! Or if you prefer, just know I have huge gaps in my knowledge too.
[03/11/2022, 22:30:34] Alice Lafferty: We study a philosopher/y only to the extent that it influenced Christianity.
[03/11/2022, 22:31:04] Alex Regueiro: This discussion and our talk of misanthropy reminds me of setting up a Diogenes Club at Oxford at one point. Well, it was literally a Facebook group for myself and a few friends! Fittingly, we barely used it. But it was a good laugh.
[03/11/2022, 22:31:13] Alex Regueiro: To be expected eh...
[03/11/2022, 22:32:05] Alex Regueiro: I haven't actually read Sherlock Holmes... terrible me. I know a little about the real Diogenes though. He's too entertaining not to cover in any course with a philosophical flavour
[03/11/2022, 22:32:56] Alice Lafferty: He's like the ur-eccentric genius.
[03/11/2022, 22:33:16] Alice Lafferty: Ha, that sounds fun, and makes me wish I'd gotten into the university social life a bit more!
[03/11/2022, 22:33:55] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. Or maybe the ultimate lunatic-masquerading-as-an-intellectual?
[03/11/2022, 22:34:27] Alex Regueiro: Either way, his picture would have been under the definition of "based" if he'd lived today!
[03/11/2022, 22:35:55] Alex Regueiro: It probably still exists even. Haven't checked. But yeah, it was good fun in a quirky nerdy misfit way.
[03/11/2022, 22:36:02] Alex Regueiro: And you still may have time...
[03/11/2022, 22:36:48] Alice Lafferty: Platonism was not criticised in particular, it's just that church fathers insisted on a very specific interpretation. Everything else was, you guessed it, heretical.
[03/11/2022, 22:37:36] Alex Regueiro: Oh fair enough. I know Stoicism was though. Mind you, I think it was already dead and buried by the time of Augustine.
[03/11/2022, 22:37:55] Alice Lafferty: Christian mistrust of pleasure/the body is the clearest Platonic legacy I think.
[03/11/2022, 22:38:20] Alex Regueiro: Makes sense
[03/11/2022, 22:38:29] Alex Regueiro: Gnosticism must have inherited quite a bit from Platonism no?
[03/11/2022, 22:38:30] Alice Lafferty: Did he actually contribute anything...
[03/11/2022, 22:38:50] Alice Lafferty: I only know the living in a barrel and masturbating in public stories. Was he just like a cynic?
[03/11/2022, 22:38:55] Alex Regueiro: Cynicism directly gave rise to Stoicism!
[03/11/2022, 22:40:18] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, that's him. And going around the agora at midday with a lamp saying he's looking for an honest man.
[03/11/2022, 22:40:23] Alice Lafferty: Well imo gnosticism is literally Platonism put into practice yes. It's essentially emmanationist. Some disagree and say the dualistic theology is Persian in origin but... it's quite contentious.
[03/11/2022, 22:40:46] Alex Regueiro: And telling Alexander the Great to stop blocking his sunlight when he offered to grant him any request.
[03/11/2022, 22:41:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes so he was a famous wag
[03/11/2022, 22:41:25] Alex Regueiro: I imagine. Not sure when Manichaeism dates from exactly, but clear similarities too.
[03/11/2022, 22:42:22] Alice Lafferty: Manichaeism is extremely important because Augustine was a one briefly, and never really slew of the dualism.
[03/11/2022, 22:42:37] Alice Lafferty: *slew is that the past tense of 'slough'?
[03/11/2022, 22:42:45] Alex Regueiro: Diogenes also wins kudos for taking the piss out of Plato.
[03/11/2022, 22:42:59] Alice Lafferty: Sloughed
[03/11/2022, 22:43:02] Alice Lafferty: Anyway sorry!
[03/11/2022, 22:43:07] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, I recall that now. In between his hedonistic and Christian stages?
[03/11/2022, 22:43:48] Alice Lafferty: He's the man of many conversions.
[03/11/2022, 22:43:54] Alice Lafferty: Seven or maybe eight.
[03/11/2022, 22:43:54] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[03/11/2022, 22:43:57] Alex Regueiro: Wow
[03/11/2022, 22:44:07] Alex Regueiro: Is City of God or Confessions a good read?
[03/11/2022, 22:44:16] Alice Lafferty: No!
[03/11/2022, 22:45:05] Alice Lafferty: Confessions is absolutely self-indulgent meditation on his own personal neuroses, which became the neuroses of the entire Catholic Church.
[03/11/2022, 22:45:17] Alex Regueiro: Oh dear
[03/11/2022, 22:45:24] Alex Regueiro: Even from the little I know of Saint Augustine, this explains a lot...
[03/11/2022, 22:46:02] Alice Lafferty: City of God is a bit better.
[03/11/2022, 22:46:37] Alice Lafferty: I may have said this before but I find his influence on the Church regrettable to say the least.
[03/11/2022, 22:46:46] Alex Regueiro: I don't think you did. But good to know.
[03/11/2022, 22:47:20] Alex Regueiro: Is there any great Christian theologian or saint that you have some fondness for?
[03/11/2022, 22:48:06] Alice Lafferty: By the way, sorry if I'm taking up too much of your time. I don't get the opportunity to discuss things I'm interested in that often, esp since leaving university, so I'm info-dumping a bit... I know that it's a bit more regular for you.
[03/11/2022, 22:48:45] Alex Regueiro: Please don't apologise. I wouldn't be here chatting with you if I weren't interested too!
[03/11/2022, 22:49:04] Alice Lafferty: Lots, Pelagius, Arius, Novation, Bernard of Clairvaux, Raymond Llull, Karl Barth
[03/11/2022, 22:49:18] Alice Lafferty: You might be interested in Raymond Llull actually.
[03/11/2022, 22:49:28] Alex Regueiro: I'm definitely learning things here. And getting to know you a bit better too. So I'm happy. üôÇ
[03/11/2022, 22:49:39] Alex Regueiro: I haven't even heard of him!
[03/11/2022, 22:49:41] Alex Regueiro: Catalan?
[03/11/2022, 22:49:55] Alice Lafferty: He invented some primitive computational theory.
[03/11/2022, 22:50:00] Alex Regueiro: oh cool
[03/11/2022, 22:50:34] Alice Lafferty: Definitely Spanish, I'm not sure specifically. Do you recognise the surname?
[03/11/2022, 22:51:16] Alex Regueiro: It sounds Catalan
[03/11/2022, 22:51:28] Alex Regueiro: Ah, he was from Majorca. Same linguistic-cultural sphere
[03/11/2022, 22:51:41] Alice Lafferty: Oh right
[03/11/2022, 22:52:30] Alice Lafferty: The theologians I like are quite a disparate group, I think what unites them is some kind of humility in their writing.
[03/11/2022, 22:52:43] Alex Regueiro: Was Roger Bacon a good theologian? He was it just his empirical philosophy and science that was impressive?
[03/11/2022, 22:54:22] Alex Regueiro: And what about the rebels? Safe to say you have no love for Calvin, but how about Luther, Melancthon, Hus? I think you said you liked Wycliffe.
[03/11/2022, 22:54:23] Alice Lafferty: Ha watching Question Time with my parents
[03/11/2022, 22:55:10] Alex Regueiro: Or the great Alcuin of York. I just remembered him.
[03/11/2022, 22:55:28] Alex Regueiro: Any good? It's been a while since I last saw it
[03/11/2022, 22:55:45] Alice Lafferty: I haven't studied him to any depth but I think he was very much part of the alchemical/proto scientific movement.
[03/11/2022, 22:56:25] Alice Lafferty: Luther also believed in predestination, which I struggle to get over
[03/11/2022, 22:56:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I know him from that. Was just aware he was a theologian too, and didn't know anything about that side of his work.
[03/11/2022, 22:57:11] Alex Regueiro: Honestly didn't know that. Curious how Lutherans don't then! (Right?)
[03/11/2022, 22:57:45] Alice Lafferty: I like Wycliffe, more so for his liturgical thought than theological.
[03/11/2022, 22:59:57] Alice Lafferty: I'm actually not sure. I thought it was some hybrid version like Catholicism/E Orthodoxy. The distinction is temporal more than anything.
[03/11/2022, 23:00:43] Alex Regueiro: I like Arianism just because he was sort of trying to talk common sense, and a rebel against the increasingly politicised Church.
[03/11/2022, 23:00:48] Alice Lafferty: Calvinists believe in predestination ie. before your life has even begun, but Lutherans believe that God grants grace during one's lifetime.
[03/11/2022, 23:00:56] Alex Regueiro: I mean, based on the doctrine of subordination, which is the only thing I know about it
[03/11/2022, 23:01:00] Alice Lafferty: The result is the same in that salvation is bascially arbitrary.
[03/11/2022, 23:01:12] Alice Lafferty: That's why Lutherans are sometimes called 'hesitant Calvinists'.
[03/11/2022, 23:01:29] Alex Regueiro: Intriguing! Thank you for elaborating
[03/11/2022, 23:01:38] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. It has a much stronger Biblical footing imo.
[03/11/2022, 23:02:22] Alex Regueiro: Also because all the rampaging Goths with Arian Christians, which makes it more fun.
[03/11/2022, 23:02:36] Alex Regueiro: (Not that I particularly love the Goths or goths for that matter. Gothic architecture on the other hand...)
[03/11/2022, 23:03:21] Alice Lafferty: Arianism seemed to have more success with them. I think that even quite late into the middle ages there were Arian cults in Germany all the way down to Turkey.
[03/11/2022, 23:03:53] Alice Lafferty: If you read the Bible with no priors, subordinationism is the only Trinitarian configuration that makes sense.
[03/11/2022, 23:03:58] Alex Regueiro: Wow, I really didn't know that. Survived in the backwaters of the Holy Roman Empire?
[03/11/2022, 23:03:58] Alice Lafferty: This is immediately clear
[03/11/2022, 23:06:14] Alice Lafferty: I'm not going to actually pull out Bible quotations but...
[03/11/2022, 23:06:35] Alice Lafferty: I don't want you to actually die of boredom.
[03/11/2022, 23:07:50] Alex Regueiro: I did always get the feeling that Church dogma was had very shaky foundations with relation to the Bible. Beginning at least with the First Nicaean Council, but possibly earlier? i.e. The dogma decided at these councils was really based on pragmatic and political reasons, with a cover story using Biblical exegesis.
[03/11/2022, 23:07:54] Alex Regueiro: hah
[03/11/2022, 23:08:12] Alice Lafferty: This is all true.
[03/11/2022, 23:09:00] Alice Lafferty: In some ways it hardly matters what's written on the page, such is the mutilation it undergoes from the magisterium.
[03/11/2022, 23:09:26] Alice Lafferty: The Bible is a Rorschach test of sorts
[03/11/2022, 23:10:06] Alex Regueiro: I really like that metaphor hah!
[03/11/2022, 23:10:51] Alex Regueiro: As are most religious texts, I imagine. Especially anything with an advanced tradition of hermeneutics/theology.
[03/11/2022, 23:11:15] Alice Lafferty: This is actually where I am a bit sympathetic with Protestantism, in that they make an honest attempt to cut away the ideological buildup, and allow people access to scripture unmediated by religious authority.
[03/11/2022, 23:11:45] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Fundamentalist... in the back to basics sense. I've sympathised with that too, in my ignorance.
[03/11/2022, 23:11:50] Alice Lafferty: Yes hermeneutics is the real political battle ground.
[03/11/2022, 23:12:29] Alice Lafferty: Imo Marcion had the right idea with trying to jettison the Old Testament entirely.!
[03/11/2022, 23:14:00] Alice Lafferty: * I mean, the doctrine of salvation has caused more schisms that I think any other issue. Largely because the NT blatantly contradicts most of the OT.
[03/11/2022, 23:14:08] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I can imagine so much theology has just been about trying to reconcile the huge differences in tone and the type of God portrayed. (I know one or two of the standard answers to this.)
[03/11/2022, 23:14:44] Alex Regueiro: I just looked up Mercion. So is the OT god like the demiurge? üòÑ
[03/11/2022, 23:14:50] Alice Lafferty: * and Marcion's solution was to simply 'replace' the OT. It was sensible and not without theological grounding.
[03/11/2022, 23:16:17] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[03/11/2022, 23:16:53] Alex Regueiro: I mean, Islam sort of did it, right? It accepted it's Judaeo-Christian heritage but didn't bring in the OT or NT as a canonical text.
[03/11/2022, 23:19:10] Alice Lafferty: Please bear with me because I don't know a huge amount about Islam, but I believe that the Islamic God has far more in common with the OT Judaic one.
[03/11/2022, 23:19:28] Alice Lafferty: And there wasn't a huge amount that needed 'reconciling' there.
[03/11/2022, 23:21:02] Alice Lafferty: I'm embarrassed about my lack of general knowledge on this... the components in my degree tended to be hyper specific.
[03/11/2022, 23:21:16] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I'd say so from my limited knowledge. But of course it still accepts Jesus as one of the three major prophets...
[03/11/2022, 23:21:30] Alex Regueiro: And neither the OT nor the NT is canonical
[03/11/2022, 23:21:46] Alice Lafferty: Esp regards 'personal
qualities like vengeance and jealousy.
[03/11/2022, 23:21:47] Alex Regueiro: of course, a big point of Islam is that these texts got distorted by humans and were no longer the direct word of God.
[03/11/2022, 23:22:05] Alice Lafferty: Right. The Quran was dictated by an angel
[03/11/2022, 23:22:07] Alice Lafferty: üôÑ
[03/11/2022, 23:22:30] Alex Regueiro: haha but of course
[03/11/2022, 23:22:39] Alex Regueiro: and Muhammed had an eidetic memory, as we know!
[03/11/2022, 23:22:49] Alice Lafferty: Again, the attempt at purity is admirable, but...
[03/11/2022, 23:22:51] Alex Regueiro: or whatever the audible equivalent is
[03/11/2022, 23:23:40] Alice Lafferty: You would think that would avoid schisms within Islam...
[03/11/2022, 23:24:32] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. And their main split really really early!
[03/11/2022, 23:25:29] Alice Lafferty: I think they have quite a pantheon of prophets and well-developed angelology.
[03/11/2022, 23:26:04] Alex Regueiro: I think so too, but isn't Jesus the second or third most important prophet to Muslims still?
[03/11/2022, 23:26:11] Alex Regueiro: Anyway we digree
[03/11/2022, 23:26:14] Alice Lafferty: But Islam is really not my speciality at all, I'm afraid.
[03/11/2022, 23:27:10] Alex Regueiro: Yes I din't think you cover it
[03/11/2022, 23:27:57] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I don't quite see how that happened, wasn't Jesus a bit uppity for just a prophet?
[03/11/2022, 23:27:59] Alex Regueiro: Do they actually call your course theology or divinity? I know, silly nomenclature point. I ws just thinking I hear "divinity" used quite a lot at Oxbridge.
[03/11/2022, 23:28:43] Alex Regueiro: Hah you'd think so. But I think Muslims say that Jesus never claimed he was the son of God, and this was naughty churchmen later distorting the prophet's message.
[03/11/2022, 23:31:56] Alex Regueiro: Okay, this has been genuinely fascinating, but after last night I'm going to press pause just to avoid philosophical-theological burnout!
[03/11/2022, 23:32:17] Alice Lafferty: I'm sorry, my battery just died.
[03/11/2022, 23:32:47] Alice Lafferty: Theology & religon & philosophy of relgion, which is a bit of a mouthful.
[03/11/2022, 23:32:58] Alice Lafferty: Although the faculty is the Divinity faculty which is a nice nod.
[03/11/2022, 23:33:00] Alex Regueiro: No prob. We reached a natural point of inflection anyway!
[03/11/2022, 23:33:19] Alice Lafferty: Ok sorry!
[03/11/2022, 23:33:41] Alex Regueiro: Hah I see. I still can't quite suss the difference. Maybe it's literally Greek vs Latin words?
[03/11/2022, 23:33:48] Alex Regueiro: Not at all! It's been great. üôÇ
[03/11/2022, 23:34:09] Alice Lafferty: Theologians were called 'divines' until quite recently.
[03/11/2022, 23:34:24] Alice Lafferty: Theology is greek, divinity is latin.
[03/11/2022, 23:34:57] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. It may be nothing more? Like, a rare case of perfect synonyms in English.
[03/11/2022, 23:35:24] Alex Regueiro: I know. I kind of liked that term, maybe because of its connotations based on the other sense...
[03/11/2022, 23:35:53] Alice Lafferty: If you're really interested in theology, I may not even be the best person to talk to. I've done 1/3 of a degree and honestly my interest has kind of wandered away from it over the last 6 months.
[03/11/2022, 23:36:26] Alex Regueiro: I have a extremely casual interest in truth.
[03/11/2022, 23:36:37] Alex Regueiro: But I enjoy talking to people about it, especially you
[03/11/2022, 23:37:07] Alex Regueiro: My interest in philosophy is a bit stronger but even then... I'm moving towards a sort of quietism or anti-philosophy in many ways lately. (Outside of philosophy of life, that is.)
[03/11/2022, 23:37:57] Alice Lafferty: Theology is not going to yield anything there.
[03/11/2022, 23:38:02] Alice Lafferty: Honestly I've tried
[03/11/2022, 23:38:52] Alex Regueiro: Then I shall defer to you! Always up for a good discussion like this however
[03/11/2022, 23:39:08] Alice Lafferty: It's more similar to world-building in that the soundness of the internal structure is more important than its correspondence with reality.
[03/11/2022, 23:39:11] Alex Regueiro: On a more casual note... done any more HTML/Python since you last mentioned?
[03/11/2022, 23:39:55] Alex Regueiro: Right, that makes sense. Quite similar to formal logic or even mathematics from a certain perspective! I don't think it's a coincidence that in the past there was a fair bit of overlap
[03/11/2022, 23:40:09] Alice Lafferty: I've finished the first Udemy course and have the ones you recommended up next.
[03/11/2022, 23:40:32] Alice Lafferty: HTML I've just kind of being picking up in a non-systematic way...
[03/11/2022, 23:40:40] Alice Lafferty: Probably should go back and learn it formally.
[03/11/2022, 23:40:45] Alex Regueiro: beyond just being a member of the clerisy...
[03/11/2022, 23:40:51] Alex Regueiro: Lewis Carroll is an interesting case
[03/11/2022, 23:41:16] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. You've really leapt out of the blocks.
[03/11/2022, 23:41:32] Alex Regueiro: To be fair that's probably good enough. It's really not very complex.
[03/11/2022, 23:41:39] Alice Lafferty: I doubt it will go anywhere.
[03/11/2022, 23:41:47] Alex Regueiro: Why do you say that?
[03/11/2022, 23:41:54] Alice Lafferty: It's just useful to know I think
[03/11/2022, 23:42:56] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. A taste for markup/document language and web technologies really can't go amiss even if you don't go down that path properly.
[03/11/2022, 23:43:13] Alice Lafferty: To give credit where it's due, divinity schools were where we made the first forays into science, logic and maths, as you say. These guys were all 'funded' by the Catholic Church.
[03/11/2022, 23:43:24] Alice Lafferty: *I mean closed monastic communities.
[03/11/2022, 23:44:15] Alice Lafferty: It's not at all dogma and reactionaries.
[03/11/2022, 23:44:18] Alex Regueiro: For sure. Whether that was the consequence of a culture that particularly promoted such things is debatable though, no? I mean, you might say it was by default, since these places where the only ones where men of learning could be found whatsoever until the Renaissance!
[03/11/2022, 23:44:32] Alice Lafferty: Quite simply because of wealth.
[03/11/2022, 23:44:53] Alex Regueiro: I've never thought that to be honest.
[03/11/2022, 23:45:24] Alex Regueiro: Reminded me of this really good debate, incidentally. Another for the playlist hah. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eSyz3BaVK8
[03/11/2022, 23:45:25] Alice Lafferty: No I know! But I reflexively say that because it's a common perception.
[03/11/2022, 23:45:43] Alex Regueiro: Dialectical materialism strikes again! You may well be right though.
[03/11/2022, 23:45:47] Alex Regueiro: It is, it is
[03/11/2022, 23:46:10] Alice Lafferty: :) you have to admit it's beautifully simply.
[03/11/2022, 23:46:15] Alice Lafferty: *simple
[03/11/2022, 23:46:36] Alice Lafferty: Thank you
[03/11/2022, 23:46:45] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I won't keep you any longer
[03/11/2022, 23:46:59] Alex Regueiro: It is. Very alluring.
[03/11/2022, 23:47:26] Alex Regueiro: Stop saying sorry, Alice! It's been a splendid chat.
[03/11/2022, 23:48:26] Alex Regueiro: Regardless, we might as well both go relax before bed now. üòä
[03/11/2022, 23:48:58] Alice Lafferty: Sorry couldn't help myself. It's on it's face a nonsense to say that Christianity is responsible for our values. All  civilisations develop strikingly similar ethical systems under vary diverse theological ones. I'm no fan of Grayling but I hope he makes that point.
[03/11/2022, 23:49:03] Alex Regueiro: hehe
[03/11/2022, 23:49:08] Alice Lafferty: Ok I'm going now.
[03/11/2022, 23:49:36] Alex Regueiro: I think Holland absolutely dominates the debate, but watch yourself and see!
[03/11/2022, 23:50:18] Alex Regueiro: And he's an agnostic who's about as hostile to New Atheism as dogmatic faith, like me, I'd say.
[03/11/2022, 23:50:55] Alice Lafferty: I will
[03/11/2022, 23:51:29] Alex Regueiro: Good night. Sweet dreams of the monophysite debate!
[03/11/2022, 23:51:38] Alex Regueiro: ...or something equally riveting
[03/11/2022, 23:51:53] Alice Lafferty: Are you trying to provoke me??
[03/11/2022, 23:53:27] Alex Regueiro: No, just a poor attempt at irony, I promise üòâ
[03/11/2022, 23:55:28] Alex Regueiro: I shall pray you are not visited by an incubus of theology!
[03/11/2022, 23:55:32] Alex Regueiro: 'Night
[05/11/2022, 13:25:46] Alex Regueiro: Hey Alice. Looking forward to later. Shall we meet at 7:00? Unless you want to go to the Q&A talk?
[05/11/2022, 16:31:11] Alice Lafferty: Hi, I'm really sorry but something's come up and I might not be able to make it tonight. I hope you're not too inconvenienced. Please let me know how I should reimburse you for the tickets.
[05/11/2022, 16:32:21] Alex Regueiro: Oh that's shame. Is something the matter?
[05/11/2022, 16:33:15] Alex Regueiro: And is it still a might or you definitely can't?
[05/11/2022, 16:34:50] Alice Lafferty: It will be quite difficult. I'm really sorry for the short notice.
[05/11/2022, 16:36:06] Alex Regueiro: That's alright. I'll assume you can't make it, but if things somehow work out before 6:15, just let me know.
[05/11/2022, 16:37:42] Alice Lafferty: Perhaps you can find someone else who's free/go by yourself? Please give me your Paypal/Apple Pay/whatever you use so I can pay you back for the tickets.
[05/11/2022, 16:38:00] Alex Regueiro: Okay
[05/11/2022, 16:38:38] Alex Regueiro: I'll best honest, it kind of sounds like you got cold feet / aren't interested. üôÅ
[05/11/2022, 16:41:20] Alice Lafferty: Actually, something came up with my parents. Combined with travelling in London, I don't think I'd make very gold company tonight, that's all
[05/11/2022, 16:42:59] Alex Regueiro: Ah right. I can understand that!
[05/11/2022, 16:43:19] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, it's just hard to read people over text chat heh
[05/11/2022, 16:43:30] Alex Regueiro: Take care for now, hope you sort it all out
[05/11/2022, 16:43:36] Alex Regueiro: Talk tomorrow maybe üôÇ
[05/11/2022, 16:43:41] Alice Lafferty: Thank you. I admit it's still not great to cancel at the such short notice.
[05/11/2022, 16:43:54] Alice Lafferty: So I apologise about that.
[05/11/2022, 16:43:58] Alex Regueiro: No no, I've done it to other people before too. Don't worry.
[05/11/2022, 16:44:21] Alice Lafferty: Will you still go to the concert?
[05/11/2022, 16:44:23] Alex Regueiro: It sucks, but it happens
[05/11/2022, 16:45:02] Alex Regueiro: Not sure. Could see if my dad is interested maybe
[05/11/2022, 16:45:26] Alex Regueiro: Don't feel bad about it regardless. Cheap tickets.
[05/11/2022, 16:45:39] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[05/11/2022, 16:45:47] Alice Lafferty: Even so I'd like to pay you back for them
[05/11/2022, 16:46:06] Alex Regueiro: That's nice of you to offer
[05/11/2022, 16:46:10] Alice Lafferty: Even as just general compensation for your time
[05/11/2022, 16:46:48] Alex Regueiro: If you're interested in going to another one soon, could just sort it out then.
[05/11/2022, 16:47:04] Alex Regueiro: But no big deal either way
[05/11/2022, 16:47:45] Alice Lafferty: Even the ticket ends up going to waste I'd feel better about paying for it.
[05/11/2022, 16:48:02] Alice Lafferty: I know it's not a huge sum of money or anything
[05/11/2022, 16:48:17] Alice Lafferty: Just in principle
[06/11/2022, 16:25:36] Alice Lafferty: Did you go in the end?
[06/11/2022, 17:59:58] Alex Regueiro: Hey... No, I didn't.
[06/11/2022, 18:00:34] Alex Regueiro: Was feeling a little off all yesterday, to be honest. So no great loss.
[06/11/2022, 18:00:56] Alex Regueiro: How was your evening? Everything sorted now I hope?
[06/11/2022, 20:03:07] Alice Lafferty: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[06/11/2022, 20:03:17] Alice Lafferty: I'm not going to drop the ticket issue by the way.
[06/11/2022, 20:03:46] Alex Regueiro: It's okay, I was going to follow up on that
[06/11/2022, 20:04:02] Alex Regueiro: ¬£7 (2 for booking) covers it üôÇ
[06/11/2022, 20:04:39] Alice Lafferty: Ok, and how should I pay you?
[06/11/2022, 20:05:03] Alex Regueiro: Paypal maybe?
[06/11/2022, 20:05:41] Alice Lafferty: Ok, what are you details?
[06/11/2022, 20:05:46] Alex Regueiro: alexreg@gmail.com
[06/11/2022, 20:06:07] Alice Lafferty: I'm pretty sure I have an account, it's a matter of logging in. I will do it in a secüëç
[06/11/2022, 20:06:26] Alex Regueiro: No worries. We can do it another way if not
[06/11/2022, 20:08:19] Alex Regueiro: Pigeon post even
[06/11/2022, 20:11:03] Alice Lafferty: Have you got it?
[06/11/2022, 20:11:19] Alex Regueiro: yep, thanks
[06/11/2022, 20:11:35] Alex Regueiro: Feel better about it all now?!
[06/11/2022, 20:14:52] Alice Lafferty: Ok great.
[06/11/2022, 20:22:22] Alex Regueiro: So is this something you're up for rearranging, or was what happened yesterday something to do with coming in to London / meeting me? I hate pestering you about this, only it would really help me to have an idea, even if you don't want to share the details. üôÇ
[06/11/2022, 20:45:04] Alice Lafferty: Yes I'd like to, what about the concert at Wigmore Hall?
[06/11/2022, 20:45:16] Alice Lafferty: That you mentioned
[06/11/2022, 20:45:32] Alex Regueiro: Oh good, that makes me glad
[06/11/2022, 20:45:37] Alex Regueiro: Sure, let me check it again...
[06/11/2022, 20:45:46] Alice Lafferty: Was it on the 11th?
[06/11/2022, 20:48:20] Alex Regueiro: yep
[06/11/2022, 20:49:30] Alice Lafferty: It was several things that all got on top of me yesterday. Also, I prefer to get the overground train into London but there was a rail strike yesterday, which meant I had to change my travel plans. I deal badly with that kind of thing.
[06/11/2022, 20:49:31] Alex Regueiro: There's also a SJSS one the next day (Rachmaninov & Shostakovich)
[06/11/2022, 20:49:52] Alice Lafferty: I am sorry again about cancelling last minute.
[06/11/2022, 20:50:07] Alice Lafferty: What the hell, I love Rachmaninoff and Shostakovich
[06/11/2022, 20:50:13] Alice Lafferty: I didn't see that
[06/11/2022, 20:50:24] Alice Lafferty: What exactly are they playing?
[06/11/2022, 20:50:25] Alex Regueiro: Gosh, I didn't even realise that. I think the Tubes were unaffected? I can totally get you wanting to take the overground, it's so much more pleasant
[06/11/2022, 20:50:28] Alex Regueiro: or less unpleasant, at least
[06/11/2022, 20:50:41] Alice Lafferty: Are they playing Shostakovich's second piano concerto
[06/11/2022, 20:50:48] Alex Regueiro: https://www.sjss.org.uk/events/fulham-symphony-orchestra-1
[06/11/2022, 20:50:55] Alex Regueiro: Rachmaninov's second piano concerto!
[06/11/2022, 20:50:59] Alex Regueiro: Shostakovich symphony no 8
[06/11/2022, 20:51:40] Alice Lafferty: Ok, nice.
[06/11/2022, 20:51:55] Alice Lafferty: Which do you prefer?
[06/11/2022, 20:52:30] Alice Lafferty: The tubes were unaffected but I don't actually live very close to a tube station. This isn't an excuse - I should just get a grip.
[06/11/2022, 20:52:46] Alex Regueiro: I think that's what my eccentric 6'8" Hungarian electromagnetics professor played for us in class once. I mentioned that didn't I?
[06/11/2022, 20:53:06] Alice Lafferty: *i meant which concert
[06/11/2022, 20:53:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes you did haha. Something you'd like to hear again?
[06/11/2022, 20:53:45] Alex Regueiro: Please don't beat yourself up about it. I really do sympathise. It should all work out in the end. Perhaps this concert will be better even!
[06/11/2022, 20:54:23] Alex Regueiro: Ah I missed that message. Probably the SJSS one for the programme, but the other one is nice too, so not too bothered.
[06/11/2022, 20:54:33] Alex Regueiro: Of course! Haven't listened to it in full in a while in fact
[06/11/2022, 20:54:42] Alice Lafferty: Also my parents wanted me to stay and have dinner with them. But still, I had a prior commitment to you so
[06/11/2022, 20:55:37] Alice Lafferty: Ok, let's go to SJSS. We can each book our own tickets this time?
[06/11/2022, 20:57:00] Alex Regueiro: It's alright. Hope your had a nice dinner with them. And maybe it was also fortuitous we avoided the din of Guy Fawkes night in London...
[06/11/2022, 20:58:25] Alex Regueiro: Ooh, there's also this one. Winterreise was on the playlist I sent you; not sure if you've listened yet.
[06/11/2022, 20:58:26] Alex Regueiro: https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/florian-boesch-malcolm-martineau-202211101930
[06/11/2022, 20:58:54] Alice Lafferty: I think there were fireworks in central London so public transport especially might have been very busy yes
[06/11/2022, 20:59:05] Alex Regueiro: Sure, whatever you prefer. Depends if you want to save on the ¬£3 transaction fee heh
[06/11/2022, 20:59:10] Alex Regueiro: indeed
[06/11/2022, 21:00:00] Alice Lafferty: I have, I did enjoy it, it's one I saved to my library. That would be cool to hear it in concert?
[06/11/2022, 21:00:23] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I'd be keen on either. Totally your choice.
[06/11/2022, 21:00:46] Alex Regueiro: Thursday vs Saturday, not sure if it makes a difference to you...
[06/11/2022, 21:00:49] Alice Lafferty: Why do some sites charge transaction fees and not others. Trainline does that as well
[06/11/2022, 21:01:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's weird. Pretty cheeky to be honest.
[06/11/2022, 21:01:55] Alice Lafferty: I'm pretty much free all week so
[06/11/2022, 21:04:24] Alice Lafferty: I do like Shostakovich but my 'white whale' was always his second piano concerto. Not as fussed about his symphonies.
[06/11/2022, 21:04:47] Alice Lafferty: Need to find abbreviations for Shostakovich and Rachmaninoff
[06/11/2022, 21:04:51] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair
[06/11/2022, 21:05:19] Alice Lafferty: Shos and Rach ü§¢
[06/11/2022, 21:05:32] Alice Lafferty: Or their initials
[06/11/2022, 21:05:34] Alex Regueiro: Funny you say that, I was going to use them but then I figured it was lazy because I'm typing!
[06/11/2022, 21:05:40] Alex Regueiro: Rach and Shosta are the common ones
[06/11/2022, 21:05:43] Alex Regueiro: but yeah kind of ugly
[06/11/2022, 21:05:58] Alice Lafferty: They're not very dignified
[06/11/2022, 21:06:02] Alex Regueiro: quite
[06/11/2022, 21:06:11] Alex Regueiro: Somehow demeans their genius
[06/11/2022, 21:07:43] Alice Lafferty: Either way, I might listen to bits of the programmes and tell you tomorrow which I'd rather see.
[06/11/2022, 21:07:53] Alice Lafferty: But like you said both sound good.
[06/11/2022, 21:07:53] Alex Regueiro: I'm definitely free both those days too, so I'm not bothered. Thursday might be a bit less hectic in London? Feel free to pick either though, really
[06/11/2022, 21:08:04] Alex Regueiro: Okay perfect
[06/11/2022, 21:08:17] Alice Lafferty: Yes good point.
[06/11/2022, 21:08:33] Alex Regueiro: Just me let know then. Almost no chance they'll sell out.
[06/11/2022, 21:08:41] Alice Lafferty: Is Wigmore Hall a nice venue too?
[06/11/2022, 21:09:23] Alex Regueiro: Wigmore Hall is beautiful. I prefer SJSS overall, Wigmore is really unique.
[06/11/2022, 21:09:31] Alice Lafferty: And is it important to you to get seats in the stalls?
[06/11/2022, 21:09:53] Alex Regueiro: It's an imperative to see concerts at both! In good time...
[06/11/2022, 21:10:29] Alex Regueiro: Not really. Wigmore has a small balcony at the back, which can be nice. SJSS sometimes opens up the balconies too, but not sure about this one.
[06/11/2022, 21:10:38] Alex Regueiro: They're both moderately sized
[06/11/2022, 21:10:40] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Wigmore is also a bit easier to get to.
[06/11/2022, 21:10:48] Alex Regueiro: Same here. Slightly.
[06/11/2022, 21:10:56] Alex Regueiro: But feel free to have a listen...
[06/11/2022, 21:11:06] Alex Regueiro: waiting won't hurt
[06/11/2022, 21:11:58] Alice Lafferty: The online journey planners all suggested going to Pimlico station (?) and then walking for 10 minutes to get to SJSS? Is that how you get there?
[06/11/2022, 21:12:42] Alex Regueiro: Err, that might be best for your route, but I usually get off at Westminster
[06/11/2022, 21:13:04] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure either works
[06/11/2022, 21:13:20] Alex Regueiro: Wigmore is Bond Street (slightly easier walk than Oxford Circus)
[06/11/2022, 21:13:23] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I don't know anything about indoor acoustics, how much of a difference seating makes... maybe not that much.
[06/11/2022, 21:13:39] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it did seem a weird route.
[06/11/2022, 21:13:42] Alex Regueiro: Oh you were thinking of acoustics... hmm, not much difference I think, at least at Wigmore
[06/11/2022, 21:14:42] Alice Lafferty: I don't know why I'm talking about it as if I would be able to tell the difference either way.
[06/11/2022, 21:14:55] Alice Lafferty: It's not like I have a trained ear
[06/11/2022, 21:15:29] Alex Regueiro: I can pick up on the dodgy acoustics in the Royal Albert Hall, that's about it...
[06/11/2022, 21:16:46] Alice Lafferty: Really, I've only been there twice but I didn't notice anything. So there you go
[06/11/2022, 21:17:14] Alex Regueiro: Was it for the Proms? They hang some sort of devices then so it's not too bad
[06/11/2022, 21:17:51] Alice Lafferty: It was to see Madame Butterfly
[06/11/2022, 21:17:52] Alex Regueiro: How was your Sunday by the way, relaxed? Do the cryptic crossword in the paper?
[06/11/2022, 21:18:16] Alex Regueiro: Ah very nice. I saw that at the ROH earlier this year.
[06/11/2022, 21:18:17] Alice Lafferty: And another time a kind of jazz singer my parents like called Gregory Porter
[06/11/2022, 21:18:54] Alice Lafferty: I would kind of like to see Tosca so I can listen to vissi d'arte
[06/11/2022, 21:19:44] Alice Lafferty: I really enjoyed it, but I'm not very discerning. I hardly know anything about opera! Maybe you're more into it?
[06/11/2022, 21:19:44] Alex Regueiro: I've only really been to smaller/club venues to listen to jazz in London. Not been for ages, but those were great.
[06/11/2022, 21:20:05] Alex Regueiro: I like opera, but not as into it as instrumental music I'd say
[06/11/2022, 21:20:14] Alex Regueiro: go to the ROH maybe twice a year, three times max
[06/11/2022, 21:21:06] Alice Lafferty: Yes, just quiet. I have been doing the crossword yes!
[06/11/2022, 21:21:44] Alice Lafferty: Huh, the only one I know is Ronnie Scotts. But maybe that's not a 'small' venue
[06/11/2022, 21:21:46] Alex Regueiro: The inane/vapid/cloying plots of some the opera buffa (Italian ones at least) get on my nerves pretty quickly. Maybe I need to try
[06/11/2022, 21:21:51] Alex Regueiro: Maybe I need to try Wagner *
[06/11/2022, 21:22:04] Alice Lafferty: That's three times more than most people
[06/11/2022, 21:23:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's super famous. There's also the 100 club, but haven't been
[06/11/2022, 21:23:47] Alice Lafferty: Yes they're a bit much. I often find the voices just kind of unpleasant sometimes
[06/11/2022, 21:23:50] Alex Regueiro: I liked The Other Palace too
[06/11/2022, 21:24:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I get you. It really depends on the aria. I have a few in my collection that I love, but some leave me cold or even grate a bit.
[06/11/2022, 21:25:21] Alice Lafferty: It's nice you've gotten to do all this stuff. I can see why you want to live in/around London.
[06/11/2022, 21:25:37] Alex Regueiro: Tosca is playing at the ROH in a month FYI üôÇ
[06/11/2022, 21:25:38] Alex Regueiro: https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/tosca-by-jonathan-kent-details
[06/11/2022, 21:26:16] Alice Lafferty: Ha, thanks for looking that up for me!
[06/11/2022, 21:26:21] Alex Regueiro: Culture is basically the only reason, though it's significant one. Maybe food to some extent too. Apart from that I'd probably be very happy in a small town or village!
[06/11/2022, 21:27:15] Alex Regueiro: Since I have so much flexibility with work
[06/11/2022, 21:27:16] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure I can justify going to see it on the strength of liking a single seven minute aria. I might look into it a bit more.
[06/11/2022, 21:27:37] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. Listen to some of the other bits maybe
[06/11/2022, 21:28:19] Alice Lafferty: You can go surprisingly far out into the countryside, or at least the home counties, and still be at a commutable distance from London.
[06/11/2022, 21:28:42] Alex Regueiro: Sometimes the overture is the best bit. Then you have to sit through 2 1/2 or 3 hours that of drudgery.
[06/11/2022, 21:29:19] Alice Lafferty: London's under an hour from Oxford, further out in Essex, I'm sure some parts of Sussex.
[06/11/2022, 21:29:48] Alex Regueiro: That's true. A friend from uni (actually first started to concerts regularly with him) lived at home in Milton Keynes and commuted in for a while. The tragic thing was that it was quicker for him to get to west London than me.
[06/11/2022, 21:30:53] Alice Lafferty: Yes you're really lucky. That is, if you can squeeze any time out of your 15 hour work week to catch a show in Londonüò¢
[06/11/2022, 21:31:00] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I'm joking obviously
[06/11/2022, 21:32:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes. The upside of living in Milton Keynes is a quick commute, the downside is living in Milton Keynes...
[06/11/2022, 21:33:44] Alice Lafferty: Plus that's hardly 'the countryside'.
[06/11/2022, 21:36:35] Alex Regueiro: Haha!
[06/11/2022, 21:37:25] Alex Regueiro: It's fine. I'm very fortunate I don't really need to work at the moment. Can afford to wait for a really good opportunity. Keeping plenty busy with my pet projects though!
[06/11/2022, 21:37:35] Alex Regueiro: Exactly
[06/11/2022, 21:38:16] Alex Regueiro: It was just meant to be an example of how living really far out is viable. But if you're going to live that far out, it really needs to be somewhere pretty and green!
[06/11/2022, 21:38:52] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, I thought you were working for a start-up?
[06/11/2022, 21:39:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, but I mean in the rest of my time
[06/11/2022, 21:39:08] Alice Lafferty: What kind of stuff are you working on?
[06/11/2022, 21:40:38] Alex Regueiro: Some open-source software, genealogical research, talking with friends about business ideas. I really should get onto machine learning. Been meaning to pick that up for ages.
[06/11/2022, 21:40:46] Alice Lafferty: Speaking of which, maybe it's just me but Github isn't very easy to use?
[06/11/2022, 21:41:13] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, it takes some getting used to, for sure. But compared to competitors I think it's fairly easy. What are you trying to do?
[06/11/2022, 21:42:02] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting, will that be like a service for the public to use?
[06/11/2022, 21:42:48] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, do you also know "E lucevan le stelle" from Tosca?
[06/11/2022, 21:43:02] Alex Regueiro: Will what be? These are all different little projects/ideas üôÇ
[06/11/2022, 21:43:32] Alex Regueiro: And yes, I commonly spread myself a bit thin heh
[06/11/2022, 21:43:38] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I meant the genealogical research
[06/11/2022, 21:43:56] Alice Lafferty: I don't, why?
[06/11/2022, 21:44:36] Alex Regueiro: Just curious. It's one of my favourite Puccini arias. I didn't actually know Vissi d'arte. ü´¢
[06/11/2022, 21:45:18] Alice Lafferty: I don't know what a 'branch' is. Don't worry, I'm not asking you to teach me! I can just look it up for myself. It's probably just because I have no CS background.
[06/11/2022, 21:46:46] Alice Lafferty: I know someone who's doing a CS degree with a machine learning speciality.
[06/11/2022, 21:47:00] Alice Lafferty: Maybe a fourth degree for you? :)
[06/11/2022, 21:47:20] Alex Regueiro: Oh. Mainly for my own family, so very much a pastime (albeit one that really sucks you in!). But I occasionally help others or compile useful resources (like a big database indexing county wills... I know, enthralling).
[06/11/2022, 21:48:03] Alice Lafferty: I don't think it's particularly famous or anything. I will look it up e lucevan le stelle
[06/11/2022, 21:48:06] Alex Regueiro: Hah, it's occurred to me. But since I have a background in both software engineering / computer science and mathematics, I think I can just study by myself more efficiently... in terms of time, energy, and cost.
[06/11/2022, 21:48:38] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAqHQMX7GHY
[06/11/2022, 21:48:40] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure you'e right
[06/11/2022, 21:50:00] Alex Regueiro: It's a very useful degree/speciality these days. I've met a few who have done the same.
[06/11/2022, 21:50:29] Alice Lafferty: No, cataloguing and taxonomising information is a valuable human endeavour. The filing cabinet was one of the most important inventions in history.
[06/11/2022, 21:50:38] Alice Lafferty: Thanks
[06/11/2022, 21:51:15] Alex Regueiro: I'm glad you think so. It's a little way I can give back to the community. And it also helps my research indirectly.
[06/11/2022, 21:51:37] Alex Regueiro: Actually, I just now remember you had "music cataloguing" on your OKC profile. üôÇ
[06/11/2022, 21:51:39] Alice Lafferty: So AI are more than just very complex if else statements...
[06/11/2022, 21:53:07] Alex Regueiro: Joining the two strands of our conversation... a good friend of mine from school (older, went to Cambridge) made an automated music cataloguing system for his final project. It didn't work particularly well, but it was a cool idea.
[06/11/2022, 21:53:56] Alex Regueiro: Ha yes. That's sort of how it was in the very early days of AI (50s, 60s) but now it's only one subfield.
[06/11/2022, 21:55:55] Alice Lafferty: That was a kind of extravagant description of what I do (collecting scraps of audios and finding their source and messing around on last.fm)
[06/11/2022, 21:56:06] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I didn't mean to link that.
[06/11/2022, 21:56:25] Alice Lafferty: It was triggered when I typed the web address I guess
[06/11/2022, 21:56:55] Alex Regueiro: I have a Last.fm profile, from ages ago, though I don't use it now really. But I think it still automatically 'scrobbles'.
[06/11/2022, 21:57:58] Alex Regueiro: That sounds like a novel sort of puzzle actually.
[06/11/2022, 21:58:40] Alice Lafferty: Oh nice. I just use online databases.
[06/11/2022, 21:58:57] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of nice to have the data
[06/11/2022, 21:59:19] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Can find trends and habits and use it to seek out new stuff
[06/11/2022, 22:00:55] Alex Regueiro: (or deficiencies for that matter)
[06/11/2022, 22:01:09] Alice Lafferty: I see. The only thing that gets discussed in the public sphere is the ethical implications of AI. I think most people (me included) have no idea how it actually works.
[06/11/2022, 22:01:58] Alex Regueiro: Here's one of my favourite arias if you're curious. The actual scenario in Rigoletto is really fatuous, but the music is wonderful. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6S_kx0gDzc
[06/11/2022, 22:02:19] Alex Regueiro: (Verdi is the master)
[06/11/2022, 22:02:54] Alice Lafferty: Thanks, I've added it to my watch later!
[06/11/2022, 22:03:11] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's a big problem when people start talking about the implications, because although the great hopes and graves concerns about AI are both totally legitimate, it's so easy to spout rubbish if you don't know how these things work at least at a general level.
[06/11/2022, 22:04:22] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I'm going to hold my tongue then
[06/11/2022, 22:06:55] Alex Regueiro: I meant in the public forum. You should feel free to speak about it. Or ask questions! (I'm very far from an expert, but I think I have a high-level appreciation at least, so I can try to answer.) One of my early hobby projects in programming was writing a basic neural network from scratch. And likewise a system for "evolutionary programming". Quite some time ago now.
[06/11/2022, 22:14:48] Alice Lafferty: That's one part I don't quite understand.
[06/11/2022, 22:16:17] Alice Lafferty: People anthropomorphise AI so much, as if it's going to 'evolve' the ability to reorientate its function towards its own goals rather than the programmer's goals.
[06/11/2022, 22:16:53] Alice Lafferty: I don't see how it could 'evolve' in an undesirable way, because we control the selection pressures acting on it?
[06/11/2022, 22:18:25] Alice Lafferty: Unless you encode random mutations or something... but still?
[06/11/2022, 22:18:32] Alex Regueiro: That's a fair point
[06/11/2022, 22:18:50] Alex Regueiro: You're right that it can never fundamentally reorient its goals by itself
[06/11/2022, 22:19:06] Alex Regueiro: unless you give it some meta-goal capable of reorienting goals
[06/11/2022, 22:19:33] Alex Regueiro: Though you could perhaps give it a very general and open-ended goal that could manifest itself in hard-to-foresee ways, right?
[06/11/2022, 22:19:35] Alice Lafferty: This is really impressive by the way.
[06/11/2022, 22:20:07] Alex Regueiro: Thanks. It was good fun. And well before AI became the "next big thing". Really need to get back into it.
[06/11/2022, 22:21:24] Alex Regueiro: (Not sure why I let it fall by the wayside... it should have spurred me on back then.)
[06/11/2022, 22:21:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes, it looks like a really exciting field.
[06/11/2022, 22:22:06] Alex Regueiro: I should probably tell you about the PhD I almost did in computational neuroscience at some point. Long-ish story though. üôÇ
[06/11/2022, 22:24:17] Alice Lafferty: Couldn't you endow it with the ability to forsee the consequences of its own actions, then make it's meta-goal: 'override any goal if it causes some quantifiable amount of harm to humans' ? Ok, I'm not even going to comment any further because I don't want to embarrass myself in front of you.
[06/11/2022, 22:25:05] Alice Lafferty: I'd be interested to hear! Artificial neural networks are supposed to mimic animal brains right?
[06/11/2022, 22:26:54] Alex Regueiro: No, that's a very sensible suggestion! I would say the devil is in the details, but that's the case with almost everything about AI... I mean, you know from philosophy how hard it is to define an adequate utility function if you're a utilitarian, though in the case of AI this concept of "harm" could be defined quite liberally so as to make AIs behave very conservatively.
[06/11/2022, 22:27:03] Alice Lafferty: I was reading this: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05189 , which draws an equivalence between neural networks and decision trees. Does that have the backwards implication that brains are 'just' decision trees?
[06/11/2022, 22:28:04] Alice Lafferty: There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of smarter people working on this. It's just a fun exercise to think about for me.
[06/11/2022, 22:28:43] Alex Regueiro: They are. They're so vastly simplified/abstracted though, it's now accepted that they lose some very important synchronic and diachronic features present in biological neural networks, hence current research focuses on generalisations of traditional ANN models in terms of both network structure, how individual neurons are modelled, and adding a temporal (or "spiking neuron") aspect to it all.
[06/11/2022, 22:29:29] Alex Regueiro: Life would be boring if you only talked about things you were a certified expert in. (And that would cause all sorts of social-dynamical problems too, I think.)
[06/11/2022, 22:31:07] Alex Regueiro: Interesting paper. How did you discover it? Intuitively it's surprising at first, but makes sense at some level (Turing completeness, etc.). The complexity of a decision tree corresponding to a given neural network would be so much larger though, I'd guess.
[06/11/2022, 22:33:18] Alice Lafferty: I see. They're vastly simpler than human brains but have much greater computational power?
[06/11/2022, 22:33:51] Alice Lafferty: Does our complexity slow down our processing power in some sense then?
[06/11/2022, 22:34:34] Alice Lafferty: Some internet rabbit hole. I was interested in whether AIs correspond morphologically to human brains, just as it pertained to my interest in consciousness.
[06/11/2022, 22:34:35] Alex Regueiro: It depends how you measure computational power, but if you restrict computers just to operate as neural networks, our brains are generally far superior, in terms of what they can 'compute', how fast they can do it, and the energy they require.
[06/11/2022, 22:35:28] Alex Regueiro: I forget exactly, but our brains have something like 100 billion neurons, and many trillions of synapses. Artificial neural networks can't even get remotely close to that. It's a matter of hardware architecture. Conventional computers just aren't very well suited to run neural networks
[06/11/2022, 22:35:39] Alex Regueiro: (which are fundamentally analogue and highly parallel/concurrent)
[06/11/2022, 22:35:56] Alice Lafferty: So the AIs like DALL-E and GP3 are not neural networks?
[06/11/2022, 22:38:21] Alex Regueiro: They're neural nets as far as I'm aware. I haven't really looked into them though. Might be GANs? (generative adversarial networks)
[06/11/2022, 22:40:16] Alice Lafferty: I struggle to understand how DALL-E could have less computational power than my own brain.
[06/11/2022, 22:40:28] Alex Regueiro: "Generative" in the sense that they produce comple doutput. Traditionally neural nets were designed and trained to make simple output (recognition and labelling tasks) based on complex input
[06/11/2022, 22:41:00] Alex Regueiro: Again, really depends how you measure it. But in terms of number of neurons or synapses, it's far far fewer.
[06/11/2022, 22:41:03] Alice Lafferty: It's not just searching a database.
[06/11/2022, 22:41:05] Alex Regueiro: It's also very domain-specific
[06/11/2022, 22:41:09] Alex Regueiro: unlike your brain
[06/11/2022, 22:41:26] Alex Regueiro: (though whether our brains are truly "general" in their intelligence is very debatable!)
[06/11/2022, 22:43:38] Alice Lafferty: Are the artifically generated images just more sophisticated versions of this? Are they just retrieving images linked to keywords and assembling them in a way that matches already existing images?
[06/11/2022, 22:45:03] Alice Lafferty: Eg if you type 'hat' and 'person' into DALL-E, it will not only retrieve images of a hat and a person, the hat will also usually be on the person's head.
[06/11/2022, 22:45:40] Alice Lafferty: I'm sorry, it must be frustrating for you to talk to me about this! We don't have to continue. I will go away and do 10+ years of research and then come back to you!
[06/11/2022, 22:47:04] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[06/11/2022, 22:47:07] Alex Regueiro: Not at all
[06/11/2022, 22:47:10] Alex Regueiro: It's fun
[06/11/2022, 22:47:17] Alex Regueiro: refreshing myself on some of these things too
[06/11/2022, 22:47:55] Alex Regueiro: In some sense yes. They come across very impressive, but they're really using pre-existing images they've been trained on, at quite a crude level.
[06/11/2022, 22:48:38] Alex Regueiro: They can't really produce something markedly different in content from what they've seen
[06/11/2022, 22:48:44] Alex Regueiro: But this is all a matter of degree, right?
[06/11/2022, 22:49:50] Alex Regueiro: Because we as humans rely at some level on our experiences, and examples or prototypes of objects or ideas we've already encountered, usually many times
[06/11/2022, 22:50:07] Alex Regueiro: Just we can abstract better, hence our works of art are much more original in some sense
[06/11/2022, 22:50:16] Alice Lafferty: I was just about to say, is this is truly different in humans.
[06/11/2022, 22:50:37] Alice Lafferty: But humans can describe geometrical patterns which they have never actually seen or which don't even exist in real life.
[06/11/2022, 22:50:54] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps only in degree, not qualitatively. Though the difference in degree is very considerable!
[06/11/2022, 22:51:31] Alex Regueiro: Right. Or come up with fantastical new creatures, objects, or landscapes. Not that DALL-E can't do this to some extent, but what it produces is far far less convincing or original.
[06/11/2022, 22:52:46] Alice Lafferty: Sorry to all the sci-fi & fantasy writers but imo 'fantasy creature's are just recombinations of already existing animals and not purely imaginative.
[06/11/2022, 22:53:19] Alice Lafferty: But it's only on its second iteration? It could become much more sophisticated?
[06/11/2022, 22:54:17] Alex Regueiro: I fully agree. But the way they go into the "stewpot" of our minds and come out in something that still looks very original and moreover "convincing" or "interesting" (and not just some random/arbitrary recombination) is something that AIs still can't do yet.
[06/11/2022, 22:54:33] Alice Lafferty: Is our understanding of 'intelligence' just the ability to abstract or extrapolate?
[06/11/2022, 22:54:36] Alex Regueiro: And they would need to get far more complex to be able to do so. There are so many considerations that go into a human doing this
[06/11/2022, 22:54:50] Alex Regueiro: Not merely combining familiar things in a new random way
[06/11/2022, 22:55:09] Alex Regueiro: But there's nothing theoretical preventing AIs from doing this
[06/11/2022, 22:55:39] Alice Lafferty: But I think they already do combine images in a familiar way, eg. the hat example.
[06/11/2022, 22:55:47] Alice Lafferty: At least some of the time, not 100%.
[06/11/2022, 22:56:05] Alex Regueiro: Such a difficult question. That's certainly one important aspect, but probably not all if you ask me personally. But then again, I have issues with the notion of "general" or "strong" AI. Definitely AI researchers don't have a great deal of consensus here
[06/11/2022, 22:56:34] Alex Regueiro: In a familiar way, sure, but we don't consider it particularly original or convincing as a work of art. And for good reason. It's still too arbitrary.
[06/11/2022, 22:57:11] Alex Regueiro: Mind you, these AIs can't be far off producing the level of contemporary abstract art that you might see at the Tate Modern!
[06/11/2022, 22:57:15] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting, so you believe there's some kind of ceiling or gap they will never been able to bridge?
[06/11/2022, 22:58:03] Alex Regueiro: Not necessarily. I think there are too many factors at play (many are biological or "hardware" related) to be able to authentically mimic a human brain without actually being built like a human brain.
[06/11/2022, 22:58:21] Alice Lafferty: The vast majority of humans can't create art that is particularly original or convincing.
[06/11/2022, 22:58:37] Alex Regueiro: But I think they will eventually match and exceed our abilities at certain tasks, problems, or even creative acts we consider very "human" today.
[06/11/2022, 22:59:20] Alice Lafferty: Do you believe in the  ,,singularity"
[06/11/2022, 23:00:10] Alice Lafferty: Or is that just a pop-science concept?
[06/11/2022, 23:00:14] Alex Regueiro: This is true hah. But I think most humans are capable of being "original" in some way. Maybe technical ability is the limiting factor for us, I'm not sure. In any case originality is far from all when it comes to "general AI"
[06/11/2022, 23:00:52] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it's a coherent concept in some ways
[06/11/2022, 23:01:16] Alex Regueiro: I still think there will be limits on growth of the power of AIs even with a singularity event though
[06/11/2022, 23:01:27] Alex Regueiro: Just ones 'higher' than human intelligence
[06/11/2022, 23:02:02] Alice Lafferty: My diet contains too much Nick Bostrom.
[06/11/2022, 23:02:13] Alice Lafferty: Maybe
[06/11/2022, 23:02:57] Alex Regueiro: The singularity is a pretty terrifying possibility no doubt. Enough to give you serious existential angst. If we got to the point where it could happen, I'd probably say it's a human moral imperative to do everything possible to prevent it
[06/11/2022, 23:03:09] Alex Regueiro: I'd more or less treat it like a nuclear holocaust!
[06/11/2022, 23:03:12] Alice Lafferty: You don't foresee an apocalyptic scenario then?
[06/11/2022, 23:03:34] Alice Lafferty: It's literally a modern eschatology.
[06/11/2022, 23:03:59] Alice Lafferty: And it's generated just reams of secondary literature.
[06/11/2022, 23:04:14] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I haven't read his stuff. Is it actually well-developed and subtle, or verging on fear-mongering?
[06/11/2022, 23:04:32] Alice Lafferty: Which barely makes reference to any actual science.
[06/11/2022, 23:04:54] Alex Regueiro: Haha precisely. Except without a saviour, from what I can tell
[06/11/2022, 23:06:06] Alex Regueiro: That's why I'm sceptical of a lot of this stuff. As I mentioned earlier, so much (not all) is uninformed by actual comprehension of the science of engineering, and therefore of minimal value. These days I don't believe in philosophy (of any sort, except perhaps philosophy of life) detached from a more concrete discipline.
[06/11/2022, 23:06:14] Alice Lafferty: He believes that it (singularity) has the potential to be very dangerous, but also that it's within our capacity to prevent.
[06/11/2022, 23:06:24] Alice Lafferty: So kind of a call to action rather than pessimism.
[06/11/2022, 23:06:33] Alex Regueiro: Commit it to the flames, as Hume said!
[06/11/2022, 23:06:44] Alex Regueiro: Okay. That's better than some.
[06/11/2022, 23:06:50] Alice Lafferty: Me too.
[06/11/2022, 23:09:46] Alex Regueiro: I also have a vaguely existential attitude to life (though not necessarily in a Sartre/Camus sense), so I don't see the creation of strong AI as being an intrinsically good thing for humankind (or even for the universe, if one dares say such a thing). The obvious implications of further big improvements to our material standard of living are fine, but there's so much more to it than that. It's another discussion, but arguably the huge increases in material standards over the last two centuries have had a really negative effect on the human psyche / spirituality / meaningfulness of life / whatever you want to call it.
[06/11/2022, 23:09:53] Alice Lafferty: The four horsemen will be Roko's basilisk, unstoppable paperclip factory, nano robots and DEATH.
[06/11/2022, 23:10:10] Alex Regueiro: That's enough armchair philosophising from me though, for now!
[06/11/2022, 23:12:17] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure if I agree with your last point... doesn't every age feel nostalgia for the ones gone by? As if there was ever a time when humanity was 'pure'?
[06/11/2022, 23:12:24] Alex Regueiro: Don't worry we have a good 20-30 years before this. Until then, we shall eat, drink, and be merry!
[06/11/2022, 23:13:02] Alice Lafferty: In all seriousness what kind of timeframe should we be looking at?
[06/11/2022, 23:13:12] Alex Regueiro: I'm not saying it's a bad thing at all, just that it's had profound implications on how we face life, and given us lots of angst in some ways. We have to at least adjust, and it's not been easy (and will continue to be very hard).
[06/11/2022, 23:13:29] Alice Lafferty: Life in the past was richer and more brutal in ways we can't imagine now.
[06/11/2022, 23:13:39] Alex Regueiro: So hard to know. People have been saying strong AI is 10 years away for the last 50 years or so...
[06/11/2022, 23:13:46] Alex Regueiro: Just like fusion energy üòõ
[06/11/2022, 23:14:32] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. Like peak oil and driverless cars too.
[06/11/2022, 23:14:51] Alex Regueiro: Right. If someone asks me about what time I'd like to live in, I usually say now, because of the modern comforts and material standards, but I concede I have great fondness for some past ways of lives, social structures, or aesthetics. Maybe it's just that life was so much simpler (in an existential sense at least).
[06/11/2022, 23:15:44] Alex Regueiro: Yep. So who knows, perhaps 20 years, perhaps 100. Very difficult to imagine it won't come eventually though (unless we completely ruin ourselves, which is always possible)
[06/11/2022, 23:16:12] Alice Lafferty: I'm really keen to draw the distinction between two concurrent phenomena: material wealth & media. Imo alienation doesn't arise from improved material comfort, it arises from media.
[06/11/2022, 23:16:13] Alex Regueiro: Social dynamics rather. Or traditions. I don't really want to live in a feudal world, even as the king!
[06/11/2022, 23:17:10] Alice Lafferty: I mean, I think it's because our lives and sense of meaning are mediated through images and narratives.
[06/11/2022, 23:17:13] Alex Regueiro: Possibly. But media (in its general sense, let's say, to encompass all mass communication within society) is a consequence of technological advances.
[06/11/2022, 23:17:29] Alex Regueiro: And media has profoundly changed our way of life, in many ways for the worse.
[06/11/2022, 23:17:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly, they come as a pair
[06/11/2022, 23:17:42] Alice Lafferty: I completely agree.
[06/11/2022, 23:18:13] Alice Lafferty: Yes I can see how smaller more closely knitted or 'thick' communities would be nicer to live in.
[06/11/2022, 23:18:18] Alex Regueiro: I haven't properly read Marshal McLuhan, but I get the impression he made some really good insights... maybe could have developed them more.
[06/11/2022, 23:18:37] Alex Regueiro: (from what people tell me)
[06/11/2022, 23:18:39] Alice Lafferty: This is basically who I'm referencing.
[06/11/2022, 23:18:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I thought so üòÄ
[06/11/2022, 23:19:06] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I was taken completely under his influence.
[06/11/2022, 23:19:11] Alex Regueiro: The "global village" is both amazingly applicable and amazingly wrong when it comes to describing the Internet.
[06/11/2022, 23:19:22] Alex Regueiro: You shall have to educate me further on his philosophy then!
[06/11/2022, 23:19:24] Alice Lafferty: I find his analysis really convincing, it really chimed with how I experience my own life.
[06/11/2022, 23:19:42] Alex Regueiro: (Or at least recommend things to read, if you'd be so kind)
[06/11/2022, 23:20:23] Alice Lafferty: Ok: what percentage of emotions you felt in the last week were triggered by real life events vs events within media, films, books etc?
[06/11/2022, 23:21:18] Alex Regueiro: One of the most worthwhile things to come out of the Frankfurt School was their analysis of mass media and its power dynamics, from what I can tell. Was that Adorno? I've only really listened to a few podcast episodes on this though
[06/11/2022, 23:21:20] Alice Lafferty: The Gutenberg Galaxy is where he writes about this particular topic.
[06/11/2022, 23:21:37] Alice Lafferty: And The Medium is the Massage.
[06/11/2022, 23:21:52] Alice Lafferty: The Global Village is the one I haven't actually read!
[06/11/2022, 23:22:09] Alex Regueiro: That's the raunchy sequel to the Medium is the Message?
[06/11/2022, 23:22:39] Alice Lafferty: I agree that's it's wrong because he misses/didn't foresee how the internet silos people into echo chambers.
[06/11/2022, 23:22:48] Alice Lafferty: No, that's the title of the book!
[06/11/2022, 23:23:12] Alex Regueiro: You wrote "massage". I was just making a cheap joke, sorry.
[06/11/2022, 23:23:20] Alice Lafferty: Yes, the title is massage
[06/11/2022, 23:23:27] Alex Regueiro: Oh it is?
[06/11/2022, 23:23:28] Alex Regueiro: My ignorance!
[06/11/2022, 23:23:31] Alex Regueiro: sorry
[06/11/2022, 23:23:43] Alice Lafferty: No, it's fine, it slips by your eye really easily.
[06/11/2022, 23:23:52] Alice Lafferty: It's a play on his famous phrase.
[06/11/2022, 23:24:36] Alex Regueiro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_Is_the_Massage#Origin_of_the_title
[06/11/2022, 23:24:41] Alice Lafferty: Haven't read Adorno either
[06/11/2022, 23:24:59] Alex Regueiro: Haha now I vaguely recall reading that! Nice little anecdote (the last paragraph)
[06/11/2022, 23:25:24] Alex Regueiro: I've made some serendipitous typos too, but that tops them all
[06/11/2022, 23:25:24] Alice Lafferty: Hm interesting? It was just an accident but people invented a story around it?
[06/11/2022, 23:25:44] Alice Lafferty: Yes!
[06/11/2022, 23:25:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, he liked it and kept the typo evidently
[06/11/2022, 23:26:47] Alex Regueiro: Good question. Hmm, maybe 70%? It would probably be lower if I didn't actively and considerably limit my consumption of news and a few other things though.
[06/11/2022, 23:26:51] Alice Lafferty: Or not echos chambers precisely, but just small 'communities'
[06/11/2022, 23:27:51] Alice Lafferty: That's pretty good.
[06/11/2022, 23:28:06] Alex Regueiro: Spot on. This is what Lasch calls the "suburbanisation" of the modern world, and he was writing in the mid 90s when the web was just being born. But in truth the internet just accelerated it; it was happening before, and in other domains of life.
[06/11/2022, 23:28:25] Alice Lafferty: I'm trying to devise a schema, like a ten-point scale, to see how media-compromised someone is.
[06/11/2022, 23:28:31] Alex Regueiro: The "suburbia" is basically an analogy to little isolated communities of like-minded people who don't engage with people who hold contrary views or challenge their ways of thinking / looking at the world.
[06/11/2022, 23:28:39] Alice Lafferty: Although it's strongly susceptible to self-misreporting.
[06/11/2022, 23:29:16] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I've heard really interesting things about Lasch, but another one I never got round to reading...
[06/11/2022, 23:29:17] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good. It may become a psychological benchmark in time! Is there anything already like that?
[06/11/2022, 23:29:36] Alex Regueiro: Also, what's your estimate for yourself?
[06/11/2022, 23:29:58] Alex Regueiro: I'm listening to the audiobook of The Revolt of the Elites currently. Friend recommended it.
[06/11/2022, 23:30:10] Alice Lafferty: Maybe this is just a feature of all human life and not an internet thing though
[06/11/2022, 23:30:31] Alex Regueiro: (and the Betrayal of Democracy)
[06/11/2022, 23:30:48] Alex Regueiro: I'd like to read The Culture of Narcissism too.
[06/11/2022, 23:31:20] Alice Lafferty: Depends. Whilst I was at university and engaging with lots of people all the time and had no leisure time, it was close to 90%.
[06/11/2022, 23:31:55] Alice Lafferty: My family went on holiday this summer for 2 weeks, I stayed behind. I think it could have dropped below 50% then.
[06/11/2022, 23:32:02] Alex Regueiro: To some extent yes. But you can study this from a mathematical (network science) point of view and look at the structure of cliques; you can quantify it. And I think objectively we're in a much worse state of fractured 'suburban' existence now than 100 years ago, or 200 years ago.
[06/11/2022, 23:32:26] Alex Regueiro: 90% is great. That's what it should be.
[06/11/2022, 23:32:41] Alex Regueiro: At least you're conscious of what effects you in that way.
[06/11/2022, 23:33:52] Alex Regueiro: affects *
[06/11/2022, 23:33:53] Alex Regueiro: damnit
[06/11/2022, 23:33:57] Alex Regueiro: schoolboy error
[06/11/2022, 23:34:10] Alice Lafferty: I kind of enjoyed it in a way because I generally like being alone more than being in company, but yes, it was weird how much of my mind was preoccupied with just, images from screens.
[06/11/2022, 23:34:53] Alice Lafferty: But pre-industrial revolution didn't people live in small villages of <2000 people?
[06/11/2022, 23:35:01] Alice Lafferty: And rarely ventured outside?
[06/11/2022, 23:35:42] Alex Regueiro: Just in the sense it's dangerous to let your emotions and mood get dictated too much by things you can't control and are fed to you by mass media. Social media is even worse, but thankfully you avoid that. It's a fine balance to be aware of what's going on in the world in an enlightened way, and to be an emotional slave to things completely outside your control. On the other hand, you can exercise a modicum of control over the people you interact with and the occasions you place yourself in.
[06/11/2022, 23:35:51] Alice Lafferty: Don't we only have the capacity to form bonds with a finite number of people?
[06/11/2022, 23:36:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, pretty much. Which is many (not all) ways was quite nice, I reckon. Even then there were a few big networks, or people who moved around a lot.
[06/11/2022, 23:36:48] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. I forget what the latest research is, but it's something like 8-10 proper friends we can have at most, right? I totally believe that.
[06/11/2022, 23:37:07] Alex Regueiro: (yay, evo psych)
[06/11/2022, 23:37:18] Alex Regueiro: And to operate in tribes of a few dozen or max 200 people, I think?
[06/11/2022, 23:37:32] Alex Regueiro: Might have been even less, like 4-6 friends.
[06/11/2022, 23:37:37] Alex Regueiro: genuine ones
[06/11/2022, 23:38:20] Alex Regueiro: It's why the notion of a friend on Facebook is kind of hilarious, especially with the people who have thousands. Or even in real life when people act like they have dozens or even hundreds of friends.
[06/11/2022, 23:43:19] Alice Lafferty: Yes, you can just 'log out' (to an extent).
[06/11/2022, 23:44:01] Alice Lafferty: 'Emotional slavery' is a really good description of my use of Twitter.
[06/11/2022, 23:44:15] Alice Lafferty: Which thankfully I've managed to kick.
[06/11/2022, 23:46:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes, surely the rest are just acquaintances. And some people (like me probably) are hypo-social and it could be fewer than that.
[06/11/2022, 23:48:10] Alex Regueiro: It had such a pernicious effect on my emotional wellbeing too. I'm sure it does with most people who use it, to various extents. Now I have an account but just for occasionally reading stuff. Thankfully I just about have enough self control not to tweet.
[06/11/2022, 23:48:15] Alice Lafferty: I also think evolutionary psychologists would say that even a village in a feudal system is too socially advanced, and that our adaptation really stopped at hunter-gathering.
[06/11/2022, 23:48:42] Alex Regueiro: Musk's takeover didn't at all tempt me to return, even if I think it's more likely to be positive than negative.
[06/11/2022, 23:49:24] Alex Regueiro: Yep, though I think a medieval village is kind of closer in its social structure to a hunter-gatherer than to a modern city or its suburbs.
[06/11/2022, 23:49:44] Alice Lafferty: Which is all very well. But I don't see them voluntarily giving up central heating, clean water, anaesthetics etc, so whatever.
[06/11/2022, 23:50:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes it's just a static form of a hunter gatherer tribe.
[06/11/2022, 23:50:10] Alex Regueiro: For sure, though I find it hard to imagine even a social butterfly having more than say a dozen true friends. We just don't have the mental capacity/wiring for it. Or time.
[06/11/2022, 23:50:50] Alex Regueiro: The agricultural revolution and advent of sedentary lifestyles is actually something I find super interesting from a social, anthropological, and genetic point of view.
[06/11/2022, 23:51:43] Alice Lafferty: I don't know much about it, I thought most of his changes were in management/ behind the scenes, rather than user experience.
[06/11/2022, 23:52:18] Alex Regueiro: I certainly wouldn't want to give them. I do think we can find a much saner sociocultural and habitational structure in the modern world though. Something more compatible with how our minds are built. Obviously our online interactions is a big component of that.
[06/11/2022, 23:52:47] Alice Lafferty: I think the consensus is that it  was extremely important, probably more so than the industrial revolution or any technology since.
[06/11/2022, 23:53:44] Alex Regueiro: For now yes, though apparently he has some things up his sleeve. Regardless, it's meant to mean less draconian policing of non-conformist and anti-the-progressive-establishment views. He's been careful not to make it a free-for-all at the same time, but it looks like woke capitalism is so strong in the US that most big companies have pulled advertising already.
[06/11/2022, 23:54:14] Alice Lafferty: Doesn't sustaining 8 billion people kind of necessitate a ruthlessly efficient/ depersonalised system?
[06/11/2022, 23:54:18] Alex Regueiro: Depends exactly what you mean by "important", but yes, it was truly a momentous stage in human history.
[06/11/2022, 23:54:31] Alex Regueiro: Maybe, but god I hope not... for my own sanity!
[06/11/2022, 23:54:49] Alice Lafferty: I mean the subjective experience of the individual the most during this transition.
[06/11/2022, 23:55:19] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that may well be the case. Hard to compare with, say, the information revolution, but still...
[06/11/2022, 23:55:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. Maybe I will check back in and see what it's like...
[06/11/2022, 23:56:48] Alex Regueiro: Part of my interest in the agricultural revolution is very personal. It's far from entirely logical, but I tend to see myself more as a descendant of those Middle Eastern peoples who began this revolution, as opposed to European hunter-gatherers or Steppe nomads!
[06/11/2022, 23:57:52] Alex Regueiro: This is Musk, in any case... who knows what he'll do, except that he's an incredibly shrewd businessman at the same time as being an eccentric multibillionaire who sometimes revels in offending people.
[06/11/2022, 23:58:17] Alice Lafferty: This is so interesting. I didn't know you had middle eastern ancestry - how far back?
[06/11/2022, 23:58:50] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I should have been clear. Only in the sense that all Europeans do, though much more so southern Europeans!
[06/11/2022, 23:59:08] Alice Lafferty: Reminds me that the story of Cain and Abel is supposed to be a dramaturgy of the traumatic break from herding culture to agriculture.
[06/11/2022, 23:59:25] Alice Lafferty: *according to one fringe theory
[06/11/2022, 23:59:35] Alex Regueiro: Middle Eastern (mainly Anatolian but also Levantine) farmers migrated to Europe beginning something like 8,000 BC, and form a large part of our deep ancestry
[06/11/2022, 23:59:43] Alice Lafferty: But it certainly happened there in the fertile crescent
[07/11/2022, 00:00:31] Alex Regueiro: But with my Italian and perhaps Spanish (albeit NW) I probably have a fair little bit of more recent ancestry from the Near East too.
[07/11/2022, 00:00:47] Alex Regueiro: But like I said, some of this self-identification is just whimsical and not particularly logical hah
[07/11/2022, 00:00:59] Alex Regueiro: Interesting, I hadn't heard that one before!
[07/11/2022, 00:01:04] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. I've seen maps of the 'out of Africa' expansion... trying to remember what the pathways were
[07/11/2022, 00:01:38] Alex Regueiro: There's some very complex movement back and forth across Eurasia and Africa to be honest
[07/11/2022, 00:02:45] Alex Regueiro: But the first expansions was probably through Sinai into the Middle East
[07/11/2022, 00:03:08] Alex Regueiro: I'd be seriously impressed if the story of Moses was a dramaturgy of that, however!
[07/11/2022, 00:03:15] Alex Regueiro: were*
[07/11/2022, 00:03:47] Alice Lafferty: This is kind of similar to what I was saying a few days ago. It's nice that you feel connected in some sense to very distant ancestry.
[07/11/2022, 00:03:55] Alex Regueiro: My haplogroup is Middle Eastern at least, though. I mean, kind of.
[07/11/2022, 00:04:37] Alice Lafferty: Believe me, there'll be a Biblical scholar who has argued exactly that.
[07/11/2022, 00:04:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Not in a way I think about often, but it's fun to muse about sometimes.
[07/11/2022, 00:04:48] Alex Regueiro: (Do you?)
[07/11/2022, 00:05:06] Alex Regueiro: üò≥
[07/11/2022, 00:06:10] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, also the insane swivel-eyed attempts to explain the resurrection, identify the flood in Genesis with a real geological event... it's a whole subfield of its own.
[07/11/2022, 00:06:57] Alice Lafferty: No, unfortunately. You've kind of planted the seed of the idea of doing 23andMe.
[07/11/2022, 00:07:10] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure my parents would be interested too.
[07/11/2022, 00:08:06] Alice Lafferty: Is that haplogroup H?
[07/11/2022, 00:10:08] Alex Regueiro: I do reckon the flood in Genesis has a much higher chance of being based on a real event, since it apparently comes from a Sumerian myth, and Sumerian civilisation is so old that the Black Sea flood event (that geologists have determined did happen) may have kept an oral memory of it. But what do I really know?
[07/11/2022, 00:10:35] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, you/they should, it would be a bit of fun. Very affordable when they go on discount too (e.g. Black Friday)
[07/11/2022, 00:10:53] Alex Regueiro: And the health stuff is useful to know too
[07/11/2022, 00:11:34] Alex Regueiro: I was thinking Y-haplogroup. T (T1a). The exact same clade as Thomas Jefferson, funnily enough, though it's extremely rare in England.
[07/11/2022, 00:12:03] Alex Regueiro: H is indeed an mt-haplogroup of Middle Eastern though. My dad has that, whereas mine is Scandinavian hunter-gatherer.
[07/11/2022, 00:12:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes, esp if you believe in a kind of Indo-European ur-mythology. Which is one theory.
[07/11/2022, 00:12:28] Alice Lafferty: Ok interesting.
[07/11/2022, 00:12:50] Alice Lafferty: It's just a DNA swab not a blood test right?
[07/11/2022, 00:13:17] Alex Regueiro: Right, though this would mean linking the Sumerians with Indo-Europeans which isn't very well-supported or popular... I think anthropologists place the origin of the Sumerians in the northern Middle East, not too far from the Black Sea potentially, whereas the proto-Indo-Europeans north of the Black Sea.
[07/11/2022, 00:13:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, just involves spitting into a tube for 5 minutes and sending that off
[07/11/2022, 00:14:14] Alice Lafferty: You know far more about this than me I think.
[07/11/2022, 00:14:31] Alex Regueiro: The earliest known sample is in present-day Israel, something like 9,000 BC, if I remember right.
[07/11/2022, 00:14:44] Alice Lafferty: You also know lots about Theology... like Arianism is hardly mainstream.
[07/11/2022, 00:15:11] Alex Regueiro: Well, historical linguistics and more recently anthropology and genetics is definitely a big interest of mine. üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 00:15:22] Alex Regueiro: I really don't. Just the faintest outlines!
[07/11/2022, 00:15:38] Alice Lafferty: Still!
[07/11/2022, 00:16:30] Alice Lafferty: This is the kind of data you're hoping to collate with the software you're working on?
[07/11/2022, 00:17:03] Alice Lafferty: Still much more than anyone else I've talked to.
‚Äé[07/11/2022, 00:17:42] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[07/11/2022, 00:18:41] Alice Lafferty: I'm not offended, it's completely true. I do it as well
[07/11/2022, 00:18:48] Alex Regueiro: And to be clear, infodumping is far from a prerogative of autistic (I do it!), and I couldn't care less whether or not you are level 1 autistic regardless. üòâ
[07/11/2022, 00:19:18] Alex Regueiro: You saw the caption at the bottom too? Ha
[07/11/2022, 00:19:40] Alice Lafferty: Wait no
[07/11/2022, 00:19:46] Alex Regueiro: Well, thank you, though I guarantee I will be exposing myself as a fraud at some point if I haven't already.
[07/11/2022, 00:19:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh, yes I do have the tendency to do this.
[07/11/2022, 00:20:24] Alex Regueiro: I mean, since you were very much info-dumping on theology (and it was very much encouraged by me). Too apt.
[07/11/2022, 00:20:49] Alice Lafferty: Sorry!
[07/11/2022, 00:20:51] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, missed this. What sort of data are you referring to here?
[07/11/2022, 00:22:08] Alex Regueiro: No no. I stress, I wilfully encouraged it, and I'm going to take that meme to heart anyway and judge it a compliment that you would "info-dump" to me. üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 00:22:29] Alice Lafferty: I mean, tracking the movement of different ethnic groups, their genetics etc.
[07/11/2022, 00:22:33] Alex Regueiro: It's kind of an ugly term, but yeah, we understand each other I think...
[07/11/2022, 00:23:51] Alice Lafferty: Yes we do, I'm slow on the uptake :(
[07/11/2022, 00:23:59] Alice Lafferty: Oh my smiley face got spliced
[07/11/2022, 00:24:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh right, no. I leave that to the academics who know what they're doing. Though there is a field called "genetic genealogy" that basically involves analysing and inferring relationships between DNA kits. Lots of amateurs who research family history do it even. I help this American guy with his software for that sometimes. It's something I occasionally use *and* he pays me to do it, so it's a really nice arrangement.
[07/11/2022, 00:24:24] Alex Regueiro: Occasionally I'll look at a paper about population genetics and history though
[07/11/2022, 00:24:36] Alex Regueiro: ü§ì
[07/11/2022, 00:24:57] Alice Lafferty: I see... so if I got my 23andMe results you could analyse our genetic proximity for example?
[07/11/2022, 00:25:11] Alex Regueiro: Yes, absolutely
[07/11/2022, 00:25:44] Alex Regueiro: For some fancy analysis you'd have to download your results and upload it to another site, but that's easy. And 23andMe tells you a lot already
[07/11/2022, 00:26:30] Alice Lafferty: By the way, I'm pretty interested by your 'recent convert Catholic friend'. There's a lot of it about... https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/opinion/nyc-catholicism-dimes-square-religion.html
[07/11/2022, 00:28:46] Alex Regueiro: Ugh, it's blocking me with a paywall. Let's see...
[07/11/2022, 00:28:57] Alice Lafferty: Ok, whose data do you use to test the software? Do people publish their full results online, or is that a privacy concern? Are the genomes of dead celebrities public? Maybe that's kind of ghoulish.
[07/11/2022, 00:29:06] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, don't worry. T
[07/11/2022, 00:29:08] Alex Regueiro: But yes, he's a guy with some interesting views and history! (His sexuality, for a start)
[07/11/2022, 00:29:14] Alice Lafferty: The article's not that interesting.
[07/11/2022, 00:30:05] Alice Lafferty: It's just that Catholicism has been extremely memetically aerodynamic over the last ~2ish years, adjacent to the general anti-progressive backlash, neo-traditionalism etc. That whole sphere.
[07/11/2022, 00:30:08] Alex Regueiro: Not full results openly, but they'll upload to public databases where you can do analyses and comparisons, and download lists of matches at different levels of granularity
[07/11/2022, 00:30:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it makes sense. Especially in Britain where the Church of England has become so insipid over the last few decades, and doesn't know where it stands for.
[07/11/2022, 00:31:47] Alice Lafferty: Ah interesting? If he's gay, then that's really nothing to write home about. The clergy always hovers around 80% homosexual men. It's an 'internalised homophobia' thing imo - kind of like 'physician heal thyself'.
[07/11/2022, 00:32:25] Alex Regueiro: I think both Catholic and Reformed congregations are growing as a consequence of this anti-progressive/neo-traditional trend. Just depends which wing you align to more. The "centre" like Anglicanism, Lutheranism, etc., seems to be losing out.
[07/11/2022, 00:32:41] Alex Regueiro: 80%? I knew it was high, but not that high, wow.
[07/11/2022, 00:32:53] Alice Lafferty: Yes, plus it's mostly US based. They want a 'cool' religion instead of the cringe evangelism they have.
[07/11/2022, 00:33:20] Alex Regueiro: Basically he thought he was gay for a few years, especially when I knew him at Oxford, but he decided it wasn't afterwards. But it coincides with him intensifying his faith, so part of me suspects there's some self-denial there. I think he could at least be bi.
[07/11/2022, 00:34:03] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. I mean, if they're moving away from the Westboro Baptist Church and the like, I suppose it's good?
[07/11/2022, 00:35:13] Alice Lafferty: To me this doesn't signify anything except that people's lives are totally capture to cultural mimesis. Militant atheism was in fashion 2000-2015, now Catholicism, which will be out a few years later...
[07/11/2022, 00:35:26] Alice Lafferty: I don't think the actual content of any of these belief systems is relevant.
[07/11/2022, 00:35:46] Alice Lafferty: It's just swapping in-group signifiers
[07/11/2022, 00:35:49] Alex Regueiro: Apparently there were some rumours flying about around the time of the Queen's death that Charles is now a committed Greek Orthodox hah. I had no idea, but these conspiracy theorist circles sound fun.
[07/11/2022, 00:35:59] Alice Lafferty: Many such cases
[07/11/2022, 00:37:49] Alice Lafferty: Yes, the CofE is trying to be everything to everybody. And so nothing to nobody.
[07/11/2022, 00:39:14] Alex Regueiro: Very much so. It's why (despite a few notable divergences), labelling the hyper-progressive i.e. woke types in the modern West as "Neo-Puritans" is fitting in my books. A few fundamental elements of their creed in common, but at some level these are just people who just love to separate themselves off into a holier-than-thou in-group and reap the corresponding benefits.
[07/11/2022, 00:40:02] Alice Lafferty: Yes it could just be personality types.
[07/11/2022, 00:41:31] Alex Regueiro: Precisely this. I've used almost those exact words myself. If they stayed largely traditional and modernised only in more measured ways, they would retain all their old crowd and still stand for something, attracting a small but at at least committed intake. Surely that's better than alienating (virtually) everyone by being a catch-all?
[07/11/2022, 00:42:02] Alice Lafferty: It's so weird how human societies are so complex to  have entirely inverted the might = right paradigm.
[07/11/2022, 00:42:44] Alice Lafferty: There just isn't this imaginary cohort of young people who are just one rainbow flag away from becoming Anglicans...
[07/11/2022, 00:43:05] Alice Lafferty: The people they're pandering to are not interested
[07/11/2022, 00:43:04] Alex Regueiro: Even if it isn't 100% that, I would bet that a very high proportion of the woke today (yes I hate that word, but we might as well use it) would be full-on Puritans/Pilgrims if they'd been nurtured by that environment.
[07/11/2022, 00:43:54] Alice Lafferty: I agree with this. General curtain-twitchers, busybodies, scolds etc.
[07/11/2022, 00:44:15] Alice Lafferty: Well, having said that some of them are well-meaning I'm sure.
[07/11/2022, 00:44:21] Alice Lafferty: That was a bit of a broad brush
[07/11/2022, 00:44:21] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. Untethered liberalism sort of has the same problem. It's not something you can really get behind and achieve a sense of belonging (which we ALL want, admit it or not).
[07/11/2022, 00:44:53] Alex Regueiro: Right. But well-meaning doesn't count for a lot unless combined with other things, let's be frank...
[07/11/2022, 00:46:01] Alice Lafferty: Another thing is that highly agreeable people (women) genuinely have trouble saying no to people's demands.
[07/11/2022, 00:47:12] Alex Regueiro: That's very true
[07/11/2022, 00:47:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes. I'm not sure whether that sense of 'belonging' can be recovered if it's not fundamentally grounded in tangibles like family and land etc.
[07/11/2022, 00:48:22] Alex Regueiro: I've also seen it argued that their high average agreeableness combined with the very high proportion of women in the social sciences these days has created a terrible academic environment! Which sounds pretty sexist at first, but there may be something to it...
[07/11/2022, 00:48:33] Alex Regueiro: 100%
[07/11/2022, 00:48:38] Alex Regueiro: At least not a health sort of belonging
[07/11/2022, 00:48:45] Alice Lafferty: I realise this sounds very right-wing by the way. I'm not particularly... I'm just trying on this political hat for a while and seeing whether I come up against any obvious problems.
[07/11/2022, 00:49:23] Alex Regueiro: It's a very recent phenomenon that our sense of belonging is so strongly tied to our political identity, and that's dangerous as hell. I allude mainly to the neo-progressives but also to some extreme conservatives.
[07/11/2022, 00:50:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes, this might be responsible for the change in academic culture, modes of enforcing norms. But not, I don't think, for the actual ideas themselves.
[07/11/2022, 00:50:16] Alex Regueiro: This is at essence why the nation state is the best "tribal" organisation or root of identity
[07/11/2022, 00:50:40] Alex Regueiro: It can of course spill over into rabid nationalism and jingoism, that's a risk, but if you look at the alternatives properly, they're all worse!
[07/11/2022, 00:50:47] Alice Lafferty: Why the nation? Isn't that already far too big and unwieldy?
[07/11/2022, 00:50:58] Alice Lafferty: Surely the small tribe is the best unit.
[07/11/2022, 00:51:26] Alex Regueiro: In some ways yes, but you need large-scale cohesion. A nation by definition shares lots of values and cultural traits which enable it to exist harmoniously for the most part.
[07/11/2022, 00:52:01] Alex Regueiro: So the size of a nation may wax and wane, they may split up and join together, but it's still the fundamental building block of cohesive and stable polities, for me.
[07/11/2022, 00:52:20] Alex Regueiro: That would make sense. Haven't thought about it in depth, but yeah
[07/11/2022, 00:52:28] Alice Lafferty: Yes. The US religious right is a bit fruitloopy
[07/11/2022, 00:52:38] Alice Lafferty: We don't really have an equivalent here, luckily
[07/11/2022, 00:53:00] Alex Regueiro: It's traditionalist more than anything. And when it comes to culture, having at least a strong respect for tradition and scepticism of rapid/radical change, is the most rational and healthiest thing, no?
[07/11/2022, 00:53:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm often grateful for that. US is kind of unique as a highly developed 1st world country. Can't think of another one.
[07/11/2022, 00:53:35] Alex Regueiro: Land of extremes, as they say. Both ways.
[07/11/2022, 00:53:50] Alice Lafferty: That's difficult for me to understand because the age we were just romanticising (pre-industrial) was actually characterised by extremely fragmented principalities and duchies etc. At least in Europe.
[07/11/2022, 00:54:03] Alice Lafferty: The nation state didn't arise until much later.
[07/11/2022, 00:54:36] Alex Regueiro: It arose in different places at different times, but it wasn't widespread (in Europe) until the 1800s, yes
[07/11/2022, 00:54:38] Alice Lafferty: US exceptionalism is real.
[07/11/2022, 00:55:02] Alice Lafferty: Go as far as to say the nation state is a product of technological progress?
[07/11/2022, 00:55:12] Alice Lafferty: And the 'alienation' therein?
[07/11/2022, 00:55:55] Alice Lafferty: Imo even the nation is an incomprehensibly large unit.
[07/11/2022, 00:56:05] Alex Regueiro: I still think that despite the big warning signs of Nazi Germany and to a lesser extent Fascist Italy (there were several other big factors at play there beyond mere nationalism), it is a remarkably stable and advantageous way of structuring politics at an international level
[07/11/2022, 00:56:11] Alex Regueiro: It is!
[07/11/2022, 00:56:56] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure about the technological aspect. Let's take England, for example. It's essentially been a nation state since the 800s AD, and even survived (and embraced) the Norman conquest.
[07/11/2022, 00:57:04] Alice Lafferty: You could be right. Maybe the US's federalism has contributed to its instability.
[07/11/2022, 00:57:16] Alex Regueiro: Some aspects of the nation concretised over time, but I still think that argument is fair
[07/11/2022, 00:57:54] Alex Regueiro: No doubt. And there are advantages to that too (preventing autocracy perhaps) but it was rightly a big point of contention in the decades following 1776.
[07/11/2022, 00:57:56] Alice Lafferty: Would someone from Cornwall have felt a strong identification with someone from Cumbria?
[07/11/2022, 00:58:04] Alice Lafferty: Although Cornwall is kind of a special case maybe
[07/11/2022, 00:58:37] Alex Regueiro: Yeah you're picking two outliers, of course, but I still think there would have been some sense of common identity and shared values, which increased over time.
[07/11/2022, 00:59:28] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough both those places still spoke dialects of the Brythonic (Celtic) language back in 800 AD, separated by swathes of English speakers!
[07/11/2022, 00:59:55] Alice Lafferty: Cornish was spoken until well into the 19th C if I'm not mistaken?
[07/11/2022, 00:59:56] Alex Regueiro: Though even they started to get integrated into some sort of Anglo-Saxon/English culture from the 600s AD, I believe
[07/11/2022, 01:00:28] Alex Regueiro: 18th C I think
[07/11/2022, 01:00:51] Alex Regueiro: And everyone was at least bilingual (or else solely English-speaking) from much earlier
[07/11/2022, 01:01:00] Alex Regueiro: It's being revived too, and I'm glad üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 01:01:24] Alex Regueiro: I don't think having a second regional language is incompatible with nationalism / the nation state.
[07/11/2022, 01:01:54] Alex Regueiro: Or indeed monoculturalism. I mean, I definitely endorse the idea of "subculturalism" (rather than multiculturalism)
[07/11/2022, 01:02:11] Alice Lafferty: Even if the nation state is a good organisational unit, it doesn't come close to resembling the 'belonging' of regional, then familial ties.
[07/11/2022, 01:02:17] Alex Regueiro: A sort of hierarchy, loosely speaking. Though not in terms of power, only identity/culture
[07/11/2022, 01:02:42] Alice Lafferty: Yes, so's Welsh I think?
[07/11/2022, 01:03:13] Alice Lafferty: Ok, this makes more sense
[07/11/2022, 01:03:36] Alex Regueiro: Yes. But these are not incompatible in my view. You will always feel the strongest bond to your immediate family and partner, after that extended families and close friends, then perhaps your town/city/region, then your country. Religion also fits in their somehow, often in line with national culture.
[07/11/2022, 01:04:06] Alex Regueiro: But as long as there is enough common ground to bind people together into a stable, cohesive society at a country level, then you have a nation
[07/11/2022, 01:04:21] Alice Lafferty: 'The family is the only level at which communism works'.
[07/11/2022, 01:04:23] Alex Regueiro: If not, maybe it makes sense to split up. (And conversely it sometimes makes sense to join together)
[07/11/2022, 01:05:01] Alice Lafferty: But in order to bind geographically disparate people, you need some kind of mass media.
[07/11/2022, 01:05:03] Alex Regueiro: There are of course other very practical motivators for large polities rather than tiny tribal ones: economic efficiency, defence, freedom of movement, etc.
[07/11/2022, 01:05:35] Alex Regueiro: Not necessarily. Well, to some extent perhaps. But it worked even in medieval nation states, didn't it? Maybe not as well as now, but still pretty effective
[07/11/2022, 01:05:58] Alex Regueiro: Haha even then, I'd argue... breakdown of parental authority can cause big trouble!
[07/11/2022, 01:06:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes definitely. I think these are more convincing than the social cohesion perspective.
[07/11/2022, 01:06:44] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, but I'd guess they were still pretty culturally fragmented.
[07/11/2022, 01:08:51] Alice Lafferty: Eg. Chaucer wrote in a specifically Cheshire dialect, and was not comprehensible to other speakers. So there were still regional languages as late as the 14C.
[07/11/2022, 01:08:53] Alex Regueiro: I don't think social cohesion is sufficient to form a nation state, but it's certainly necessary!
[07/11/2022, 01:09:44] Alex Regueiro: More so than today. There's lots of evidence for that. But I'd still describe it more as a "tree" of cultures and subcultures, just a somewhat taller one than today. It can still work though.
[07/11/2022, 01:09:53] Alice Lafferty: Also eg. the Reformation took many decades to reach more remote parts of England.
[07/11/2022, 01:10:59] Alice Lafferty: That sounds accurate
[07/11/2022, 01:11:02] Alex Regueiro: Yeah good point. I think his dialect was understandable by the vast majority of English, even Londoners. (He lived in London much of his life.) But I've heard that until the 1400s or even 1500s perhaps, Northumbrian English and say Somerset English were extremely difficult for each other to understand
[07/11/2022, 01:12:01] Alex Regueiro: Reminds me of a quote by the famous biologist (ant man) E. O. Wilson, in reference to communism. "Good ideology. Wrong species."
[07/11/2022, 01:13:10] Alex Regueiro: Yep, Lancashire was full of recusants well into the 1700s I think.
[07/11/2022, 01:13:16] Alice Lafferty: I don't really know why I'm pushing this point... I just think that the most desirable social structure is the smallish countable tribe. Maybe the nation is just the best solution, * given the circumstances of modernity *
[07/11/2022, 01:14:33] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes. I also meant that we are only capable of being truly altruistic to those we share genetics with.
[07/11/2022, 01:14:37] Alex Regueiro: I can more or less buy that. The nation state can in truth vary greatly in population and geographical extent. You can call classical Athens a nation state even. But the modern, large type? Yes, that's essentially a practicality necessitated by factors like economics, resources, defence, etc.
[07/11/2022, 01:14:53] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, and even then it can go wrong...
[07/11/2022, 01:15:42] Alex Regueiro: Love can also make you truly altruistic, or so I'm told! I can't say I've had more than a taste of it though.
[07/11/2022, 01:16:28] Alex Regueiro: The parent-child bond, though, which is from one perspective so irrational, is probably the ultimate form of altruism
[07/11/2022, 01:16:40] Alice Lafferty: You must have towards your family? Do you mean romantic love specifically?
[07/11/2022, 01:16:47] Alex Regueiro: I meant romantic in that case
[07/11/2022, 01:16:58] Alex Regueiro: To the extent parents may sacrifice their lives for their children in extreme cases
[07/11/2022, 01:17:29] Alex Regueiro: Even then, surely not as strong as parent-child. The genetic link really does matter!
[07/11/2022, 01:17:35] Alice Lafferty: Yes, but even that if you look under the hood is basically selfish because the child is the vessel of your DNA...
[07/11/2022, 01:18:32] Alice Lafferty: As far as I can tell, romantic love seems incredibly fickle and brittle. Romantic love is selfish and parental love is selfless, something like that...
[07/11/2022, 01:18:43] Alice Lafferty: I do overuse the ellipse...
[07/11/2022, 01:19:04] Alex Regueiro: Selfish from one perspective. I've grappled with that issue before. But because I think your biology and neurology is fundamentally part of who you are, your intrinsic nature (to some extent you have no choice), I don't think it's "selfish" in any substantive sense.
[07/11/2022, 01:19:14] Alex Regueiro: ... not as much as me...
[07/11/2022, 01:20:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly. I'm not convinced that romantic bonds are 'real', or at least, not anywhere near to the extent we've been led to believe.
[07/11/2022, 01:20:17] Alex Regueiro: I've heard that distinction before too, but I suspect the two sorts of love, although clearly quite different, are closer in nature than that suggests.
[07/11/2022, 01:20:31] Alex Regueiro: Equally, I agree it's far more brittle/fickle than familial love.
[07/11/2022, 01:21:22] Alice Lafferty: This is a nicer way to think about it!
[07/11/2022, 01:22:35] Alice Lafferty: Haha, maybe, I actually remember my mum telling me she felt 'jealous' of other people holding her children when we were infants.
[07/11/2022, 01:22:50] Alice Lafferty: So maybe it has that element of possessiveness too.
[07/11/2022, 01:23:24] Alex Regueiro: I think it's as real as any other emotion. But it's also a mental illness of sorts, as some have said! I think even Plato used words to that effect. üòâ
[07/11/2022, 01:24:09] Alex Regueiro: Aw. Yes, I imagine that's pretty common actually. There's probably a possessive aspect to all love.
[07/11/2022, 01:24:57] Alice Lafferty: I had romantic infatuations, in my early teens especially, that could be described like that. But now they seem so obviously insubstantial?
[07/11/2022, 01:25:29] Alex Regueiro: So did I...
[07/11/2022, 01:25:30] Alice Lafferty: I'm skeptical about the longevity of romantic bonds.
[07/11/2022, 01:25:32] Alice Lafferty: If they exist
[07/11/2022, 01:26:33] Alice Lafferty: Haha. Puberty is one hell of a drug.
[07/11/2022, 01:26:34] Alex Regueiro: Even when it's not a complete infatuation, as it shouldn't be in adulthood, I still think it's a mental illness of sorts. I remember reading something by a psychiatrist saying that similar brain activity patterns can be observed in people deeply in love and schizophrenics, or something like that!
[07/11/2022, 01:26:44] Alex Regueiro: God yes. I hated mine, overall.
[07/11/2022, 01:26:56] Alice Lafferty: I read something like cocaine addicts?
[07/11/2022, 01:27:51] Alice Lafferty: Well, when I look at my parents, there doesn't seem to be much of that. It seems like a kind of platonic fondness.
[07/11/2022, 01:27:51] Alex Regueiro: It's only natural. I fluctuate, but I'd probably agree more often than not. I just tell myself now: try and see. I try not to hold high expectations nor be a defeatist about it.
[07/11/2022, 01:28:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, that's the one. Drug addicts.
[07/11/2022, 01:28:15] Alice Lafferty: They've been married for 21 years.
[07/11/2022, 01:28:16] Alex Regueiro: Cocaine addiction can cause schizophrenia, of course, but you're quite right!
[07/11/2022, 01:28:39] Alex Regueiro: I think that's probably the healthiest and most stable, enduring form for a marriage
[07/11/2022, 01:28:40] Alice Lafferty: But like I'm loath to speculate too much about my parents' relationship obviously.
[07/11/2022, 01:28:43] Alex Regueiro: i.e. after the first few years
[07/11/2022, 01:28:57] Alex Regueiro: Haha who wants to think about that indeed?
[07/11/2022, 01:29:10] Alex Regueiro: I'd probably say the same of mine, and they've been married 35 years now
[07/11/2022, 01:29:44] Alice Lafferty: To be honest existence of polygyny kind of destroyed my belief in monogamous romantic love.
[07/11/2022, 01:30:22] Alice Lafferty: Wow
[07/11/2022, 01:31:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah I forgot that you're 32
[07/11/2022, 01:32:13] Alice Lafferty: I think so. Not glamorous.
[07/11/2022, 01:33:11] Alex Regueiro: Well, the sex drive of men is kind of conducive to polygyny, isn't it? But I don't think wanting to "sow one's wild oats" must preclude love. It's worth noting that psychological-hormonal changes occur in men as well as women when they fall in love, that "binds" them and makes them more loyal. Of course, it's clearly a very error-prone mechanism!
[07/11/2022, 01:33:14] Alex Regueiro: at least in some folks
[07/11/2022, 01:33:36] Alex Regueiro: Regardless, polyamory has a much worse track record than monoamory (is that a word?)
[07/11/2022, 01:34:00] Alex Regueiro: Thanks for the reminder. üòí
[07/11/2022, 01:34:33] Alice Lafferty: Not only higher libidos, but also crucially greater desire for variety in sexual partners.
[07/11/2022, 01:34:49] Alice Lafferty: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect
[07/11/2022, 01:35:37] Alice Lafferty: Becoming emotionally bonded to one single woman seems contradictory to the male mating strategy.
[07/11/2022, 01:36:14] Alex Regueiro: It doesn't seem to appealing when you're looking at potential partners or falling in love, but I think it's a good thing after all. Almost reassuring.
[07/11/2022, 01:37:03] Alex Regueiro: I've always thought a deep friendship with whomever I loved would be really important.
[07/11/2022, 01:37:05] Alex Regueiro: Okay, not always
[07/11/2022, 01:38:02] Alex Regueiro: But it's sort of the foundation. You need attraction and romance too, obviously, but without the former the flame would burn bright and quick, would it not?
[07/11/2022, 01:38:45] Alice Lafferty: I completely agree. I think just as a result of my temperament, my terminal value in nearly every decision is basically: security. But in general, novelty is attractive. Divorce rates bear this out.
[07/11/2022, 01:39:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly.
[07/11/2022, 01:39:55] Alex Regueiro: I think this is a risk of extrapolating too much from other animals. Men have every reason to invest in their partner, to stay loyal. For the development of their children of course, but also for division of labour, and looking after each other. Can't underestimate emotional security!
[07/11/2022, 01:40:16] Alex Regueiro: It's like taking out an insurance policy on your feelings, if you want to put it as dismally as possible.
[07/11/2022, 01:41:04] Alice Lafferty: For a long time I thought about just trying to pursue an essentially non-sexual marriage-style of relationship, but I didn't know how to present the idea properly.
[07/11/2022, 01:41:18] Alex Regueiro: Yep. It's really just the variation in personality traits like affinity for novelty/adventure and a few others that determine whether someone is a loyal partner, I'd say.
[07/11/2022, 01:41:20] Alice Lafferty: Exactly
[07/11/2022, 01:41:41] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. Are you still favouring that?
[07/11/2022, 01:42:07] Alice Lafferty: I think humans are almost the only mammal in which the father invests in his offspring.
[07/11/2022, 01:42:40] Alice Lafferty: Bluntly, males prioritise quantity of offspring over quality.
[07/11/2022, 01:42:42] Alex Regueiro: At least the only primate, yep! Chimps are terrible that way haha. Maybe that video I linked you to explains, I forget.
[07/11/2022, 01:42:55] Alice Lafferty: Kind of like, just shoot as many darts as board as possible and who cares where they end up
[07/11/2022, 01:43:21] Alex Regueiro: For most species, yep. And that instinct isn't totally gone in humans, but it's definitely much diminished, take solace in that.
[07/11/2022, 01:44:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes I lost that in the WhatsApp chat, I will scroll back up to find it
[07/11/2022, 01:45:26] Alice Lafferty: Yes, probably impulse-control too.
[07/11/2022, 01:45:33] Alex Regueiro: It's weird, I've never at all felt like the stereotypical man in that one respect. I'm not even trying to convince you or anyone here. Just saying the "sow your wild oats" concept was always a bit foreign to my mind.
[07/11/2022, 01:45:40] Alex Regueiro: definitely
[07/11/2022, 01:46:13] Alex Regueiro: And hedonism. I mean, whether you get your pleasure from purely sensory things or the so-called 'higher' pleasures.
[07/11/2022, 01:46:53] Alice Lafferty: I guess if I was in a monogamous relationship, I would essentially feel I was forcing the man to do something against his will.
[07/11/2022, 01:47:12] Alice Lafferty: Love not freely given is kind of worthless.
[07/11/2022, 01:47:47] Alex Regueiro: I'm still curious about this, if you don't mind saying...
[07/11/2022, 01:48:23] Alice Lafferty: Haha even though you're somewhat incentivised to say this about yourself...! But no, I believe you.
[07/11/2022, 01:48:51] Alex Regueiro: Aha good, because it is true!
[07/11/2022, 01:48:52] Alice Lafferty: There's a huge variety.
[07/11/2022, 01:49:11] Alice Lafferty: * of personality types, relationship styles etc.
[07/11/2022, 01:49:15] Alex Regueiro: I think it's genetic too. My maternal grandfather was totally like that.
[07/11/2022, 01:50:45] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely. Of course, there are different definitions of freedom, but if either side feels constrained in some way, it's a recipe for it falling apart or someone playing away from home.
[07/11/2022, 01:51:49] Alice Lafferty: Well, I had given up trying to find a man who was sexually attracted to me and who would marry me on that basis. So instead I would try to find someone I was good friends with, propose getting married and living together (thereby avoiding stigma, having company, security etc), but just have an uncomplicated, strictly platonic relationship.
[07/11/2022, 01:52:22] Alex Regueiro: Appreciate the honesty üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 01:52:24] Alice Lafferty: There would be no expectation on my part of 'being in love' and going through all the motions socially.
[07/11/2022, 01:52:37] Alex Regueiro: I think that's pretty sensible
[07/11/2022, 01:52:51] Alice Lafferty: Also probably what most marriages end up like eventually anyway!
[07/11/2022, 01:52:56] Alice Lafferty: I was just speedrunning it
[07/11/2022, 01:52:57] Alex Regueiro: No reason it can't work in theory. I've heard the Japanese do it more and more these days!
[07/11/2022, 01:53:27] Alex Regueiro: A woman will often look at marrying her best male friend if she hits 30 and hasn't fallen in love still
[07/11/2022, 01:53:53] Alex Regueiro: Haha that's a good way of putting it
[07/11/2022, 01:54:59] Alice Lafferty: I like the idea of having an insoluble legal bond with someone. Like just a few days ago I forgot my keys and was locked out of my house. And I sort of thought about how if I lived alone, I would have been in real trouble.
[07/11/2022, 01:55:38] Alice Lafferty: But obviously my parents were there... so just to replace that kind of reliability and comfortableness I have from my parents (but reciprocally of course)
[07/11/2022, 01:56:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah. I actually managed to lock myself out so often when I was a teenager that I got my parents to hide a spare key somewhere in the front yard. Once I think I had to stand around outside shivering for over an hour!
[07/11/2022, 01:56:03] Alice Lafferty: Is that the case? I haven't heard of that
[07/11/2022, 01:56:52] Alice Lafferty: I imagine that happens a fair amount? I don't really know anybody that age though.
[07/11/2022, 01:57:01] Alice Lafferty: And besides what if her best friend does not want to marry her?
[07/11/2022, 01:57:26] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Not sure it's what most do, but it's still amazingly common these days, I read. Who knows if it will work in the long run heh. Japan has big problems with its birth rate and age profile.
[07/11/2022, 01:57:28] Alice Lafferty: Me too, it invariably happens at least once a month still.
[07/11/2022, 01:57:44] Alice Lafferty: Oh, I was thinking of S Korea maybe
[07/11/2022, 01:58:23] Alice Lafferty: Yes they have the upside down triangle of doom.
[07/11/2022, 01:58:28] Alex Regueiro: It obviously relies on consent, but I think there's sort of a norm / mutual understanding that's developing.
[07/11/2022, 01:58:46] Alex Regueiro: Not heard that before but I know what you mean heh
[07/11/2022, 01:58:57] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I mentioned Japan originally, but didn't connect my comments properly
[07/11/2022, 01:59:43] Alice Lafferty: True of all highly developed nations generally
[07/11/2022, 01:59:51] Alex Regueiro: Hah, no shame in my book. I tend to do it whenever I go out to exercise or play sport and leave my keys in my regular trousers!
[07/11/2022, 02:00:35] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, though this phenomenon of marrying your best friend at a certain age seems fairly unique to Japanese culture, as far as I know. Maybe we should adopt it in the West too?
[07/11/2022, 02:01:03] Alex Regueiro: There are some weird-as-hell sides to Japanese romantic/sexual culture though
[07/11/2022, 02:01:20] Alice Lafferty: I know people make those 'pacts': 'if we're not both married at 30...' but they're usually not serious right?
[07/11/2022, 02:01:21] Alex Regueiro: So I wouldn't RUSH to emulate them!
[07/11/2022, 02:01:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I've heard of them, but don't know if anyone's actually followed through on it!
[07/11/2022, 02:02:18] Alice Lafferty: I know... what is the term for a kind of 'cultural xenophobia' ? I find something kind of disturbing at the heart of Japanese culture.
[07/11/2022, 02:02:18] Alex Regueiro: Probably Hollywood lying to us yet again...
[07/11/2022, 02:02:25] Alice Lafferty: Not the people per se, or anything
[07/11/2022, 02:03:36] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it sounds like the plot of a romantic comedy.
[07/11/2022, 02:03:37] Alex Regueiro: It's a very strange culture in our eyes, I agree... not sure I'll ever fully get it. I ask my (female) Japanese friend about it sometimes.
[07/11/2022, 02:04:27] Alex Regueiro: Coming back to this... have you really not found many guys who were attracted to you? Or just a matter of not the ones you were attracted to?
[07/11/2022, 02:05:42] Alice Lafferty: No, none really.
[07/11/2022, 02:06:08] Alice Lafferty: I understand this is really unusual for a young woman.
[07/11/2022, 02:06:11] Alex Regueiro: What happened with your romantic infatuations as a teenager, for example? Presuming they weren't with celebrities or fictional guys!
[07/11/2022, 02:06:31] Alex Regueiro: (Sorry if this is too personal, feel free to ignore it. You've just gotten me curious.)
[07/11/2022, 02:07:30] Alice Lafferty: Oh a good deal of them were with fictional characters, or my teachers.
[07/11/2022, 02:07:36] Alex Regueiro: It's certainly rare, but I've got maybe two women friends like this actually, and it's much more a factor of their personality (shyness, having very atypical interests, ...)
[07/11/2022, 02:07:41] Alice Lafferty: You have to remember I went to an all-girl's school.
[07/11/2022, 02:07:44] Alex Regueiro: ... than looks
[07/11/2022, 02:08:01] Alice Lafferty: They were all very much from afar.
[07/11/2022, 02:08:01] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I just remembered as I wrote that. Until 6th form, right?
[07/11/2022, 02:08:22] Alice Lafferty: It's ok. It's quite funny to look back on now!
[07/11/2022, 02:08:55] Alex Regueiro: Good! For me too, mainly. I mean, marginally awkward or depressing, but I mainly laugh at my immaturity and raging teenage hormones ha.
[07/11/2022, 02:09:11] Alice Lafferty: But men do not romantically approach women based on their 'personalities'.
[07/11/2022, 02:09:47] Alex Regueiro: No, but say, if you're in the same school, they'll have a good idea of your general personality even they don't speak to you.
[07/11/2022, 02:10:00] Alex Regueiro: Also, and perhaps more so, SO much can be conveyed through body language.
[07/11/2022, 02:10:17] Alex Regueiro: Like shyness/introversion/confidence for one.
[07/11/2022, 02:10:23] Alex Regueiro: I speak from personal experience in part
[07/11/2022, 02:10:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes. The shyness/avoidance had gotten very bad by that point (when I changed schools). I hardly spoke to anyone, let alone a boy. My school attendance was only ~50%
[07/11/2022, 02:11:06] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. Did you just bunk because you felt super awkward at school?
[07/11/2022, 02:11:09] Alice Lafferty: I believe that some men might be responsive to signals of sexual openness yes.
[07/11/2022, 02:11:13] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure you were strong academically
[07/11/2022, 02:11:21] Alice Lafferty: And in some cases that might supersede physical attractiveness.
[07/11/2022, 02:11:35] Alice Lafferty: But I've done some experiments wit this.
[07/11/2022, 02:11:57] Alex Regueiro: It means a lot. And for women looking at men, things like confidence, how you hold yourself, your social status among peers... that stuff counts for a lot.
[07/11/2022, 02:12:20] Alex Regueiro: Alas, while not giving a shit about what my peers thought of me for the most part was nice in many ways, it didn't help with the girls!
[07/11/2022, 02:12:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh, tell me. Now I'm super curious heh
[07/11/2022, 02:12:44] Alice Lafferty: Yes just terribly socially inhibited. The social stakes got much higher in a mixed sex environment and I couldn't deal with it.
[07/11/2022, 02:13:07] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[07/11/2022, 02:13:17] Alex Regueiro: Obviously clothes can give strong signals too, though in school that's a bit limited...
[07/11/2022, 02:14:31] Alice Lafferty: I went to a bar every Friday in increasing levels of promiscuous dress.
[07/11/2022, 02:14:43] Alice Lafferty: To measure the effect of sexual openness signals.
[07/11/2022, 02:15:07] Alice Lafferty: And I have to say it made no difference whatsoever, nobody spoke to me on any occasion.
[07/11/2022, 02:15:17] Alice Lafferty: So I had to conclude that my dress was not a factor.
[07/11/2022, 02:16:07] Alice Lafferty: I realise this isn't 'normal'. This 'incident' was actually included in my autism diagnosis write-up.
[07/11/2022, 02:17:03] Alex Regueiro: Wow
[07/11/2022, 02:17:18] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I find that kind of impressive!
[07/11/2022, 02:17:29] Alex Regueiro: Maybe it's just my commitment to the scientific method...
[07/11/2022, 02:17:41] Alex Regueiro: But still
[07/11/2022, 02:17:45] Alice Lafferty: Plus there's just loads of evidence on this, statistical and anecdotal.
[07/11/2022, 02:18:05] Alex Regueiro: Was this a bar in London? Cambridge?
[07/11/2022, 02:19:11] Alice Lafferty: Yes but it was also kind of pathological, I see now.
[07/11/2022, 02:19:57] Alex Regueiro: It's far from normal behaviour, that's for sure. Probably not helpful for your mental well-being in some way (I couldn't say), but from an empirical-scientific perspectively sensible! üòâ
[07/11/2022, 02:20:19] Alice Lafferty: St Alban's actually. Very crowded.
[07/11/2022, 02:20:47] Alice Lafferty: Put average of clientele at ~23.
[07/11/2022, 02:21:16] Alex Regueiro: Several guys your age, presumably?
[07/11/2022, 02:21:20] Alex Regueiro: Guessing 18
[07/11/2022, 02:21:36] Alice Lafferty: 19 by then but yeah.
[07/11/2022, 02:23:06] Alex Regueiro: I didn't really do anything like this rigorously myself. Like, no control variables. But I have sort of varied my personality (as much as humanly possible for someone who isn't a sociopath) and seen how it affects interactions with women. And even men a bit (not romantically). I kind of did it naturally at some point. Over a fairly long timescale.
[07/11/2022, 02:23:11] Alice Lafferty: I think basically that perceived sexual openness does increase sexual attractiveness, but only for those who already meet a minimum physical standard.
[07/11/2022, 02:23:23] Alice Lafferty: Oh interestingv
[07/11/2022, 02:23:26] Alex Regueiro: Wasn't with the same people! Or they might have thought I had multiple personality disorder hah.
[07/11/2022, 02:23:45] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I hope I didn't vary it *that* much...
[07/11/2022, 02:24:13] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. Surely you got approached at least once or twice by the end though? Just not enough of a sample size?
[07/11/2022, 02:24:39] Alice Lafferty: Ah that means the control variables are not the same. Had the same sort of issue in my experiment
[07/11/2022, 02:25:03] Alice Lafferty: No, 0 times.
[07/11/2022, 02:25:20] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's a really awful experiment from a scientific perspective, but it was the best I could do informally in our crazy-complex world.
[07/11/2022, 02:25:47] Alex Regueiro: I'm sorry. That must have really hit your self esteem.
[07/11/2022, 02:26:02] Alice Lafferty: I thought about repeating it and actually approaching men myself but that would have been a step too far.
[07/11/2022, 02:26:59] Alice Lafferty: It's ok! Don't feel sorry for me, the vast majority of women find it at worst threatening and at best annoying when men approach them!
[07/11/2022, 02:27:07] Alex Regueiro: Just to be clear, this was a bar or pub? And when you say you were dressing promiscuously by the end, I'm imagining a fairly short skirt, low-cut top, and brightish colours?
[07/11/2022, 02:27:37] Alex Regueiro: It very much depends who approaches them! (There's a well-known meme about this which you've probably scene.)
[07/11/2022, 02:28:13] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah, that would introduce other variables too, which might spoil the results.
[07/11/2022, 02:28:46] Alice Lafferty: It was some horrible Weatherspoons actually. Yes, normal jeans and coat, then just increasingly shorter dresses.
[07/11/2022, 02:29:17] Alex Regueiro: And when you started I picture you dressing even more conservatively than in your OKC profile pics heh.
[07/11/2022, 02:29:22] Alice Lafferty: Yes true
[07/11/2022, 02:29:40] Alice Lafferty: But tell me about the results of your experiment?
[07/11/2022, 02:29:49] Alex Regueiro: scene? SCENE? Bloody hell, my mind must be shutting down.
[07/11/2022, 02:29:58] Alex Regueiro: (Which I thought were nice, but then I'm a total weirdo so...)
[07/11/2022, 02:30:11] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I make typos like that all the time, don't worry
[07/11/2022, 02:30:15] Alice Lafferty: It its 2:30am!
[07/11/2022, 02:30:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I'm sure it's because all my language abilities are auditory! (Apparently they're more visual for some.)
[07/11/2022, 02:31:09] Alice Lafferty: I think I had one picture on my OKC profile where I was wearing quite a short skirt actually. The rest were just normal clothes.
[07/11/2022, 02:31:59] Alice Lafferty: Hm interesting I've never heard of this distinction before
[07/11/2022, 02:32:33] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. The results are more anecdotal than statistical, but feigning confidence (obviously not going for conceitedness) had a positive correlation on attention. Some other things like outgoingness (at least when I tried too much) had a negative correlation, probably because people, especially women, have a sense for it being inauthentic.
[07/11/2022, 02:33:27] Alex Regueiro: But putting on a confident veneer is surprisingly effective. I think it very much helped me become genuinely confident with time. (Well, in certain ways at least.)
[07/11/2022, 02:33:46] Alice Lafferty: Hm interesting... seems like the distinction between confidence and outgoingness is only a very fine one?
[07/11/2022, 02:33:54] Alice Lafferty: Assume the confidence was genuine then?
[07/11/2022, 02:33:56] Alex Regueiro: I think when some people read/write they use the visual cortex at least in part. But when speaking/listening no.
[07/11/2022, 02:34:03] Alice Lafferty: As that was not picked up as inauthentic.
[07/11/2022, 02:34:43] Alice Lafferty: 'Fake it till you make it', that's what they say.
[07/11/2022, 02:34:46] Alex Regueiro: No, maybe because it's not really about changing your personality type / style, but just enhancing what you already have? That's the sense I meant it.
[07/11/2022, 02:34:56] Alex Regueiro: Does that make sense?
[07/11/2022, 02:35:06] Alex Regueiro: And it was only slightly. Incrementally
[07/11/2022, 02:35:09] Alex Regueiro: hah yes
[07/11/2022, 02:35:22] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes.
[07/11/2022, 02:35:42] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I think they're often confused or even overlap. But I distinguish them in my mind at least.
[07/11/2022, 02:35:47] Alice Lafferty: Did you try out anything else?
[07/11/2022, 02:36:00] Alice Lafferty: And have you implemented the results in your every day life?
[07/11/2022, 02:36:55] Alex Regueiro: BTW, I remember being utterly astounded reading a story about some monk in the Early Middle Ages who could read silently, and this was thought to be a most incredible and supernatural ability!
[07/11/2022, 02:37:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes, Anselm
[07/11/2022, 02:37:19] Alex Regueiro: I knew you'd know the one
[07/11/2022, 02:37:22] Alex Regueiro: thank you üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 02:37:33] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[07/11/2022, 02:37:57] Alex Regueiro: the early Archbishop of Canterbury, right?
[07/11/2022, 02:38:09] Alice Lafferty: Or is that story from Augustine....
[07/11/2022, 02:38:18] Alice Lafferty: It may have been Ambrose
[07/11/2022, 02:38:21] Alice Lafferty: :s
[07/11/2022, 02:38:44] Alice Lafferty: Which is about 1000 years earlier
[07/11/2022, 02:38:52] Alex Regueiro: Ambrose or Augustine time frame sounds more likely... or maybe too early? Sounds like a Dark Ages thing heh
[07/11/2022, 02:38:56] Alice Lafferty: Pft.
[07/11/2022, 02:39:22] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to go with your initial one for now, and remain impressed
[07/11/2022, 02:39:31] Alice Lafferty: There are so many famous quotes from the Augustine-Ambrose relationship... it's likely to be one of those.
[07/11/2022, 02:39:47] Alice Lafferty: That's very gracious of you, although I'm quite sure now that it is wrong.
[07/11/2022, 02:40:36] Alex Regueiro: Not really. Some has been inevitable maturation. In terms of appearance I tried to start caring more about it over time, but it's really come in fits and starts. (For years I just didn't care about attracting the opposite sex.)
[07/11/2022, 02:41:27] Alex Regueiro: You'll probably wake up in the middle of the night now and suddenly recall it.
[07/11/2022, 02:41:50] Alice Lafferty: Men's physical appearance hardly matters above a baseline of hygiene and grooming.
[07/11/2022, 02:42:00] Alex Regueiro: And again, there's only so much I can do about appearance
[07/11/2022, 02:42:20] Alex Regueiro: I think you underestimate appearance for men. You're right to some extent, but... well, we already sort of discussed this
[07/11/2022, 02:43:38] Alice Lafferty: I'm quite sure that it's Ambrose. It would be insanely late for Anselm to have been the first to discover silent reading. Sorry about that. This information only really got stored in my short-term memory when I was in lectures I think. I'm surprised how much of it is gone from just 6 months ago.
[07/11/2022, 02:43:46] Alex Regueiro: One of the things you can't really play with experimentally is nerves. And unfortunately that can be a huge hindrance!
[07/11/2022, 02:44:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it makes more sense with timeframe, it just also surprises me a little because this is pre-Dark Ages and the Romans were plenty literary.
[07/11/2022, 02:44:34] Alex Regueiro: might be apocryphal of course
[07/11/2022, 02:44:47] Alice Lafferty: Well there are some things like height and general build, but I think that's only because they are themselves related to status. So I think it's a second order effect.
[07/11/2022, 02:45:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Or at least to physical prowess, which obviously meant a lot back in hunter-gatherer days, but very little now.
[07/11/2022, 02:45:53] Alice Lafferty: Very likely. Ambrose is also purported to have said 'When in Rome.. (do as the Romans do)'. And some others.
[07/11/2022, 02:46:06] Alice Lafferty: To Augustine.
[07/11/2022, 02:46:20] Alice Lafferty: But it's no longer believed that that originates with him, apparently.
[07/11/2022, 02:46:57] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[07/11/2022, 02:47:11] Alex Regueiro: I read a blog about by a woman about this once, saying that by all rights her sex should find the stereotypical nerdy or 'dweeby' phenotype (can I call it that?) attractive in the 20th/21st C, but, you know, evolution just hasn't quite caught up yet.
[07/11/2022, 02:47:40] Alex Regueiro: Not surprised
[07/11/2022, 02:48:12] Alice Lafferty: Was I dressed too conservatively on my OKC profile?
[07/11/2022, 02:48:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh no. I only read said it because you mentioned it yourself at one point.
[07/11/2022, 02:48:49] Alice Lafferty: I doubt it will. Because of medicine and monogamy, there are no selection pressures.
[07/11/2022, 02:48:57] Alex Regueiro: Slightly on the conservative side (except for the one with the skirt maybe?) but only slightly
[07/11/2022, 02:49:37] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Not that it would have made a difference anyway (as I showed in my experiment).
[07/11/2022, 02:49:49] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. So men and women will probably continue to make terrible choices of mate for thousands more years to come, based on outdated hardwired criteria! üòâ
[07/11/2022, 02:50:19] Alex Regueiro: You said it was your aim to be look on the conservative side, right? Or do I misremember?
[07/11/2022, 02:50:50] Alice Lafferty: Yes, although I don't see why the men's choices are terrible. It's literally just youth and fertility.
[07/11/2022, 02:51:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's not necessarily as outdated. Although again, modern medicine/tech means their priorities are perhaps slightly skewed the wrong way?
[07/11/2022, 02:51:44] Alice Lafferty: Well, it was
[07/11/2022, 02:52:17] Alex Regueiro: Honestly it didn't particularly cross my mind when I was looking.
[07/11/2022, 02:52:22] Alex Regueiro: Several other things did, but not that
[07/11/2022, 02:52:45] Alex Regueiro: It stands out when a girl looks particularly loose, but that's it I'd say
[07/11/2022, 02:53:10] Alex Regueiro: or even just 'wild' heh
[07/11/2022, 02:53:18] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, that male preference will probably die hard
[07/11/2022, 02:53:23] Alice Lafferty: HA
[07/11/2022, 02:53:52] Alex Regueiro: Probably. Or 'live hard'. Only time shall tell.
[07/11/2022, 02:54:08] Alice Lafferty: Is this bait to get me to ask what they were...
[07/11/2022, 02:54:31] Alex Regueiro: It wasn't meant that way hah. But feel free to ask if you're curious.
[07/11/2022, 02:54:47] Alice Lafferty: Or, I do realise it's very late again, so sorry if I'm keeping you up.
[07/11/2022, 02:55:35] Alex Regueiro: I'm not hugely tired, believe it or not. Even with the odd silly thing I'm typing.
[07/11/2022, 02:56:07] Alex Regueiro: Please feel free to say goodbye if you are, however!
[07/11/2022, 02:56:18] Alex Regueiro: I'd understand perfectly
[07/11/2022, 02:56:33] Alice Lafferty: Do you have an irregular sleep schedule?
[07/11/2022, 02:56:37] Alice Lafferty: I know I do
[07/11/2022, 02:57:37] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it varies and it's not the best. I might as well tell you now, I have a condition where my circadian clock is longer than 24 hours and it really messes with my schedule. üôÉ
[07/11/2022, 02:57:46] Alex Regueiro: significantly longer, that is
[07/11/2022, 02:58:19] Alice Lafferty: It's my absolute darling temptation to get feedback on my actions... but I will resist it.
[07/11/2022, 02:58:50] Alice Lafferty: You're kidding, I have that as well.
[07/11/2022, 02:58:58] Alice Lafferty: Non-24 hour sleep-wake rhythm?
[07/11/2022, 02:59:22] Alex Regueiro: Hah, good self-restraint. You can always find out some other time, perhaps when less is at stake?!
[07/11/2022, 02:59:41] Alex Regueiro: Oh gosh, really?
[07/11/2022, 03:00:19] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I can't get to sleep at the same time every night.
[07/11/2022, 03:00:43] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. It's either that or DPSD, which have very similar symptoms
[07/11/2022, 03:01:02] Alice Lafferty: And it eventually cycles through to sleeping during the day and then back to the night etc. It's bad. I believe circadian disruption is a carcinogen.
[07/11/2022, 03:01:41] Alice Lafferty: I've been experimenting with exposure/avoidance to daylight at different times.
[07/11/2022, 03:01:47] Alex Regueiro: Jetlag coming back from Argentina on top of that screwed with me so much. I'd go from something like 2:30 to 11:30 to 4:00 within 3 nights!
[07/11/2022, 03:01:58] Alex Regueiro: Melatonin definitely helps me at least
[07/11/2022, 03:02:13] Alex Regueiro: That too. Though only to an extent. And, you know, English winter...
[07/11/2022, 03:02:38] Alice Lafferty: Ah, that sounds bad.
[07/11/2022, 03:02:47] Alice Lafferty: At least you don't have to get up for a 9-5
[07/11/2022, 03:03:33] Alice Lafferty: Did you bring that back with you from the US or EU? I don't think it's available in the UK.
[07/11/2022, 03:03:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it is. At least too little sleep is. They say that's what gave Thatcher cancer and alzheimer's!
[07/11/2022, 03:04:18] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it was not fun. I was also ill. (Seems to always happen when I return from holidays.)
[07/11/2022, 03:04:23] Alex Regueiro: Thankfully a little better now
[07/11/2022, 03:04:28] Alice Lafferty: Ha yeah I've heard that as well... although plenty of people get Alzheimer's 'anyway'
[07/11/2022, 03:04:40] Alex Regueiro: You're right, it's over-the-counter in the US. But I got a prescription for it here.
[07/11/2022, 03:05:00] Alex Regueiro: True. Sample size of one doesn't mean a lot! Though I think there's a few other famous anecdotes?
[07/11/2022, 03:05:33] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. Have to book an appointment with my GPüòí
[07/11/2022, 03:05:51] Alex Regueiro: Trump sleeps very little too, apparently. Any resulting mental deterioration in his case will be very hard to detect, however.
[07/11/2022, 03:06:56] Alice Lafferty: Yes... it doesn't really make sense that sleep and wakefulness are triggered by day/night cycles because they vary so much throughout the year?
[07/11/2022, 03:07:38] Alice Lafferty: Biden may already be a victim.
[07/11/2022, 03:07:49] Alex Regueiro: Not if you want constancy like in the modern world, yeah. Though if you just need to be active in the day and dormant at night, pretty much works?
[07/11/2022, 03:08:11] Alice Lafferty: I mean, it's dark for 16 hours in the winter. Nobody's sleeping that long though.
[07/11/2022, 03:08:33] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Might just be age in his case. But I think the US has just set a record for a (first world) country with a leader of such poor mental faculty
[07/11/2022, 03:09:17] Alex Regueiro: True, though I just meant a loose correlation, not a strict correspondence
[07/11/2022, 03:09:21] Alice Lafferty: When were you in Argentina then?
[07/11/2022, 03:09:55] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I didn't buy the dementia arguments during the election, but his mental acuity for much of his time in office has been pretty concerning. The handshake with the invisible guy, etc.
[07/11/2022, 03:10:08] Alice Lafferty: Aren't planes bacteria incubators?
[07/11/2022, 03:10:08] Alex Regueiro: Couple of weeks from late September to early October
[07/11/2022, 03:10:51] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. Sorry to hear you were ill, I couldn't tell when we met
[07/11/2022, 03:11:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes. I guess his staff are basically running the country and just wheel him out for speeches.
[07/11/2022, 03:11:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, terrible ones, I'm sure. Was so busy and out-and-about (way too much for my liking) it must have weakened my defences, and the germ-ridden plane sealed the deal.
[07/11/2022, 03:11:57] Alex Regueiro: Ah no, I was all better by then. üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 03:12:24] Alex Regueiro: That's the impression I get... though I'm not super on top of current affairs, for the sake of my sanity. Been that way a while.
[07/11/2022, 03:12:55] Alice Lafferty: Same.
[07/11/2022, 03:13:17] Alice Lafferty: Anyway re the circadian rhythm issues, do you try setting alarm clocks?
[07/11/2022, 03:13:26] Alex Regueiro: Wise you are!
[07/11/2022, 03:13:41] Alice Lafferty: Forcing yourself to wake up at the same time theoretically means you get tired at the same time.
[07/11/2022, 03:13:52] Alex Regueiro: I do. I even have a fancy sleep app that's meant to wake you up at the "right" time (which I should start using again)
[07/11/2022, 03:13:57] Alice Lafferty: It doesn't always work in practice but it's often better than nothing.
[07/11/2022, 03:14:14] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, I've read this too, and other things about sleep hygiene, as they call it
[07/11/2022, 03:14:36] Alex Regueiro: But they also admit that people with these disorders can basically end up living on permanent jetlag that way. Fun fun.
[07/11/2022, 03:14:49] Alex Regueiro: I still try a bit
[07/11/2022, 03:15:17] Alice Lafferty: :(
[07/11/2022, 03:15:22] Alex Regueiro: Light and exercise definitely help to some extent
[07/11/2022, 03:15:31] Alex Regueiro: How long have you had your condition?
[07/11/2022, 03:16:14] Alice Lafferty: Now that I have no real schedule I just get sleep when I can. To be fair it's usually a good 8 hours every 24 hours, just at eccentric times, so I don't feel the loss particularly.
[07/11/2022, 03:17:15] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure... I always struggled to get to sleep and often went to school with very little sleep. I'd say it developed in my teens. You?
[07/11/2022, 03:17:26] Alex Regueiro: Here's a really nerdy anecdote: I actually downloaded my genome results from my DNA test and looked for a couple of polymorphisms for sleep disorders that have been proposed in papers!
[07/11/2022, 03:17:33] Alex Regueiro: Result: negative/inconclusive
[07/11/2022, 03:17:49] Alex Regueiro: The same, mid-late teens I'd say
[07/11/2022, 03:18:03] Alice Lafferty: Haha not nerdy particularly it seems quite sensible.
[07/11/2022, 03:18:30] Alex Regueiro: Nerdy in that I had to install some specialist bioscience software hah
[07/11/2022, 03:19:19] Alice Lafferty: Maybe they haven't identified all of the genes involved yet?
[07/11/2022, 03:19:19] Alex Regueiro: but yeah, looking after your health is sensible, eh?
[07/11/2022, 03:19:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, these things are really complex. Surely controlled by a bunch of genes.
[07/11/2022, 03:19:51] Alex Regueiro: It's pretty early days in sleep science still, I understand
[07/11/2022, 03:20:44] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, I did want to ask earlier... in general terms, what were your immediate turn-offs/dealbreakers when looking at men's profiles?
[07/11/2022, 03:21:24] Alice Lafferty: It's funny because I'm not a hypochondriac or a particular purist when it comes to diet but I really enjoy tracking my health metrics.
[07/11/2022, 03:21:27] Alice Lafferty: It's just fun.
[07/11/2022, 03:21:56] Alice Lafferty: Haha are you trying to harvest information from me to apply to future interactions?
[07/11/2022, 03:22:20] Alex Regueiro: This is purely curiosity as to what your benchmarks are and how your mind works! Nothing to do with me... I evidently didn't have any dealbreakers, right?
[07/11/2022, 03:22:26] Alex Regueiro: Not at all haha
[07/11/2022, 03:22:39] Alex Regueiro: You can stick purely to profiles, not men in general!
[07/11/2022, 03:23:11] Alex Regueiro: You don't have to answer, I just thought it's kind of fun to laugh about these things
[07/11/2022, 03:23:40] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I get you. I've never been overly concerned about health either, but my genetic health report was fascinating.
[07/11/2022, 03:25:24] Alex Regueiro: I'll start even. They/them pronouns is a dealbreaker and putting she/her is a definite mark in the minus column!
[07/11/2022, 03:25:35] Alice Lafferty: Well, a good detailed profile mainly. All sections filled out, grammatically correct sentences, punctuation, some interest beyond 'travelling' or 'gaming'. You might be surprised how rare that is.
[07/11/2022, 03:26:07] Alice Lafferty: I don't have any 'benchmarks' per se. I can't afford to be choosy in any case.
[07/11/2022, 03:26:46] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[07/11/2022, 03:27:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that makes total sense. I know guys are meant to judge mainly by looks, but if I see an almost empty profile I conclude it's probably because she's looking for a hookup heh.
[07/11/2022, 03:28:20] Alice Lafferty: Shirtless pictures are rarely well-received.
[07/11/2022, 03:28:28] Alice Lafferty: Even if the man is in good shape.
[07/11/2022, 03:28:33] Alice Lafferty: It's just kind of vain.
[07/11/2022, 03:28:38] Alex Regueiro: Mr. Evo Psych is very annoyed with you right now.
[07/11/2022, 03:28:53] Alex Regueiro: Mrs, even
[07/11/2022, 03:29:21] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's fair too
[07/11/2022, 03:29:38] Alice Lafferty: I know... I've actually managed to reason myself out of female selectiveness.
[07/11/2022, 03:30:04] Alice Lafferty: It can be done if you're clear-eyed about your situation.
[07/11/2022, 03:30:25] Alex Regueiro: I tell myself the same thing, but I'm naturally too choosy for a guy, and Mr. Evo Psych is telling me not to be
[07/11/2022, 03:31:58] Alice Lafferty: By the way, I hope you don't interpret that to mean that you're like an option that only an indiscriminate person would choose.
[07/11/2022, 03:32:13] Alice Lafferty: That's not what I mean, and I don't think that at all.
[07/11/2022, 03:32:14] Alex Regueiro: No, I didn't think that at all
[07/11/2022, 03:32:16] Alex Regueiro: ...but now I do!
[07/11/2022, 03:32:20] Alice Lafferty: I was surprised that you matched with me.
[07/11/2022, 03:32:21] Alex Regueiro: (kidding)
[07/11/2022, 03:32:41] Alex Regueiro: Honestly? That's really nice of you to say.
[07/11/2022, 03:33:17] Alex Regueiro: And it's going to seem fawning now, but I thought the same
[07/11/2022, 03:33:20] Alice Lafferty: And remember, I had to ask you if you wanted to go out on a date, which is another inversion of the usual way.
[07/11/2022, 03:33:35] Alex Regueiro: You did!
[07/11/2022, 03:33:37] Alice Lafferty: I'm kind of embarrassed about that
[07/11/2022, 03:33:55] Alex Regueiro: Embarassed in this case or you generally find it embarrassing?
[07/11/2022, 03:34:41] Alex Regueiro: To be honest I just wasn't prepared to think about it yet. The great majority of women want to chat more online and wait longer before going out even on a casual first date.
[07/11/2022, 03:34:55] Alice Lafferty: It's in general a bit embarrassing.
[07/11/2022, 03:35:16] Alex Regueiro: I sort of set a timer of 3-4 days from when we start chatting haha
[07/11/2022, 03:35:24] Alex Regueiro: Even though I'd prefer cutting to the chase!
[07/11/2022, 03:35:40] Alice Lafferty: I know, I just jumped the gun because I had had some conversations that went on for simply weeks without ever resulting in a date.
[07/11/2022, 03:35:44] Alex Regueiro: So, thank you for pre-empting on that. I really appreciated the directness
[07/11/2022, 03:36:25] Alex Regueiro: I see. Were they pretty frequent/long or just sporadic messages spread out across weeks?
[07/11/2022, 03:36:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes it's just easier.
[07/11/2022, 03:36:37] Alex Regueiro: the latter is a guaranteed way to kill interest I find
[07/11/2022, 03:37:28] Alex Regueiro: But hey, at least I did the rest after you asked. Would have been rude (unmanly?) not to!
[07/11/2022, 03:37:29] Alice Lafferty: Fairly frequent for 1-2 weeks. I think they were just talking to me when bored.
[07/11/2022, 03:37:44] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I've definitely got that impression from some women too.
[07/11/2022, 03:38:30] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes that's true
[07/11/2022, 03:38:35] Alex Regueiro: One of the things I hate about online dating. So many people treat it like a diversion, like watching Youtube. They pick it up when they find themselves twiddling their thumbs and put it down when their attention gets diverted
[07/11/2022, 03:39:09] Alice Lafferty: I think that's absolutely true.
[07/11/2022, 03:39:40] Alice Lafferty: I guess it's fun talking to strangers, you get an ego boost when you get a match etc.
[07/11/2022, 03:40:04] Alice Lafferty: I think OKC is a little more serious than some of the others though.
[07/11/2022, 03:40:05] Alex Regueiro: Online dating is a bit like postgraduate applications, I found. You get rejected by all the ones you think are sure bets and get accepted out of the blue by one you thought was out of your league!
[07/11/2022, 03:40:24] Alex Regueiro: That's my particular experience with master's applications, admittedly!
[07/11/2022, 03:40:34] Alice Lafferty: Haha that is an interesting comparison...
[07/11/2022, 03:40:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it is. It's not like Tinder.
[07/11/2022, 03:40:58] Alice Lafferty: Reminds me of my university application too, I got into Cambridge but got rejected by Exeter :s
[07/11/2022, 03:41:16] Alex Regueiro: Yep, for sure. Even I'll concede that. But some people are even worse, doing it purely for an ego trip.
[07/11/2022, 03:41:24] Alex Regueiro: Haha impressive
[07/11/2022, 03:41:32] Alex Regueiro: I got accepted by Oxford and rejected by the University of Washington
[07/11/2022, 03:41:55] Alice Lafferty: ??
[07/11/2022, 03:42:01] Alice Lafferty: They were too good for you were they
[07/11/2022, 03:42:10] Alex Regueiro: So it seems
[07/11/2022, 03:42:39] Alex Regueiro: Columbia waitlisted me as well
[07/11/2022, 03:42:59] Alex Regueiro: And they're a rung above Washington
[07/11/2022, 03:43:11] Alice Lafferty: Do those universities have particularly prestigious maths/science departments..
[07/11/2022, 03:43:38] Alex Regueiro: Still, I think all the blessed saints (in which I don't believe) every day I didn't end up studying in the US.
[07/11/2022, 03:44:07] Alice Lafferty: Why? Expensive? It looks kind of fun?
[07/11/2022, 03:44:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Maths/comp sci programmes.
[07/11/2022, 03:44:13] Alice Lafferty: Or the campus culture?
[07/11/2022, 03:44:43] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[07/11/2022, 03:45:36] Alex Regueiro: Partly cost, partly just US culture repels me more and more as I get older. And I concede it's quite varied, but we both know what type exists in universities there...
[07/11/2022, 03:47:22] Alex Regueiro: And yes, I thought US campus life would be fun when I was younger. Even if you're not a footloose fun-loving promiscuous type... but there are plenty of downsides too, I know now
[07/11/2022, 03:47:28] Alex Regueiro: Why, do you like the idea of studying at a US university?
[07/11/2022, 03:47:46] Alice Lafferty: I do understand why you asked this by the way. People love talking about dating because it gets really close to the heart of issues about your social rank and general worth as a person.
[07/11/2022, 03:49:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I find it interesting from a personal and intellectual perspective.
[07/11/2022, 03:49:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes. If it's any consolation, I would say that the 25-40 year old staff at Cambridge are far more """woke""" than the student body. As we were saying earlier, there's a bit of a backlash.
[07/11/2022, 03:49:42] Alex Regueiro: Plus, it sort of confirmed what sort of person I thought you were.
[07/11/2022, 03:50:01] Alex Regueiro: Not in terms of how you look at me, but how you evaluate people more generally üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 03:50:30] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I've heard that too. Also, good work with the triple double quotes ahah
[07/11/2022, 03:50:49] Alice Lafferty: I thought about going to one of the smaller liberal arts colleges in the NE for a while. Went on holiday to Boston and really liked it there. Glad now I didn't though. I wouldn't have coped that well.
[07/11/2022, 03:51:33] Alex Regueiro: Bristol wasn't much different, and I had a good time there overall. US culture in general though is so superficial, individualistic, and about the pursuit of happiness (ü§¢)
[07/11/2022, 03:51:47] Alex Regueiro: Never been, but people always told me I'd love Boston.
[07/11/2022, 03:53:05] Alex Regueiro: FYI if I seem rather prejudiced against the US, I know actually the country pretty well and have a lot of admiration for it in other ways. I'll tell you about my family connections with America another time.
[07/11/2022, 03:53:09] Alice Lafferty: I'm worried that through our conversations I've come across as an absolutely heartless relationship-utilitarian.
[07/11/2022, 03:54:02] Alice Lafferty: I think you would.
[07/11/2022, 03:54:18] Alice Lafferty: Haha yep
[07/11/2022, 03:54:23] Alice Lafferty: Ok :)
[07/11/2022, 03:54:23] Alex Regueiro: Cope with the campus lifestyle, or what?
[07/11/2022, 03:54:44] Alice Lafferty: More, moving alone to a foreign country.
[07/11/2022, 03:55:39] Alex Regueiro: I don't think you judged me for it, but I say that just because I like making sardonic jokes about the US (among other nations) and one or two people have taken it badly before. So a caveat is handy.
[07/11/2022, 03:55:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's not easy
[07/11/2022, 03:56:40] Alex Regueiro: I have a suspicion the American campus lifestyle would have been too outgoing for your liking too, though obviously that's a bit of a stereotype.
[07/11/2022, 03:57:07] Alice Lafferty: I'm not that judgemental. Earlier I made a borderline racist statement about Japan (I've never even been there, I've just picked stuff up from the internet).
[07/11/2022, 03:58:16] Alice Lafferty: You're probably right. British drinking culture can rival it though sometimes.
[07/11/2022, 03:58:19] Alex Regueiro: I didn't judge you for that either. I've heard from many sources, Japanese and Gaijin alike, that the Japanese can often be pretty xenophobic!
[07/11/2022, 04:00:02] Alex Regueiro: That's true. One of the several things I'm happy to criticise about British culture when it takes my fancy.
[07/11/2022, 04:00:49] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I feel like I've taken up too much of your time. I can't believe it's 4:00am.
[07/11/2022, 04:01:11] Alice Lafferty: I feel like only very recently I noted in a message it was 2:30am
[07/11/2022, 04:05:06] Alice Lafferty: Also apologies if I 'overshared' at all.
[07/11/2022, 04:05:31] Alex Regueiro: Hah don't worry. I didn't expect your very objective third-party assessment of it all, but it was really interesting. And it's not like you somehow transcend your humanity and lock away your emotions when it comes to your own relationships. üòä
[07/11/2022, 04:05:39] Alex Regueiro: You read my mind
[07/11/2022, 04:06:38] Alex Regueiro: I was literally planning to reply to that message then tell you I'm knackered and need some sleep at last! How time has flown...
[07/11/2022, 04:07:07] Alice Lafferty: I'm really keen to defend my experience because that 'men have low standards' and 'all women can easily enter our relationship' are such pervasive cultural ideas.
[07/11/2022, 04:07:17] Alice Lafferty: Sorry!
[07/11/2022, 04:08:00] Alex Regueiro: They are. And there's a kernel of truth in them, but I think we both know it's exaggerated and there's also huge variation within the sexes! We might both be outliers heh.
[07/11/2022, 04:10:31] Alice Lafferty: I preferred to do it like that because you know, whilst we are discussing dating, it's like a meta-conversation because we ourselves are actually going on dates... so I didn't know how to conduct myself there.
[07/11/2022, 04:10:57] Alex Regueiro: Hah, I'm going to have to stamp this compulsive apologising out of you, you know! As very British and very nice of you it is.
[07/11/2022, 04:11:03] Alex Regueiro: I just want you to relax as much as possible and not worry about the decisions I make.
[07/11/2022, 04:11:37] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I'll go now, if you feel tired you should definitely take advantage of it.
[07/11/2022, 04:12:35] Alex Regueiro: Yep I get that. I like everything meta (just not Meta), and likewise what I say at a meta-level often doesn't describe how I function
[07/11/2022, 04:13:11] Alex Regueiro: Hope you feel tired very soon too. Good night! Was lovely chatting.
[07/11/2022, 20:50:04] Alex Regueiro: Hey Alice
[07/11/2022, 20:50:20] Alex Regueiro: Did you get a good night's/day's sleep in the end?
[07/11/2022, 21:59:07] Alice Lafferty: Hello
[07/11/2022, 21:59:39] Alice Lafferty: Yes I slept maybe 4:30am ish to midday? How about you?
[07/11/2022, 22:01:10] Alice Lafferty: By the way I listened again to the Shostakovich & Rachmaninoff symphonies in question and I'd like to see them on the 12th. What do you think?
[07/11/2022, 22:04:09] Alex Regueiro: Ah that's not too bad. Similar for me, maybe slightly later on both counts. (Realised I was pretty hungry after we stopped chatting!)
[07/11/2022, 22:04:56] Alex Regueiro: Okay great. They both sound like really nice concerts, so I'm open
[07/11/2022, 22:18:08] Alice Lafferty: I also listened to e lucevan le stelle, I thought it was really beautiful.
[07/11/2022, 22:18:40] Alice Lafferty: Although it's a good thing I don't understand the Italian. The lyrics are so soppy it would have spoiled it for me.
[07/11/2022, 22:18:54] Alice Lafferty: But maybe I'm not entering into the spirit of the opera properly.
[07/11/2022, 22:19:46] Alice Lafferty: Ok that's goodüëç
[07/11/2022, 22:20:02] Alice Lafferty: I don't know about you but I tend to graze at random hours instead of eating three meals a day.
[07/11/2022, 22:21:05] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I'm somewhat similar. I'll have two proper meals typically but the rest will be grazing
[07/11/2022, 22:21:14] Alex Regueiro: üêÆ
[07/11/2022, 22:22:30] Alex Regueiro: Glad you liked it. I don't remember the lyrics, but I'm you're surely right. That's just most of opera to be honest. It's very rare when the lyrics or even plot match the quality of music
[07/11/2022, 22:23:18] Alex Regueiro: I can understand bits and pieces of the words, but a) my Italian is very basic, b) opera can be really hard to understand even for natives.
[07/11/2022, 22:26:31] Alice Lafferty: I think jury's still out on which eating pattern is best for metabolic health.
[07/11/2022, 22:27:54] Alice Lafferty: Yes when listening I just treat the voice as another instrument which doesn't have semantic content
[07/11/2022, 22:28:14] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of given me more of a reason to go and see Tosca though.
[07/11/2022, 22:28:26] Alice Lafferty: I'll just avoid reading the English translations
[07/11/2022, 22:29:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I don't particularly follow that stuff anyway. I'm definitely closer to the "bovine way" than intermittent fasting or anything like that however. Even if it does prolong your life slightly, as they claim, I'm pretty sure the decline in quality of life isn't worth it.
[07/11/2022, 22:31:43] Alex Regueiro: You have exactly the right idea as far as I'm concerned. I also remember that in most cases the composer didn't write the tripe that is the libretto...
[07/11/2022, 22:32:27] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. If every slice of bread I ate shortened my life by one hour it still would have been worth it.
[07/11/2022, 22:32:28] Alex Regueiro: It's nice to have a vague idea of the plot perhaps, but you definitely don't need to follow every word. Some lines are repeated so much anyway that it's mind-numbing
[07/11/2022, 22:32:54] Alex Regueiro: every word... or any word, arguably!
[07/11/2022, 22:34:13] Alice Lafferty: Yeah except Wagner maybe?
[07/11/2022, 22:34:31] Alex Regueiro: I'd make an Italian hand gesture, but alas you cannot see me
[07/11/2022, 22:34:43] Alex Regueiro: one of approval, of course
[07/11/2022, 22:34:48] Alice Lafferty: ü§å
[07/11/2022, 22:35:05] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. I was thinking of another one, but that works too.
[07/11/2022, 22:35:43] Alex Regueiro: You take away my pizza pie-a, you take away my life-a!
[07/11/2022, 22:36:24] Alice Lafferty: So and so falls in love with so and so, who is actually someone else in a disguise. People are killed in a duel. Then the remaining characters jump into the Arno as part of a suicide pact.
[07/11/2022, 22:36:24] Alex Regueiro: Yep, he certainly did. I really need to see a Wagner at some point. Some are brutally long, but there's some great music, and it's not sappy drivel.
[07/11/2022, 22:36:41] Alex Regueiro: What do you mean you don't know opera? You're clearly an expert.
[07/11/2022, 22:38:00] Alex Regueiro: This is probably my favourite bit of Wagner that I know (no words!)
[07/11/2022, 22:38:01] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXh5JprKqiU
[07/11/2022, 22:38:21] Alex Regueiro: I might be biased because it's used in the film Excalibur
[07/11/2022, 22:38:49] Alice Lafferty: Haha my favourite film of all time
[07/11/2022, 22:39:03] Alex Regueiro: It's magical, isn't it?
[07/11/2022, 22:39:03] Alice Lafferty: I think I really only know Tristan and Isolde?
[07/11/2022, 22:39:14] Alice Lafferty: It was also used in the film Melancholia
[07/11/2022, 22:39:16] Alex Regueiro: Quite literally and metaphorically
[07/11/2022, 22:39:43] Alex Regueiro: I've not seen a lot of Lars von Trier, but I really should
[07/11/2022, 22:40:15] Alice Lafferty: I think it has the best set & costume design of pretty much any film I can think of
[07/11/2022, 22:40:16] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes. I just know one or two bits from that (and the plot, sort of?)
[07/11/2022, 22:41:12] Alex Regueiro: The Ring Cycle is meant to be his crowning glory though. That piece, Sigfried's Funeral March, is from G√∂tterd√§merung, which is the last of the cycle I think.
[07/11/2022, 22:41:13] Alice Lafferty: I've only seen Melancholia. I don't particularly rush out to recommend it to anyone. It's quite good if you're in a depressive episode.
[07/11/2022, 22:41:45] Alex Regueiro: It's certainly up there. Great atmosphere and cinematography too.
[07/11/2022, 22:41:45] Alice Lafferty: And I'm not really interested in watching his more pornographic ones
[07/11/2022, 22:42:28] Alice Lafferty: Yes, that is the extremely long one too?
[07/11/2022, 22:42:54] Alex Regueiro: Like Nymphomaniac? Haven't seen it but it comes across like a pretentious porn film indeed.
[07/11/2022, 22:43:12] Alex Regueiro: "The extremely long one" doesn't narrow it down much with Wagner, but probably!
[07/11/2022, 22:43:45] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I'm too much of a prude
[07/11/2022, 22:43:51] Alex Regueiro: Have you seen Barry Lyndon? That's really up there in that department too... and in others.
[07/11/2022, 22:44:11] Alice Lafferty: True sorry. I really don't know much about him.
[07/11/2022, 22:44:25] Alex Regueiro: I'm just teasing
[07/11/2022, 22:44:28] Alice Lafferty: I haven't, is that.... Scorsese...
[07/11/2022, 22:44:41] Alex Regueiro: I'll bring one of those fancy Puritan hats for you when we see each other
[07/11/2022, 22:45:43] Alice Lafferty: Wait no!
[07/11/2022, 22:45:44] Alex Regueiro: Kubrick. Though funnily enough Scorcese named it as (possibly) his favourite film, so I'm in good company. Honestly, you really must see it. It can polarise people a little but I hold out hope you'll really enjoy it.
[07/11/2022, 22:45:46] Alice Lafferty: I mean stanley kubrick
[07/11/2022, 22:46:26] Alice Lafferty: I knew it wasn't like a Mafia film. I am so bad with names...
[07/11/2022, 22:46:44] Alice Lafferty: Ambrose, Anselm, Stanley, Scorsese...
[07/11/2022, 22:46:57] Alex Regueiro: Scorcese has done other types of films too, of course, but yeah it's not quite his style. (Scorcese is a genius too in my book, but not quite as versatile.)
[07/11/2022, 22:47:44] Alex Regueiro: St Scorcese of Milan sounds like a brilliant theologian to be fair.
[07/11/2022, 22:49:19] Alice Lafferty: I once talked confidently for 15 minutes to a teacher about  Oliver Cromwell being executed by Henry VIII.
[07/11/2022, 22:49:35] Alice Lafferty: In an A-level pre-screening interview.
[07/11/2022, 22:49:49] Alex Regueiro: haha brilliant
[07/11/2022, 22:50:06] Alex Regueiro: To get into the St Albans school?
[07/11/2022, 22:50:45] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I have seen Dr Strangelove (him, yes??) but I'll try to see Barry Lyndon too if you recommend it so strongly.
[07/11/2022, 22:50:54] Alex Regueiro: Oliver, Thomas... they're both similar bastards
[07/11/2022, 22:51:10] Alex Regueiro: Yep! Did you like Dr Strangelove?
[07/11/2022, 22:51:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[07/11/2022, 22:51:36] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much everything he made is a work of art in my view
[07/11/2022, 22:51:44] Alice Lafferty: I did
[07/11/2022, 22:51:52] Alex Regueiro: But 2001 and Barry Lyndon are his best, followed by Strangelove maybe
[07/11/2022, 22:52:05] Alex Regueiro: Then I'm even more impressed that you got accepted despite that.
[07/11/2022, 22:52:13] Alice Lafferty: I know how highly regarded he is.. film is just one (of many) areas I'm kind of undereducated in.
[07/11/2022, 22:52:40] Alex Regueiro: It's no shame. But I can help educate you, if you're keen. üôÇ
[07/11/2022, 22:53:17] Alice Lafferty: Honestly it wasn't that competitive. It gave me really strong 'I wouldn't want to be a part of any club that would have someone like me as a member' syndrome.
[07/11/2022, 22:53:25] Alex Regueiro: Kubrick and Kurosawa are my favourite directors, though Hitchcock and Scorcese aren't too far behind.
[07/11/2022, 22:54:34] Alice Lafferty: I actually like Hitchcock a lot, maybe the best out of the four you mentioned. I really liked The Lady Vanishes.
[07/11/2022, 22:54:44] Alex Regueiro: That's a perfectly self-consistent maxim though. I only interviewed for getting into secondary school, but I had the weird experience of flunking the 11+ but getting accepted into both (fairly selective) private schools my parents applied to.
[07/11/2022, 22:55:20] Alex Regueiro: You can't go wrong with him. We were both born in Leystonstone too, so I claim that!
[07/11/2022, 22:55:25] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, trying to remember that film
[07/11/2022, 22:55:55] Alice Lafferty: I guess you've seen The Third Man? Not Hitchcock but kind of similar in some ways... I really enjoyed that too.
[07/11/2022, 22:56:24] Alice Lafferty: Huh weird?
[07/11/2022, 22:56:28] Alex Regueiro: Kubrick and Kurosawa can be a bit artsy so that puts some off, but it's not art for art's sake, and not pretentious. Their films are full of character and great plots. Fellini on the other hand... üò¨
[07/11/2022, 22:56:42] Alice Lafferty: They didn't interview you at 11 or something?
[07/11/2022, 22:56:55] Alex Regueiro: They did interview, for the private schools. Not 11+ of course
[07/11/2022, 22:57:14] Alice Lafferty: Some London private schools have insane entry processes for students who are basically little children.
[07/11/2022, 22:57:45] Alice Lafferty: Haha. Did he make La Dolce Vita?
[07/11/2022, 22:57:46] Alex Regueiro: Basically it was down to time pressure. I was ridiculously slow (methodical and meticulous, I say) so I only finished about 70% of the exam. I was kind of unpracticed too.
[07/11/2022, 22:58:02] Alice Lafferty: Or have I got that wrong as well?
[07/11/2022, 22:58:06] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's mad. 11 is really the earliest age you can have a proper entrance exam for
[07/11/2022, 22:58:27] Alex Regueiro: I don't think I've actually seen The Lady Vanishes, but it's now on my list.
[07/11/2022, 22:58:39] Alex Regueiro: nope you're right
[07/11/2022, 22:59:04] Alex Regueiro: That might be one of his less bad ones, I don't recall. But 8 1/2 is the most overrated film of all time in my books
[07/11/2022, 22:59:20] Alice Lafferty: So how were you accepted to the schools? See my canny parents had gotten me a tutor to prep me for the 11+ exams.
[07/11/2022, 22:59:32] Alex Regueiro: There are lots of really good (mainly old) Italian films, but Fellini didn't make any of them in my books.
[07/11/2022, 23:00:04] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I almost forgot, I love Bergstrom too. Probably Kubrick, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Bergstrom, Scorcese, in that order.
[07/11/2022, 23:00:17] Alice Lafferty: That appears a lot on 'best of' lists.
[07/11/2022, 23:00:37] Alice Lafferty: I remember it as being quite light-hearted.
[07/11/2022, 23:01:34] Alex Regueiro: That's super common these days I gather. (My mum teaches primary school students, in case I didn't mention.) In my day it was pretty rare unless you were a bit slow, I hate to say... or your parents were ridiculously rich. A lot changed in 8 or 10 years. These days I hear even the super bright kids get tutored, unless their parents aren't well off.
[07/11/2022, 23:01:55] Alex Regueiro: Hitchcock is the master of mood. He can do light-hearted or very tense equally well.
[07/11/2022, 23:01:59] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I've seen anything by Kurosawa or Bergstrom, but I'm going to look them up now
[07/11/2022, 23:02:12] Alex Regueiro: Exactly, and it always baffles me
[07/11/2022, 23:03:21] Alice Lafferty: Yes. It's one of those things where if just a few people do it then suddenly everyone has to in order to be competitive.
[07/11/2022, 23:03:36] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. And I can recommend specific films if you like. I know we're in the middle of planning something, but occasionally they screen these old films at BFI Southbank, so maybe I could drag you along...
[07/11/2022, 23:03:46] Alex Regueiro: A few are really worth seeing that way
[07/11/2022, 23:03:48] Alex Regueiro: on the big screen
[07/11/2022, 23:04:14] Alex Regueiro: Yep I think this is what happened, it became a trend.
[07/11/2022, 23:05:05] Alice Lafferty: Ok :) what is your favourite Bergstrom movie then?
[07/11/2022, 23:06:05] Alex Regueiro: Jesus, I just realise I butchered his name
[07/11/2022, 23:06:10] Alex Regueiro: what a philistine I look like
[07/11/2022, 23:06:10] Alice Lafferty: By the way my mum is quite similar, she works as a special needs coordinator at primary schools.
[07/11/2022, 23:06:11] Alex Regueiro: BergMAN
[07/11/2022, 23:06:16] Alex Regueiro: sorry
[07/11/2022, 23:06:17] Alex Regueiro: ha
[07/11/2022, 23:06:36] Alice Lafferty: I did look up Bergstrom and it came up with a clothing brand
[07/11/2022, 23:06:56] Alex Regueiro: I just substituted a random stereotypical Swedish surname suffix
[07/11/2022, 23:06:57] Alice Lafferty: It's ok, I'm having a malign influence on you.
[07/11/2022, 23:07:04] Alex Regueiro: Fail... as they say
[07/11/2022, 23:07:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh, nice. I have the utmost respect for people who do that. (Met a few.) I think I'd go mad pretty quickly though. I didn't really enjoy tutoring even average-intelligence secondary school students.
[07/11/2022, 23:07:59] Alice Lafferty: I've done that like 3 times just today.
[07/11/2022, 23:08:49] Alice Lafferty: Yes she has the patience of a saint.
[07/11/2022, 23:08:55] Alex Regueiro: Bergman films: The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries are two of the famous ones and possibly his best
[07/11/2022, 23:09:01] Alice Lafferty: Ingmar?
[07/11/2022, 23:09:06] Alex Regueiro: yup
[07/11/2022, 23:09:12] Alice Lafferty: Wait I have heard of him then.
[07/11/2022, 23:09:29] Alex Regueiro: No relation to Ingrid Bergman, who married Roberto Rossellini (famous Italian neorealist director)
[07/11/2022, 23:10:13] Alice Lafferty: I've actually seen Autumn Sonata.
[07/11/2022, 23:10:26] Alex Regueiro: Did you like it?
[07/11/2022, 23:10:39] Alice Lafferty: But she acted in that film I think?
[07/11/2022, 23:10:49] Alex Regueiro: Yes she did heh
[07/11/2022, 23:11:05] Alex Regueiro: They worked together, as they were both really famous Swedes in film, but no relation...
[07/11/2022, 23:11:31] Alex Regueiro: Fanny and Alexander is a great film too (and nothing to do with my name)
[07/11/2022, 23:12:14] Alice Lafferty: It was quite a while ago. I watched it with my mum actually so my experience is strongly overlayed with her reaction to it.
[07/11/2022, 23:12:52] Alex Regueiro: I keep forgetting great directors. Sergio Leone has to be in my top 5 too. Err, but now I have 6 in my top 5. We'll have to overlook that.
[07/11/2022, 23:12:53] Alice Lafferty: It definitely got under my skin
[07/11/2022, 23:13:16] Alex Regueiro: Yep, Bergman films can really do that. They're kind ofthe opposite of feel-good films.
[07/11/2022, 23:13:17] Alice Lafferty: Do you like Nicholas Roeg?
[07/11/2022, 23:13:39] Alex Regueiro: Sombre, somewhat depressing, in a stereotypical Swedish way
[07/11/2022, 23:13:45] Alex Regueiro: I don't know him I'm afraiid
[07/11/2022, 23:13:48] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[07/11/2022, 23:15:01] Alex Regueiro: Ooh, he worked on The Masque of the Red Death. One of my favourite Vincent Price films
[07/11/2022, 23:15:22] Alice Lafferty: I like him a lot, and his films are similar to Bergman's, Autumn Sonata at least. Working in the 70s, and they both share a kind of dryness if you know what I mean.
[07/11/2022, 23:15:44] Alice Lafferty: I haven't seen it sorry! I'm making another list...
[07/11/2022, 23:16:20] Alex Regueiro: The old horror films (minimal gore, thankfully) of Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, and Peter Cushing are mainly wonderful
[07/11/2022, 23:16:51] Alex Regueiro: It looks like I have seen some of Roeg's films. The Witches is one. Really liked that as a child.
[07/11/2022, 23:17:06] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, wish I could be a better conversationalist, about this and lots of other things.
[07/11/2022, 23:17:11] Alex Regueiro: And The Man Who Fell to Earth (David Bowie). I like that too.
[07/11/2022, 23:17:42] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. You're merely deficient in years to be a film buff yet, but you can remedy that easily in due course. üôÇ (And I'm no film buff either for the record.)
[07/11/2022, 23:18:02] Alex Regueiro: I didn't enjoy "Don't Look Now" quite so much though.
[07/11/2022, 23:18:14] Alice Lafferty: Yes that's the one I was thinking of. And Don't Look Now.
[07/11/2022, 23:18:25] Alice Lafferty: Haha interesting I really liked it.
[07/11/2022, 23:18:41] Alice Lafferty: Why not?
[07/11/2022, 23:18:51] Alex Regueiro: Some films you just see at the wrong time or in the wrong mood. Maybe that was one of them. Because if I liked his other two films..
[07/11/2022, 23:19:09] Alex Regueiro: Other two... as if he only made three heh.
[07/11/2022, 23:19:54] Alex Regueiro: I honestly can't remember, sorry
[07/11/2022, 23:20:06] Alice Lafferty: Yes it's under-appreciated how much this will affect reception of a film, or music for that matter.
[07/11/2022, 23:20:54] Alice Lafferty: Haha that's ok
[07/11/2022, 23:21:17] Alex Regueiro: Do you like the Coen Brothers? I think a few of their films are excellent, but I really don't rate Miller's Crossing.
[07/11/2022, 23:21:58] Alice Lafferty: I've only ever seen the Big Lebowski and No Country For Old Men.
[07/11/2022, 23:22:07] Alice Lafferty: I though Lebowski was kind of overrated
[07/11/2022, 23:22:12] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it is
[07/11/2022, 23:22:17] Alex Regueiro: It's okay but nothing extraordinary
[07/11/2022, 23:22:26] Alex Regueiro: No Country for Old Men is a very good film though, no?
[07/11/2022, 23:22:29] Alice Lafferty: But NCFOM was great, I thought
[07/11/2022, 23:24:07] Alex Regueiro: Do you watch Netflix or TV series much?
[07/11/2022, 23:25:17] Alice Lafferty: Not really, no. I haven't seen a lot of the so-called 'golden age of TV' series.
[07/11/2022, 23:25:27] Alice Lafferty: Do you?
[07/11/2022, 23:26:06] Alex Regueiro: There's some merit to calling it that. Films took a tumble after 2005 or 2010, but there have been some excellent series
[07/11/2022, 23:26:21] Alex Regueiro: I've missed out on a lot of the really popular ones, but I do enjoy a good series these days
[07/11/2022, 23:26:35] Alex Regueiro: Often foreign ones
[07/11/2022, 23:27:01] Alice Lafferty: My parents sort of carried over that middle class aspirational 'TV is bad for you' thing from the 20th century.
[07/11/2022, 23:27:59] Alice Lafferty: The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad...
[07/11/2022, 23:28:36] Alex Regueiro: I had exactly those three in mind when you said "golden age" haha
[07/11/2022, 23:28:47] Alex Regueiro: Have friends who rave about all three, but not seen any
[07/11/2022, 23:28:52] Alice Lafferty: I think we have a Netflix account but it's not really used.
[07/11/2022, 23:28:57] Alice Lafferty: Me neither.
[07/11/2022, 23:29:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I had some of that too, mainly from my mum. These days both my parents are worse bingers than me!
[07/11/2022, 23:29:36] Alex Regueiro: Admirable. My dad really needs to find better ways of spending his nights. As do I sometimes heh
[07/11/2022, 23:30:24] Alice Lafferty: From what I've seen of Breaking Bad (maybe 2 half-episodes), it didn't seem a significant cut above any other crime drama. I think it's just people letting themselves off the intellectual hook.
[07/11/2022, 23:31:34] Alice Lafferty: I'm not really in any position to be a snob about TV though
[07/11/2022, 23:31:57] Alex Regueiro: Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones really didn't appeal to me, for different reasons
[07/11/2022, 23:32:15] Alex Regueiro: Soprans and The Wire I might hypothetically enjoy
[07/11/2022, 23:33:07] Alex Regueiro: Nah, snob away. I can very much be like that about film or series, especially film. And I don't really like pretence, but equally there are certain things I can't easily compromise on
[07/11/2022, 23:34:42] Alex Regueiro: Okay, so do you want me to book the SJSS concert then? Or still not decided?
[07/11/2022, 23:53:07] Alice Lafferty: Do you still get the membership discount?
[08/11/2022, 00:04:46] Alex Regueiro: it's ¬£10 for you (student), ¬£12 for me
[08/11/2022, 00:04:53] Alex Regueiro: No "Young Friends" scheme on that one
[08/11/2022, 00:05:03] Alex Regueiro: Still very affordable
[08/11/2022, 00:05:21] Alex Regueiro: I suggest you choose solely on which concert/venue/day you prefer üôÇ
[08/11/2022, 18:02:59] Alice Lafferty: Hi, sorry for not getting back to you earlier.
[08/11/2022, 18:42:55] Alex Regueiro: Hey, no worries
[08/11/2022, 18:43:03] Alex Regueiro: Any thoughts?
[08/11/2022, 20:57:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Let's say SJSS on Saturday then.
[08/11/2022, 21:03:54] Alice Lafferty: The Wigmore Hall concert on Friday (Brahms, Faur√© and Mozart) I can't do because Friday is my mum's birthday.
[08/11/2022, 21:04:31] Alice Lafferty: Hopefully that is still all ok with you and sorry for taking so long to decide!
[08/11/2022, 22:55:35] Alex Regueiro: That's quite alright
[08/11/2022, 22:55:38] Alex Regueiro: I'll book that then!
[08/11/2022, 22:55:59] Alex Regueiro: We were looking at the Thursday one mainly, weren't we? But yeah I'd mentioned that before too.
[08/11/2022, 22:56:16] Alex Regueiro: And it's my mum's birthday on Monday in fact
[08/11/2022, 23:04:34] Alex Regueiro: Looks like only gallery seats are available. Maybe because it's a full orchestra and they're taking up most of the ground floor, not sure. That okay?
[08/11/2022, 23:16:59] Alex Regueiro: Booked üôÇ
[08/11/2022, 23:27:07] Alice Lafferty: I don't mind? Sorry, should have booked a bit earlier.
[08/11/2022, 23:27:39] Alex Regueiro: All sorted. It says "restricted view" but I reckon the setup will be different from normal.
[08/11/2022, 23:27:57] Alex Regueiro: Anyway programme is great, looking forward to it.
[08/11/2022, 23:29:04] Alice Lafferty: Ok, and if you have a ticket you can sit anywhere in the gallery? I mean they don't seem to give seat numbers.
[08/11/2022, 23:29:28] Alice Lafferty: Ok good. I wasn't sure because it didn't seem like Rachmaninoff was particularly a favourite or anything!
[08/11/2022, 23:29:54] Alice Lafferty: I'm booking mine now
[08/11/2022, 23:29:55] Alex Regueiro: I love Rachmaninov's piano works, including this concerto
[08/11/2022, 23:30:01] Alex Regueiro: I already booked yours
[08/11/2022, 23:30:06] Alex Regueiro: sorry
[08/11/2022, 23:30:16] Alex Regueiro: Forgot you said you wanted to book your own
[08/11/2022, 23:30:24] Alex Regueiro: Just bring a tenner or Paypal me now if you prefer?
[08/11/2022, 23:30:53] Alex Regueiro: And his all-night vigil, since you introduced me to it üôÇ
[08/11/2022, 23:30:59] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see, that was nice of you. Also very close because I was just about to buy a third ticket!
[08/11/2022, 23:31:07] Alice Lafferty: Ok will do üëç
[08/11/2022, 23:31:11] Alex Regueiro: Yes, just in the nick of time!
[08/11/2022, 23:31:33] Alice Lafferty: I guess we kind of saved ¬£3
[08/11/2022, 23:31:50] Alex Regueiro: indeed
[08/11/2022, 23:32:03] Alice Lafferty: Which version did you listen to out of interest?
[08/11/2022, 23:32:33] Alex Regueiro: Found on on iTunes and previewed it, let me check...
[08/11/2022, 23:32:41] Alice Lafferty: Imo Polyanky's USSR Ministry of Culture one is the best.
[08/11/2022, 23:32:41] Alex Regueiro: Viktor Popv & Academy of Choral Art Moscow
[08/11/2022, 23:32:52] Alice Lafferty: Ok interesting
[08/11/2022, 23:33:15] Alex Regueiro: ‚ò≠üôåüèº
[08/11/2022, 23:33:43] Alice Lafferty: ;)
[08/11/2022, 23:34:36] Alex Regueiro: I do admit I have a bias towards performances from the composer's country. Especially if it's nationalistic music (this isn't so much)
[08/11/2022, 23:59:47] Alex Regueiro: Look up the Etudes Tableaux if you want some other good Rachmaninov piano pieces.
[09/11/2022, 00:00:16] Alex Regueiro: I bid you good night with this little gem, which might amuse/interest you.
[09/11/2022, 00:00:17] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kMyDUf9Frg
[09/11/2022, 13:40:42] Alice Lafferty: Hm interesting thank you. Going to watch now.
[09/11/2022, 14:06:27] Alex Regueiro: üôÇ
[09/11/2022, 17:50:55] Alex Regueiro: Oh BTW, happy to book that Chinese restaurant for Saturday again if you think you might be up for it...
[09/11/2022, 21:25:25] Alice Lafferty: This was interesting. And I basically agree, I would never describe leftism as being generally gnostic.
[09/11/2022, 21:26:01] Alice Lafferty: However I still maintain that transgenderism, specifically, has a gnostic metaphysics.
[09/11/2022, 21:26:51] Alice Lafferty: I also disagree that transhumanism is immanent, I think it is certainly transcendent.
[09/11/2022, 21:30:35] Alice Lafferty: Imo 'transhumanism' is not ideologically mature yet. It's still in a formative 'bridging' phase of of altering physical bodies, but I think that is changing.
[09/11/2022, 21:30:44] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[09/11/2022, 21:30:45] Alex Regueiro: yeah
[09/11/2022, 21:30:50] Alice Lafferty: https://laboriacuboniks.net/manifesto/xenofeminism-a-politics-for-alienation/
[09/11/2022, 21:31:19] Alex Regueiro: He does good work of dismantling that analogy in its generality. It's too simplistic. I agree transgenderism is very gnostic-dualistic though.
[09/11/2022, 21:31:28] Alice Lafferty: Imo neo-gnostics will begin to elide the spiritual realm with the digital realm. It's all basically the same thing: pure form or pure information without matter, ie 'ascend/upload to the Cloud(s)'.
[09/11/2022, 21:32:11] Alice Lafferty: Yeah that guy (Dutton? not familiar) was pretty sloppy.
[09/11/2022, 21:32:36] Alex Regueiro: It's not immanent, but I do think it's a concern. This radical self-body seems to be where out metaphysics is heading in some respects, in particular with regards to sexual identity, but also perhaps race and some other things (that's trickier)
[09/11/2022, 21:33:08] Alex Regueiro: üò®
[09/11/2022, 21:33:46] Alex Regueiro: A friend linked me to him once before without comment, and I wasn't impressed. He likes a good rant, and his theories are nothing more than superficially attractive really
[09/11/2022, 21:35:20] Alice Lafferty: Apparently he has a phd in theology??
[09/11/2022, 21:35:29] Alex Regueiro: Oh really? Interesting
[09/11/2022, 21:36:29] Alex Regueiro: This Irish guy did a separate video just on transhumanism by the way. He develops his idea a bit more. Don't at all feel obliged to listen though
[09/11/2022, 21:36:30] Alice Lafferty: To be honest I understand the appeal.
[09/11/2022, 21:36:59] Alice Lafferty: What does he think?
[09/11/2022, 21:37:55] Alex Regueiro: I forget the details, but he sees modernism and its extreme individualism as very much progress towards transhumanism, towards making our bodies irrelevant or secondary...
[09/11/2022, 21:38:12] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, the first time I heard it, I thought there might well be something to it
[09/11/2022, 21:38:45] Alice Lafferty: If anything from a perspective of moral and spiritual hygiene. It's nice to think that if you scour off the kenoma then you would reach a nice pure platonic soul.
[09/11/2022, 21:39:27] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly. I thought what he was saying about the exultation of 'pure will' was correct.
[09/11/2022, 21:41:01] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. It's a sort of mystical concept to me though, to me.
[09/11/2022, 21:41:15] Alex Regueiro: Platonism has a touch of the mystic about it too, even Plato's original form (I don't know much about the later stuff)
[09/11/2022, 21:41:19] Alice Lafferty: https://satanovakomunita.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Martine-Rothblatt-From-Transgender-to-Transhuman_-A-Manifesto-on-the-Freedom-of-Form-Martine-Rothblatt-2011.pdf
This is the explicit goal of *some influential transgender people
[09/11/2022, 21:41:19] Alex Regueiro: Have you read Schopenhauer?
[09/11/2022, 21:41:39] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Listen
[09/11/2022, 21:42:24] Alice Lafferty: A few days ago or last week YOU were insisting that history was driven by personal agency/individual genius/the will, and I was arguing that was mysticism!
[09/11/2022, 21:43:10] Alice Lafferty: I agree that it's mysticism, but it's a correct characterisation of the left.
[09/11/2022, 21:43:20] Alice Lafferty: By the way I need tone indicators...
[09/11/2022, 21:43:31] Alice Lafferty: Sorry if that came across as hostile
[09/11/2022, 21:44:52] Alex Regueiro: Haha. I don't remember you calling it mysticism per se, but it's quite possible you did! I would phrase it more as a consequence of individual exceptionalism than "will" or anything, but I do know what you mean. The problem here kind of boils down to how you conceptualise causality, which I think is an extremely problematic notion.
[09/11/2022, 21:45:02] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it is, I don't deny that
[09/11/2022, 21:45:50] Alex Regueiro: Ah, don't worry. Text isn't great for this, but I read it in a slightly humorous tone üôÇ
[09/11/2022, 21:46:07] Alice Lafferty: I mean, it definitely is. I'm kind of not a fan of platonism because it's also basically world-denying. I don't believe in the existence of 'essences'. I subscribe to bundle theory.
[09/11/2022, 21:46:17] Alice Lafferty: Good that was the intention
[09/11/2022, 21:46:47] Alice Lafferty: I'm not going to hurt my thumbs scrolling up to find it but yeah
[09/11/2022, 21:46:55] Alex Regueiro: My first acquaintance with "platonism" was through mathematics really, and it's given me a thorough and lasting distaste for it!
[09/11/2022, 21:47:27] Alex Regueiro: Please don't. I trust you in fact... just I've already forgotten a few details of that convo heh.
[09/11/2022, 21:48:03] Alice Lafferty: Wasn't he of the same school of thought?
[09/11/2022, 21:48:10] Alice Lafferty: I mean that there is only 'the will'
[09/11/2022, 21:49:05] Alice Lafferty: Ok interesting... can you give me an impression of this in a way that an untrained person would understand?
[09/11/2022, 21:51:07] Alex Regueiro: Yep that's what I was alluding to. I really know virtually nothing about him though. Far too continental!
[09/11/2022, 21:51:34] Alex Regueiro: Except he was depressive even by the standards of a philosopher, and really liked the nihilistic/world-denying eastern religions
[09/11/2022, 21:52:03] Alice Lafferty: That idea seems to fail for the same reasons as dualistic descriptions of consciousness do, they're both unable to give a good physical account of how they arise.
[09/11/2022, 21:52:27] Alex Regueiro: Sure. The basic idea is that the objects of mathematics (usually considered to be fundamentally sets, but alternatively categories, and formerly numbers) exist in a platonic universe of 'ideals' that has nothing to do with the physical universe
[09/11/2022, 21:53:42] Alex Regueiro: The famous (and kind of obvious) problem with this is called the (Benacerraf) epistemological problem
[09/11/2022, 21:54:08] Alice Lafferty: Yes. But he was also kind of right because he realised that behaviour is driven by reproductive competition.
[09/11/2022, 21:55:07] Alex Regueiro: Kind of... that's a whole different conversation though! Schopenhauer was writing before Darwin, all the same.
[09/11/2022, 21:55:41] Alex Regueiro: Schopenhauer still intrigues me. He has a nice style and modesty that appeals to me. Just don't think I would be on board with his philosophy to much
[09/11/2022, 21:55:46] Alice Lafferty: Exactly that's why it was impressive. Or maybe not that impressive. Anyone with eyes to see etc...
[09/11/2022, 21:55:52] Alex Regueiro: Since my own is so fundamentally naturalistic, empirical, and constructive.
[09/11/2022, 21:56:22] Alice Lafferty: This kind of reminds me of how depressed people are supposed to perceive reality more accurately.
[09/11/2022, 21:56:54] Alice Lafferty: Depression is maybe just absence of positive cognitive biases.
[09/11/2022, 21:59:06] Alice Lafferty: I know that mathematics does sometimes deal with numbers or shapes that couldn't actually exist in reality...
[09/11/2022, 21:59:40] Alex Regueiro: Hah, I haven't heard that, but I'll take it, as someone who has been depressed more than his fair share...
[09/11/2022, 21:59:58] Alex Regueiro: I'm still sceptical I've accordingly obtained some great insight into the "true nature" of things!
[09/11/2022, 22:00:31] Alice Lafferty: I did look it up... a platonic realm of numbers would be causally inert/we would not have epistemological access to it?
[09/11/2022, 22:00:49] Alex Regueiro: It does. If you're just talking about sets, then anything other than countable ones seem totally absurd from a physicalist perspective, since they can't even be enumerated.
[09/11/2022, 22:01:07] Alex Regueiro: And there are crazy consequences of the Axiom of Choice like the Banach-Tarski theorem
[09/11/2022, 22:02:17] Alex Regueiro: Some go further and say that even the naturals don't exist as a (completed) set but only in the potentiality of infinity, and some go evne further than that and say that vast numbers like the googolplex don't exist
[09/11/2022, 22:02:31] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's it
[09/11/2022, 22:02:33] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. And that weird thing where some infinities are larger than others.
[09/11/2022, 22:02:41] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[09/11/2022, 22:03:20] Alice Lafferty: 'Don't exist' - you mean don't exist in the physical world?
[09/11/2022, 22:03:24] Alex Regueiro: I wrote a pretty sloppy essay arguing against traditional platonism and for an empirical construction of mathematics, in my recent master's. I mean, I think the argument is sound, it's just sort of all over the place...
[09/11/2022, 22:03:48] Alex Regueiro: That's the problem... people have this intuitive notion of existence that I don't think they properly unpack.
[09/11/2022, 22:04:19] Alex Regueiro: Usually that sort of philosopher says that only physical/material things exist (which is too far for me)
[09/11/2022, 22:04:21] Alice Lafferty: Are there fewer than a googolplex atoms in the universe?
[09/11/2022, 22:04:29] Alex Regueiro: indeed, nowhere near that number
[09/11/2022, 22:04:41] Alex Regueiro: hence why these types consider it unphysical and thus doesn't exist
[09/11/2022, 22:05:27] Alex Regueiro: But to an extent I agree with Hilbert that mathematics can be a symbol-manipulation game... it's just that it needs to be related back to the phenomenal word at some point if it's to have any real meaning
[09/11/2022, 22:05:35] Alice Lafferty: Is it available to read...
[09/11/2022, 22:05:52] Alice Lafferty: Not that I would understand it very well.
[09/11/2022, 22:06:16] Alex Regueiro: Happy to send it to you, if you promise not to judge it too harshly. It's the least cohesive/well-developed of my essays I'm afraid. But it has good moments maybe?
[09/11/2022, 22:06:40] Alex Regueiro: Wrote it in a bit of a rush heh
[09/11/2022, 22:07:00] Alice Lafferty: I'm an easy audience because I won't be able to tell if it's correct or not
[09/11/2022, 22:07:02] Alex Regueiro: Two of the sections are at least very approachable I'd say!
[09/11/2022, 22:07:34] Alex Regueiro: Shall I send it by WhatsApp or email or what?
[09/11/2022, 22:07:42] Alice Lafferty: I see.
[09/11/2022, 22:08:37] Alice Lafferty: I only know Hilbert from having all of his ambitions about maths be slam-dunked by Godel.
[09/11/2022, 22:08:53] Alice Lafferty: And the hotel thought experiment.
[09/11/2022, 22:09:21] Alice Lafferty: Just on here is ok
[09/11/2022, 22:09:29] Alice Lafferty: Actually no
[09/11/2022, 22:09:41] Alice Lafferty: It will be easier to read it on my laptop probably
[09/11/2022, 22:11:19] Alex Regueiro: Yes, well put hah. I mean, it's more Russell & Whitehead that had their Principia ship torpedoed, but many say it ruined Hilbert's programme too (at least in its pure form)
[09/11/2022, 22:11:25] Alex Regueiro: yeah probably
[09/11/2022, 22:12:11] Alex Regueiro: That is a cool thought experiment, as is its extension to uncountable infinities!
[09/11/2022, 22:36:54] Alice Lafferty: Sorry
[09/11/2022, 22:37:03] Alice Lafferty: Just send it to me over here, that will be fine.
[09/11/2022, 22:44:24] Alex Regueiro: okay

[09/11/2022, 22:49:45] Alex Regueiro: There you go. And a bonus essay on a related subject, in case you find yourself extraordinarily bored. (It's somewhat better written.)
[09/11/2022, 22:49:55] Alex Regueiro: At your own leisure
[09/11/2022, 22:56:27] Alice Lafferty: Thanks!
[09/11/2022, 22:56:40] Alice Lafferty: I'll let you know what I think
[09/11/2022, 22:57:32] Alex Regueiro: Honestly, feel free to criticise any particular arguments. I'm just admitting upfront it's a bit disjointed.
[09/11/2022, 22:58:52] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure that's not the case.
[09/11/2022, 22:59:32] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, my mum had a copy of the FT when I saw her today, and something inspired me to do the cryptic crossword in it. Those things are hard!
[09/11/2022, 22:59:55] Alex Regueiro: Last time I did one was maybe 9 years ago, and with someone's guidance
[09/11/2022, 23:09:38] Alice Lafferty: Haha nice.
[09/11/2022, 23:10:11] Alice Lafferty: I'm actually doing the Times one now, I've never tried the FT. They vary a lot in difficulty.
[09/11/2022, 23:10:40] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. Do you usually manage to solve them without looking anything up?
[09/11/2022, 23:10:45] Alex Regueiro: Times one is pretty tricky I imagine
[09/11/2022, 23:10:57] Alice Lafferty: They're not actually challenging intellectually, it's really more a matter of being familiar with the many abbreviations, acronyms used by the setters.
[09/11/2022, 23:11:22] Alice Lafferty: It depends hugely on the setter.
[09/11/2022, 23:11:29] Alice Lafferty: About 75% of the time I can finish them.
[09/11/2022, 23:11:30] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I did think there were some common codewords used, and familiarity with the general style would help a lot...
[09/11/2022, 23:11:39] Alex Regueiro: I'm sufficiently impressed
[09/11/2022, 23:12:05] Alice Lafferty: Really often they'll be one I can't get. And sometimes again an entire grid will throw me.
[09/11/2022, 23:12:21] Alice Lafferty: They're quite fun and satisfying to do though once you get the hang of them.
[09/11/2022, 23:12:43] Alex Regueiro: Is that because the clue is too obscure or you don't know the word/phrase?
[09/11/2022, 23:13:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I can believe that. I was satisfied just getting a handful of the clues
[09/11/2022, 23:13:26] Alice Lafferty: Often the Times will have extremely obscure, technical or archaic words.
[09/11/2022, 23:14:11] Alice Lafferty: For example yesterday's. Do you know what a 'bethseda' is?
[09/11/2022, 23:14:55] Alice Lafferty: Sorry *bethesda
[09/11/2022, 23:14:55] Alex Regueiro: I thought it was a computer game company üòÑ
[09/11/2022, 23:15:03] Alex Regueiro: So... no
[09/11/2022, 23:15:28] Alice Lafferty: No, it's actually an archaic word for a non-conformist chapel.
[09/11/2022, 23:15:34] Alex Regueiro: Sounds vaguely Hebrew though
[09/11/2022, 23:15:35] Alice Lafferty: So, obviously I didn't get that one.
[09/11/2022, 23:15:37] Alex Regueiro: ahh
[09/11/2022, 23:15:52] Alice Lafferty: It is, it's a place in Jerusalem actually!
[09/11/2022, 23:15:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, if a theology student can't get that one, I think it's safe to say it's too obscure!
[09/11/2022, 23:16:29] Alice Lafferty: Yeah (not a very conscientious Theology student though).
[09/11/2022, 23:16:34] Alex Regueiro: We mathematicians don't go beyond the first three letters of the Hebrew alphabet, let alone words.
[09/11/2022, 23:16:52] Alice Lafferty: Something I've also had to do is learn all 267 species of British birds.
[09/11/2022, 23:16:58] Alice Lafferty: Because they're often mentioned.
[09/11/2022, 23:17:07] Alex Regueiro: Wow
[09/11/2022, 23:17:21] Alex Regueiro: You could be on University Challenge with that sort of knowledge
[09/11/2022, 23:17:27] Alex Regueiro: So you do one a day generally?
[09/11/2022, 23:17:31] Alice Lafferty: Also world capitals and rivers
[09/11/2022, 23:17:54] Alex Regueiro: I know very nearly all the world capitals. Except for a few tinpot island countries.
[09/11/2022, 23:18:19] Alice Lafferty: No, I'm only good at memorising formal sets of information. I'm not a very good generalist.
[09/11/2022, 23:18:38] Alice Lafferty: Me too! And all the US state capitals. But I kind of just enjoy memorising lists
[09/11/2022, 23:18:50] Alex Regueiro: Yep, those I know üôÇ
[09/11/2022, 23:18:54] Alice Lafferty: It's essential for pub quizzes right
[09/11/2022, 23:18:59] Alex Regueiro: It is
[09/11/2022, 23:19:08] Alex Regueiro: I'll have to get you to one!
[09/11/2022, 23:19:47] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, like I said if your team ever has a space free..
[09/11/2022, 23:20:01] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good
[09/11/2022, 23:20:43] Alex Regueiro: My dream was making a living off touring pub quizzes with huge jackpots... that was dashed a long time ago though. üò¢
[09/11/2022, 23:21:23] Alice Lafferty: Ha, in all seriousness would that be possible?
[09/11/2022, 23:21:32] Alice Lafferty: You'd have to be doing multiple quizzes a day I think.
[09/11/2022, 23:21:38] Alex Regueiro: No ha. Even if you went to one a night...
[09/11/2022, 23:21:41] Alice Lafferty: To make minimum wage
[09/11/2022, 23:22:02] Alex Regueiro: yepp
[09/11/2022, 23:22:23] Alice Lafferty: If only there was some kind of job that remunerated knowing useless trivia.
[09/11/2022, 23:22:59] Alex Regueiro: Tell me about it...
[09/11/2022, 23:23:32] Alex Regueiro: Who Wants to be a Millionaire could work, if only my popular culture weren't so dire!
[09/11/2022, 23:23:48] Alex Regueiro: And if only inflation weren't sky-high... a million pounds doesn't go as far as it did when the show first began
[09/11/2022, 23:24:07] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, I don't even know how you get on that show?
[09/11/2022, 23:24:27] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure either, but I assume there's an application form that you just send off
[09/11/2022, 23:24:33] Alice Lafferty: Yes they should really raise the reward to match inflation shouldn't they.
[09/11/2022, 23:25:09] Alex Regueiro: Who Wants to be a Millionaire... Now CPI-linked!
[09/11/2022, 23:25:12] Alex Regueiro: Great tagline
[09/11/2022, 23:25:49] Alice Lafferty: Do you want to try a clue from the crossword? :)
[09/11/2022, 23:25:59] Alex Regueiro: Yes please
[09/11/2022, 23:26:14] Alex Regueiro: And funny you say that... was just about to be cheeky and ask if you're stuck on one
[09/11/2022, 23:26:33] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Record of Turkish governor visiting in foreign lands (5,4)
[09/11/2022, 23:26:41] Alice Lafferty: I haven't got this one yet
[09/11/2022, 23:27:07] Alice Lafferty: I can tell you that you're looking for 1) the definition word and 2) the wordplay
[09/11/2022, 23:27:10] Alex Regueiro: Turkish governor is a "bey", if that helps...
[09/11/2022, 23:27:18] Alex Regueiro: Unless they're looking for a specific one (probably not?)
[09/11/2022, 23:27:22] Alice Lafferty: Ok I didn't know that!
[09/11/2022, 23:27:32] Alex Regueiro: Well, Ottoman really. But same thing.
[09/11/2022, 23:27:51] Alice Lafferty: The definition word is always the first or last word of the clue
[09/11/2022, 23:28:05] Alex Regueiro: Yep, this is what I read earlier today. Good to confirm though.
[09/11/2022, 23:28:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh it's Abbey Road
[09/11/2022, 23:28:09] Alex Regueiro: haha
[09/11/2022, 23:28:12] Alex Regueiro: well done
[09/11/2022, 23:28:48] Alex Regueiro: "road" corresponds to "in foreign lands" somehow?
[09/11/2022, 23:28:50] Alice Lafferty: See, if you've simply never come across 'bey' before, then you're practically stuffed.
[09/11/2022, 23:28:56] Alice Lafferty: 'Abroad'
[09/11/2022, 23:29:08] Alice Lafferty: 'Bey' in 'ab-bey-road'
[09/11/2022, 23:29:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that bit I got, "a bey"
[09/11/2022, 23:29:39] Alex Regueiro: So sneaky
[09/11/2022, 23:29:46] Alice Lafferty: Yeah
[09/11/2022, 23:29:51] Alice Lafferty: Often there's anagrams too
[09/11/2022, 23:29:52] Alex Regueiro: spliced into it
[09/11/2022, 23:30:01] Alex Regueiro: Yep I got one of those today and was chuffed ha
[09/11/2022, 23:30:12] Alex Regueiro: I forget the codeword they used...
[09/11/2022, 23:30:37] Alice Lafferty: They'll use words like 'scrambled' or 'exotic' or 'new' to indicate an anagram
[09/11/2022, 23:30:42] Alice Lafferty: Or anything like that
[09/11/2022, 23:30:48] Alice Lafferty: Again just a matter of familiarity
[09/11/2022, 23:30:52] Alex Regueiro: indeed
[09/11/2022, 23:30:56] Alice Lafferty: I wonder what the FT one is loke
[09/11/2022, 23:31:15] Alex Regueiro: It was pretty smell. Probably easy by your standards. I can dig it out if you like...
[09/11/2022, 23:32:11] Alice Lafferty: You'd be surprised. I've gotten used to this setter and find others take me much longer!
[09/11/2022, 23:34:45] Alex Regueiro: ah
[09/11/2022, 23:36:05] Alex Regueiro: Want me to give you one?
[09/11/2022, 23:38:09] Alice Lafferty: Go on then.
[09/11/2022, 23:38:18] Alice Lafferty: Don't count on me to get it though..
[09/11/2022, 23:38:41] Alex Regueiro: You'll probably embarrass me with how quickly you get it.
[09/11/2022, 23:38:59] Alice Lafferty: No, I'll embarrass myself for not getting it at all.
[09/11/2022, 23:39:22] Alice Lafferty: It's not embarrassing for you as you're not as practiced.
[09/11/2022, 23:39:23] Alex Regueiro: Tease endless value from a plant (7)
[09/11/2022, 23:39:31] Alice Lafferty: Ok...
[09/11/2022, 23:39:41] Alice Lafferty: Something 'wort'
[09/11/2022, 23:39:51] Alex Regueiro: See, you're quick!
[09/11/2022, 23:40:02] Alice Lafferty: Cow wort... is that a thing
[09/11/2022, 23:40:20] Alex Regueiro: Might be, but that's not it
[09/11/2022, 23:40:29] Alice Lafferty: Do you have the answer?
[09/11/2022, 23:40:33] Alex Regueiro: yeah
[09/11/2022, 23:40:53] Alice Lafferty: Need tease synonym, I guess
[09/11/2022, 23:40:57] Alice Lafferty: Obviously mind has gone blank
[09/11/2022, 23:41:09] Alex Regueiro: One I din't get: Affected by a gin cocktail promotion (8)
[09/11/2022, 23:41:21] Alex Regueiro: It's a tough one. Old-fashioned word. "rag"
[09/11/2022, 23:41:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh ragwort.
[09/11/2022, 23:41:46] Alice Lafferty: I thought it was going to be a plant I'd never heard of... but I have heard of that so I really have no excuse
[09/11/2022, 23:41:48] Alex Regueiro: yup
[09/11/2022, 23:42:07] Alex Regueiro: True, though no one says "I'm ragging you" these days!
[09/11/2022, 23:42:24] Alice Lafferty: Promotion probably indicates 'ad'
[09/11/2022, 23:42:51] Alice Lafferty: It's usually easier to split into parts.
[09/11/2022, 23:43:44] Alice Lafferty: 'Affected' - as in 'pretended'
[09/11/2022, 23:43:46] Alice Lafferty: ...
[09/11/2022, 23:44:04] Alice Lafferty: Agin is an anagram for...
[09/11/2022, 23:45:05] Alice Lafferty: I guess 'ad' isn't correct. Unless affected is not the definition word at all.
[09/11/2022, 23:45:11] Alice Lafferty: That would make promotion the definition word.
[09/11/2022, 23:45:16] Alex Regueiro: It's not üôÇ
[09/11/2022, 23:45:20] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, what do you think?
[09/11/2022, 23:45:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh you have the answer?
[09/11/2022, 23:45:31] Alice Lafferty: Wait don't tell me
[09/11/2022, 23:45:39] Alex Regueiro: I got fed up and looked this one up, so I won't say anything unless you ask
[09/11/2022, 23:45:45] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[09/11/2022, 23:45:58] Alice Lafferty: Aign
[09/11/2022, 23:46:04] Alice Lafferty: Is it 'campaign'
[09/11/2022, 23:46:08] Alex Regueiro: yep
[09/11/2022, 23:46:16] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[09/11/2022, 23:46:16] Alex Regueiro: well done
[09/11/2022, 23:46:26] Alice Lafferty: You have no idea how relieved I am that I got that
[09/11/2022, 23:46:48] Alex Regueiro: I didn't realise "a gin" was a synonym, that really didn't help...
[09/11/2022, 23:47:02] Alex Regueiro: And "camp" is a very loose synonym of "affected"
[09/11/2022, 23:47:04] Alice Lafferty: Yeah 'cocktail'
[09/11/2022, 23:47:11] Alex Regueiro: ahh
[09/11/2022, 23:47:23] Alice Lafferty: It is yeah
[09/11/2022, 23:47:35] Alex Regueiro: My mind was stuck on Martinis and Negronis!
[09/11/2022, 23:47:37] Alice Lafferty: I was getting that thing where you freeze up when someone's watching you work.
[09/11/2022, 23:47:44] Alex Regueiro: ha sorry
[09/11/2022, 23:47:44] Alice Lafferty: Same I was there for ages as well.
[09/11/2022, 23:48:02] Alice Lafferty: And I don't know much about cocktails so I thought 'I'm obviously missing one here...'
[09/11/2022, 23:48:21] Alex Regueiro: Me too. I would have had to have cancelled the date if you didn't get it.
[09/11/2022, 23:48:31] Alex Regueiro: (joke, to be clear!)
[09/11/2022, 23:48:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha written off for subpar crossword skills. On to the next
[09/11/2022, 23:49:31] Alice Lafferty: I should get them quicker because I've been doing them for a while now.
[09/11/2022, 23:50:07] Alex Regueiro: Got to filter them out somehow eh
[09/11/2022, 23:50:09] Alice Lafferty: Competitively people can complete a full size grid in 2 minutes or something.
[09/11/2022, 23:50:20] Alex Regueiro: gosh
[09/11/2022, 23:50:51] Alex Regueiro: I tend to do the general knowledge crossword when I look at the paper... might have to try one or two of these though.
[09/11/2022, 23:51:30] Alice Lafferty: Oh same. The Sunday Times does one of those. They can have pretty obscure answers too though.
[09/11/2022, 23:51:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah some can be these random authors... or plants...
[09/11/2022, 23:52:23] Alice Lafferty: Or the discus gold medalist in the 1988 olympics
[09/11/2022, 23:52:35] Alex Regueiro: Was that one?! Madness.
[09/11/2022, 23:53:56] Alice Lafferty: üôÑ
[09/11/2022, 23:54:26] Alex Regueiro: Sorry. I realised you were being hyperbolic as soon as I typed that.
[09/11/2022, 23:54:56] Alice Lafferty: Haha only a bit, but that's not far off.
[09/11/2022, 23:55:16] Alice Lafferty: They'll have cricket or football players from the 60s/70s.
[09/11/2022, 23:55:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. To be fair `ll the old sports one seem obscure to me, given my pop culture knowledge.
[09/11/2022, 23:55:48] Alex Regueiro: I know a few of the really famous ones, that's it.
[09/11/2022, 23:56:00] Alice Lafferty: Maybe not that obscure but may as well be to me.
[09/11/2022, 23:56:16] Alex Regueiro: Yep that's what I'm saying
[09/11/2022, 23:56:27] Alex Regueiro: They need a UC-style crossword. That's my niche.
[09/11/2022, 23:56:42] Alex Regueiro: So have you finished this one or am I distracting you too much?
[09/11/2022, 23:57:12] Alice Lafferty: I would love to be able to strictly define the topics I was quizzed on.
[09/11/2022, 23:57:19] Alice Lafferty: But I guess that would kind of defeat the point.
[09/11/2022, 23:57:47] Alice Lafferty: I haven't no, as I have to concentrate a bit
[09/11/2022, 23:58:31] Alex Regueiro: I think we should all get one or two vetos on topics at least.
[09/11/2022, 23:58:35] Alex Regueiro: That would be ace
[09/11/2022, 23:58:43] Alice Lafferty: I will tell you if there's any more I get stuck on
[09/11/2022, 23:58:53] Alex Regueiro: Only natural. I'll let you work on it. üôÇ
[09/11/2022, 23:59:31] Alice Lafferty: I would veto sport and soap opera actors (who always seem to come up?? Not in UC but in pub quizzes)
[10/11/2022, 00:00:11] Alice Lafferty: Huh beginning to think the ones I've gone to are just lowbrow.
[10/11/2022, 00:00:13] Alex Regueiro: Oh god yes. I would veto pop culture as a whole (and hope it includes both soaps and crappy pop music).
[10/11/2022, 00:00:26] Alex Regueiro: pub quizzes?
[10/11/2022, 00:00:39] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[10/11/2022, 00:01:01] Alex Regueiro: Most are a bit on the low-brow side unfortunately. And even the ones that aren't tend to move that way over time
[10/11/2022, 00:01:02] Alex Regueiro: Alas!
[10/11/2022, 00:01:05] Alice Lafferty: And I would ask for double geography
[10/11/2022, 00:01:36] Alex Regueiro: The one I go to regularly used to have a country outline one every week (they stopped it). My team would always just pass that to me.
[10/11/2022, 00:01:48] Alice Lafferty: Oh those are so fun
[10/11/2022, 00:01:53] Alex Regueiro: Double history & science for me!
[10/11/2022, 00:01:56] Alex Regueiro: yep
[10/11/2022, 00:02:30] Alice Lafferty: I did notice the Forest Gate Inn advertising one, but who knows what it's like.
[10/11/2022, 00:03:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I remember, that was one of the first things you said. üôÇ
[10/11/2022, 00:03:35] Alex Regueiro: Not sure my team would go there, but would be happy to try it.
[10/11/2022, 00:04:41] Alice Lafferty: Of course. I've already said this but I was really impressed with how well you know history, and in talking to you more about papal history.
[10/11/2022, 00:04:50] Alice Lafferty: Duh sorry I forgot
[10/11/2022, 00:05:09] Alice Lafferty: I mean in your UC performance
‚Äé[10/11/2022, 00:06:13] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[10/11/2022, 00:06:21] Alex Regueiro: I know you don't need more puzzles, but I couldn't resist!
[10/11/2022, 00:06:34] Alex Regueiro: These are from my last Imperial College newsletter
[10/11/2022, 00:07:13] Alex Regueiro: Thanks, though I'm not sure I could say much more about Papal History. There's a podcast devoted to the history of the papacy, but I haven't listened yet...
[10/11/2022, 00:08:02] Alex Regueiro: I just happened to know the date of the start of the Council of Trent, very randomly
[10/11/2022, 19:31:51] Alice Lafferty: Ah, these look good but I'm afraid I don't know the rules of tennis well enough, and bridge not at all!
[10/11/2022, 19:32:01] Alice Lafferty: Let me try the chess one
[10/11/2022, 19:36:03] Alice Lafferty: Is it asking for a variant of chess?
[10/11/2022, 19:39:50] Alice Lafferty: I just looked up the rules of tennis. You have to score 24 points to win a set. I'm not sure... is the answer 12 maybe?
[10/11/2022, 19:40:13] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, hopeless. Tell me the answers if you have them.
[10/11/2022, 19:40:53] Alice Lafferty: Long live the counter-reformation...
[10/11/2022, 22:17:00] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[10/11/2022, 22:17:02] Alice Lafferty: Idk, is it scholar's mate or fool's mate?
[10/11/2022, 22:17:12] Alex Regueiro: Afraid not quite so simple...
[10/11/2022, 22:17:20] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I don't know bridge either, so I couldn't do that unfortunately
[10/11/2022, 22:17:31] Alice Lafferty: Ok tell me answers then
[10/11/2022, 22:17:42] Alex Regueiro: Oh sorry, I'd just presumed you knew... Anyway, 12 is a sensible answer and was my first thought, but not right üôÇ
[10/11/2022, 22:17:44] Alex Regueiro: 4
[10/11/2022, 22:18:18] Alex Regueiro: Can you see?
[10/11/2022, 22:18:31] Alice Lafferty: It is 24 points though?
[10/11/2022, 22:18:36] Alex Regueiro: 4 points
[10/11/2022, 22:18:39] Alex Regueiro: that's all
[10/11/2022, 22:18:52] Alice Lafferty: Oh, I thought to win a set you had to win 6 games
[10/11/2022, 22:19:01] Alice Lafferty: Of 4 points each
[10/11/2022, 22:19:06] Alex Regueiro: It's kind of unfair though, that you're not very familiar with the game!
[10/11/2022, 22:19:10] Alice Lafferty: That's the only information I could get online sorry!
[10/11/2022, 22:19:15] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[10/11/2022, 22:20:09] Alice Lafferty: How can you win 6 games whilst only touching the ball 4 times?
[10/11/2022, 22:20:25] Alex Regueiro: Basically what you do is purposely miss each ball (and double fault on all your serves) until the scoreline in games gets to 6-5 to you... which can happen if your opponent serves first. Then you ace the next 4 points to win the that game and win the set 7-5
[10/11/2022, 22:20:35] Alex Regueiro: Only getting the ball over the net
[10/11/2022, 22:20:41] Alex Regueiro: you have to touch it more, yeah
[10/11/2022, 22:21:06] Alice Lafferty: ‚òπÔ∏è I never would have got that
[10/11/2022, 22:21:16] Alex Regueiro: Chess one I solved but I forgot hah... will have to think about it again briefly! (Do you play?)
[10/11/2022, 22:21:16] Alice Lafferty: Sorry!
[10/11/2022, 22:21:48] Alex Regueiro: No, that was kind of mean of me... I should say sorry!
[10/11/2022, 22:22:01] Alex Regueiro: How'd you get on with that cryptic crossword?
[10/11/2022, 22:22:08] Alice Lafferty: Only a little bit. Not very good, and not very well-versed in the various strategies etc.
[10/11/2022, 22:22:33] Alice Lafferty: I didn't really get what the question was asking honestly.
[10/11/2022, 22:22:46] Alex Regueiro: The guy who set these puzzles is a bit of a legend of a professor at Imperial. One of my best friends used to have him for some courses. He's a triple grandmaster! In chess, chess problem solving, and bridge.
[10/11/2022, 22:23:12] Alex Regueiro: He used to do simultaneous chess exhibitions against students each year. Might still do.
[10/11/2022, 22:23:20] Alice Lafferty: Ok, there was definitely one I didn't get. Although I think the paper's been throw away now
[10/11/2022, 22:23:37] Alice Lafferty: Ohh.
[10/11/2022, 22:23:45] Alex Regueiro: Fair. Only one left is a good result still?
[10/11/2022, 22:23:58] Alex Regueiro: I mean, sounds like a success to me
[10/11/2022, 22:24:05] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I'm an amateur!
[10/11/2022, 22:24:45] Alice Lafferty: I guess so
[10/11/2022, 22:25:17] Alex Regueiro: Chess is occasionally fun... takes a lot of patience and time though. I used to play properly, but these days not really.
[10/11/2022, 22:26:03] Alice Lafferty: Yes I keep meaning to get into it properly. So what was the answer to that question?
[10/11/2022, 22:26:57] Alex Regueiro: Well, let me know if you want any tips. Though you may or may not want to value them!
[10/11/2022, 22:27:07] Alex Regueiro: One sec, I'll try to recreate it
[10/11/2022, 22:27:43] Alice Lafferty: Was the question asking you to give the entire sequence of moves of the game?
[10/11/2022, 22:28:09] Alex Regueiro: Deus vult!
[10/11/2022, 22:28:10] Alice Lafferty: I've never simulated anything like that before
[10/11/2022, 22:28:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. That's the form chess puzzles take. Again, really not fair if you haven't done them before...
[10/11/2022, 22:28:48] Alice Lafferty: OhüòÇ
[10/11/2022, 22:30:13] Alice Lafferty: Ok, now that I know what it's asking let me think about it a bit in that case before telling me.
[10/11/2022, 22:31:07] Alex Regueiro: Okay sounds good
[10/11/2022, 22:31:43] Alice Lafferty: I'm unlikely to get it but just humour me..
[10/11/2022, 22:32:21] Alex Regueiro: Gladly...
[10/11/2022, 22:32:33] Alex Regueiro: There are a couple of insight as I recall. Not easy, but you have a chance.
[10/11/2022, 22:34:48] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and don't try it without a board, that's just masochism!
[10/11/2022, 22:35:09] Alex Regueiro: https://lichess.org/analysis if it helps
[10/11/2022, 22:35:26] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I really should have said
[10/11/2022, 22:35:27] Alice Lafferty: No! I have an app
[10/11/2022, 22:35:32] Alex Regueiro: excellent
[10/11/2022, 22:35:53] Alex Regueiro: As long as you're not trying to solve it in your head haha
[10/11/2022, 22:50:31] Alice Lafferty: Eh, I think I'm going about it the wrong way. I guess white's final position must be Ke5? If I was black I would respond by playing pawn to c5 but I can't see how that leads to that result.
[10/11/2022, 22:51:12] Alice Lafferty: What technique should you use to solve these? Just work backwards?
[10/11/2022, 22:51:34] Alex Regueiro: You're thinking along the right lines
[10/11/2022, 22:51:40] Alice Lafferty: *I mean respond to 1e4
[10/11/2022, 22:52:05] Alex Regueiro: Can't remember if it's Ke5 the final move for white though... let me check
[10/11/2022, 22:52:23] Alex Regueiro: And yeah, working backwards definitely helps. A combination.
[10/11/2022, 23:09:55] Alex Regueiro: Whenever you want to have a look: https://lichess.org/LGLcRYey#10
[11/11/2022, 00:13:56] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to try to get some sleep soon... Hope you have a nice day tomorrow with your mum. üòä
[11/11/2022, 18:36:45] Alice Lafferty: Thanks. Good you're sleeping at more regular hours?

[11/11/2022, 18:37:21] Alice Lafferty: Wait, I mean
‚Äé[11/11/2022, 18:37:44] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/11/2022, 18:38:05] Alice Lafferty: I'm still learning the notation...
[11/11/2022, 18:40:58] Alice Lafferty: It would be something like: white pawn to e4, black knight to nc6, then white king to e2, black knight to d4, white king to e3, black pawn to c6, white king to f4, black knight to e2, white king to e5, black queen to a5, check mate.
[11/11/2022, 18:42:59] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I've never done one of those before so it took me a while to catch on!
[11/11/2022, 20:22:40] Alex Regueiro: No worries!
[11/11/2022, 20:23:41] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, your board doesn't match your description, no? Let me check.
[11/11/2022, 20:25:28] Alex Regueiro: That's not checkmate I'm afraid.
[11/11/2022, 20:25:32] Alex Regueiro: It's really tricky actually. I feel terribly mean now!
[11/11/2022, 20:25:53] Alex Regueiro: I thought you had the right idea at first, marching your king out though. üôÇ
[11/11/2022, 20:26:03] Alex Regueiro: Have a look at my link above if you like
[11/11/2022, 20:26:26] Alex Regueiro: It's very hit and miss still, but sometimes... How about you?
[12/11/2022, 00:45:07] Alice Lafferty: I didn't get the chess puzzle, sorry. Will have to practise those.
[12/11/2022, 13:31:34] Alex Regueiro: Hey Alice
[12/11/2022, 13:33:23] Alex Regueiro: What time shall we plan to meet? 7:00? Unless you want to go somewhere beforehand‚Ä¶
[12/11/2022, 16:03:28] Alice Lafferty: 7pm should be okay?
[12/11/2022, 16:28:58] Alex Regueiro: üëç
[12/11/2022, 17:10:56] Alice Lafferty: By the way I did read your essay (the first one you linked). I thought it was good, not disjointed at all. It also helped me understand a bit better where you're coming from with regards to empiricism.
[12/11/2022, 17:11:37] Alice Lafferty: Never thought of maths as a 'highly abstract form of natural science', I'd been unconsciously carrying platonic ideas about numbers.
[12/11/2022, 17:31:29] Alex Regueiro: Thank you!
[12/11/2022, 17:31:57] Alex Regueiro: Yes, it's certainly not a very standard view, at least for mathematicians... but I'm still convinced it's the right one. Happy to elaborate more if you're interested.
[12/11/2022, 17:32:38] Alex Regueiro: I don't think most working mathematicians consider the philosophical very much or at all. The platonic and set-theoretic dogma is pretty implicit and well-entrenched since the early 1900s.
[12/11/2022, 17:32:47] Alex Regueiro: See you soon. üôÇ
[12/11/2022, 17:38:25] Alice Lafferty: Interesting was this part of the backlash to logical positivism or unrelated?
[12/11/2022, 17:42:15] Alice Lafferty: I'm leaving now so I'm not late. Have to navigate from Pimlico station which will be interesting.
[12/11/2022, 18:13:23] Alex Regueiro: Delays on the Central Line here. üòû Hope I won‚Äôt be too late. Sorry!
[12/11/2022, 18:15:14] Alex Regueiro: The almighty Google tells me it‚Äôs a bit of a walk but pretty straightforward at least. Take your time.
[12/11/2022, 18:16:59] Alex Regueiro: In that it has roots in Quine, yes you could say so.
[12/11/2022, 18:52:42] Alice Lafferty: My ETA is 7:05.
[12/11/2022, 18:54:32] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll be there 10 past I think. Feel free to wait inside or at the pub on the corner.
[12/11/2022, 18:57:16] Alice Lafferty: Ok I think I'll be inside. The central line wasn't too bad then?
[12/11/2022, 19:04:38] Alex Regueiro: It was pretty bad. District too. Would have probably been early if not.
[12/11/2022, 19:05:12] Alice Lafferty: I can't go in as you have the tickets!
[12/11/2022, 19:06:43] Alice Lafferty: Which reminds me, I will send you the money now.
[12/11/2022, 19:09:51] Alice Lafferty: I waiting on the steps
[12/11/2022, 19:11:14] Alex Regueiro: One min away
[12/11/2022, 19:12:34] Alice Lafferty: I wonder if I'm at the front or back of the building.
[12/11/2022, 19:12:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I don‚Äôt see you. Must be at opposite end
[12/11/2022, 19:12:55] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll come round
[12/11/2022, 19:13:07] Alice Lafferty: Sorry. I can, it's ok?
[12/11/2022, 19:13:18] Alice Lafferty: There does seem to be someone here admitting people
[12/11/2022, 22:32:41] Alex Regueiro: Hope your journey back isn‚Äôt too difficult! Let me know when you‚Äôre home. üòä
[12/11/2022, 22:38:20] Alice Lafferty: Should be ok. Actually 15 minutes early for train but better that than late.
[12/11/2022, 22:38:45] Alice Lafferty: How do you have internet connection?
[12/11/2022, 22:55:50] Alex Regueiro: Sent that while waiting on the platform. And now I‚Äôm above ground (praise be!)
[12/11/2022, 23:17:03] Alice Lafferty: Sent you money for the ticket.
[12/11/2022, 23:22:48] Alex Regueiro: Got it, thank you
[12/11/2022, 23:24:32] Alex Regueiro: Just about worth the tenner and the trauma of taking the Tube, I trust!

[13/11/2022, 16:43:14] Alex Regueiro: How is your circadian system treating you lately?
[13/11/2022, 17:27:24] Alice Lafferty: Thanks. I know you also recommended Rachmaninoff's Etudes Tableaux. Have saved both to listen to.
[13/11/2022, 17:28:22] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I was quite tired after yesterday so was able to get to sleep a bit more easily. How about you?
[13/11/2022, 17:29:30] Alice Lafferty: By the way the leaf ornamentation we saw on the columns was 'acanthus'.
[13/11/2022, 18:02:05] Alex Regueiro: Glad to hear
[13/11/2022, 18:02:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I was pretty knackered too, so it wasn't too bad
[13/11/2022, 18:02:47] Alex Regueiro: A bit hungry when I got home, but the overpriced carrot cake did help!
[13/11/2022, 18:02:57] Alex Regueiro: Will have to try that Chinese restaurant another time...
[13/11/2022, 18:03:20] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. Thanks. Isn't that a flower too?
[13/11/2022, 18:04:44] Alex Regueiro: By the way, send me a pic of your dog if you're happy to share. üôÇ Either pre or post op is fine
[14/11/2022, 08:12:40] Alice Lafferty: I think so?

[14/11/2022, 08:14:31] Alice Lafferty: He has a kind of stump.
[14/11/2022, 08:16:23] Alice Lafferty: I won't send you anymore if you don't want. I know that, though I love my own dog, I personally find looking at pictures of other peoples' very boring.
[14/11/2022, 08:21:56] Alice Lafferty: Remembering correctly that you don't have any pets?
[14/11/2022, 13:26:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, poor thing. Does he still manage to get by walking though? Or locomoting in some fashion at least!
[14/11/2022, 13:26:25] Alex Regueiro: He looks sweet in any case
[14/11/2022, 13:27:42] Alex Regueiro: Parents an old cat. Originally my sister‚Äôs but she ran off to Argentina so‚Ä¶
[14/11/2022, 13:28:59] Alex Regueiro: She‚Äôs blind and has other minor issues but she‚Äôs lovely

[14/11/2022, 17:11:46] Alice Lafferty: Haha what exhibit was this?
[14/11/2022, 17:12:48] Alice Lafferty: Surprisingly he was able to walk very well just a couple of days after the operation.
[14/11/2022, 17:39:05] Alex Regueiro: Wildlife Photographer of the Year (Natural History Museum)
[14/11/2022, 17:39:05] Alex Regueiro: Oh good
[14/11/2022, 17:40:19] Alex Regueiro: Pretty old you said right?
[14/11/2022, 17:41:14] Alex Regueiro: Makes it a bit easier to accept I‚Äôd think/hope üôÇ
[14/11/2022, 17:51:00] Alice Lafferty: Oh I remember you saying you had to go into London again! Was it good?
[14/11/2022, 17:51:19] Alice Lafferty: He's 'only' 10. But I realise that's fairly old for a dog.
[14/11/2022, 17:51:51] Alice Lafferty: How old? Otis is also blind, deaf and now lame...
[14/11/2022, 17:52:02] Alice Lafferty: Cats live a bit longer I think?
[14/11/2022, 18:12:12] Alex Regueiro: Ah sorry, I was going to ask his name‚Ä¶ Did you name him or your parents?
[14/11/2022, 18:12:23] Alex Regueiro: Otis Redding fan by chance?
[14/11/2022, 18:13:33] Alex Regueiro: Anyway poor Otis. At least he‚Äôs clearly loved!
[14/11/2022, 18:13:59] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Depends on size I think?
[14/11/2022, 18:14:47] Alex Regueiro: Yep in general. Ours is a bit of a runt though so 14 is good going.
[14/11/2022, 18:17:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, there were some great pictures. A bit right-on and agenda driven overall but still enjoyed it. Having mum‚Äôs  birthday dinner out now.
[14/11/2022, 20:18:54] Alice Lafferty: Yes my mum
[14/11/2022, 20:19:38] Alice Lafferty: Ok nice, hope you have a good time. I'm going to look up the competition pictures.
[14/11/2022, 20:20:40] Alice Lafferty: I imagine lots on climate change?
[14/11/2022, 20:25:06] Alice Lafferty: This reminds me of what one physics lecturer said to me once: philosophy is what you do to a subject until you're in a position to do science on it.
[14/11/2022, 21:53:01] Alex Regueiro: He's great to be honest. One of my favourite soul singers.
[14/11/2022, 21:54:34] Alex Regueiro: Thanks, was really nice. French cuisine, which is I don't usually go for, but I was lucky with the choice!
[14/11/2022, 21:56:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. There was even a Greta book in the gift shop. ü§¢ But also some of the photos were just trying to make political points and were shoehorned in.
[14/11/2022, 21:56:50] Alex Regueiro: Wasn't quite as good as last year, but still some really striking pictures. Did you have a look?
[14/11/2022, 21:57:24] Alex Regueiro: And to be clear, I'm very far from a climate change "denier", it's just the sanctimonious and alarmist stuff that bothers me, for various reasons.
[14/11/2022, 21:58:31] Alex Regueiro: Hah, yes, well put. I imagine it's a pretty common view among contemporary scientists.
[14/11/2022, 21:59:01] Alex Regueiro: As I think I mentioned, I don't really believe in pure philosophy being a worthy pursuit any more, only "philosophy of X", more or less
[14/11/2022, 22:01:05] Alex Regueiro: This is very similar to "quietism" I gather.
[14/11/2022, 22:02:01] Alex Regueiro: Also, I wanted to say, I was pretty honoured you read that paper. And glad you you saw exactly where I was coming from. I'd love to develop it further at some point, though I need to mull things over more... so feel free to share any more thoughts.üôÇ
[14/11/2022, 22:11:45] Alice Lafferty: I wonder now if I was looking at the 2021 competition instead. There seemed to be an awful lot of terrifying spiders. And a cool electrified star fish kind of thing.
[14/11/2022, 22:14:21] Alice Lafferty: I've felt this way for a really long time but I suppose I'm coming round to the idea that the alarmism is justified to some degree. But yes 80% of it is like '¬£100 sustainable t shirt' status wanking.
[14/11/2022, 22:15:23] Alex Regueiro: I was just thinking that, but sounds like this year, since I remember the cool electrified starfish one! Spiders & snakes I passed over quickly, especially the snakes.
[14/11/2022, 22:15:40] Alice Lafferty: I think so, I think you mentioned this previously too. It's kind of similar to late Wittgenstein therapeutic philosophy.
[14/11/2022, 22:16:34] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I take a real interest in the kind of problems you're describing. By the way I didn't get to read the second essay you sent and I might not be able to find it in the backlog, do you mind sending it again?
[14/11/2022, 22:17:38] Alice Lafferty: Yes I'm embarrassingly squeamish. Need to do that exposure therapy where they put a tarantula on your forehead or whatever.
[14/11/2022, 22:21:09] Alex Regueiro: To some extent, certainly. But I don't think I can ever fathom how Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion are helping anyone or indeed the cause... Just entitled haute-bourgeois prats signalling their virtue (and utter naivety) at the same time. I'm also very sceptical of what a lot of the politicians and billionaires say. Easy for them to recommend strict measures for developing countries or the working class of their own nations, sitting comfy in their ivory towers... Read a decent anti-alarmist pamphlet on this today. At the same time, I'm totally on board with doing as much as we feasibly can (especially on a coordinated international level) without drastically ruining our civilisation overnight, or adopting paternalistic (neo-colonial?) attitudes towards the developing world. It's just that Britain is one of the very best in terms of green energy right now, so we shouldn't beat ourselves up too much...
[14/11/2022, 22:21:38] Alex Regueiro: Haha that would probably do the trick, albeit in the most painful way possible
[14/11/2022, 22:22:41] Alex Regueiro: Sure. It's actually a little more technical in some ways, and I don't quite agree with the thesis I was critiquing and building on any more, but it's interesting all the same, I'd like to think. üôÇ
[14/11/2022, 22:22:49] Alex Regueiro: Yup
[14/11/2022, 22:22:53] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting care to link the pamphlet?
[14/11/2022, 22:24:23] Alice Lafferty: Re the question of 'elite conspiracy'... I mean yes, it's pretty interesting when you look at precisely who benefits from eg carbon taxes.
[14/11/2022, 22:24:43] Alice Lafferty: As far as I can tell green initiatives are coming part and parcel of a global economic restructuring.
[14/11/2022, 22:24:50] Alex Regueiro: I don't think it's a conspiracy so much as a complete apathy for those less well off than them, and a cheap way of boosting their prestige even further
[14/11/2022, 22:24:52] Alice Lafferty: But it might not be a bad thing particularly.
[14/11/2022, 22:25:16] Alex Regueiro: Certainly. Without subscribing to the WEF conspiracy stuff, I'm extremely wary of what they're up to!
[14/11/2022, 22:25:28] Alice Lafferty: Nuclear energyüôè
[14/11/2022, 22:26:01] Alex Regueiro: Yes! Any so-called "environmentalists" campaigning against modern nuclear power plants are frankly self-defeating morons.
[14/11/2022, 22:26:51] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[14/11/2022, 22:26:54] Alex Regueiro: https://clairefox.substack.com/p/why-environmental-protestors-are
[14/11/2022, 22:27:22] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[14/11/2022, 22:28:28] Alice Lafferty: However, I guess it gets you thinking more generally about resources, especially non-renewing resources that are finite in the strictest sense (as in, they do not recover).
[14/11/2022, 22:28:44] Alice Lafferty: Nuclear will also fall prey to that eventually.
[14/11/2022, 22:28:44] Alex Regueiro: I'm actually more sympathetic to the environmental 'movement' (and perhaps even to Malthus) in some ways than the writer, but I still think its decent. I also like Michael Shellenberger's stuff on this topic, though I last heard it some time ago.
[14/11/2022, 22:29:02] Alex Regueiro: Right, and that's a good thing no doubt
[14/11/2022, 22:29:06] Alice Lafferty: Idk why Malthus gets such a bad rap to be honest.
[14/11/2022, 22:29:18] Alice Lafferty: Thank you, will read.
[14/11/2022, 22:29:50] Alice Lafferty: For a member of the public, it's so difficult to sift through all of the information on this.
[14/11/2022, 22:30:06] Alex Regueiro: It will, though not for some time, and it's a great option for the next couple of centuries. Hopefully in the meanwhile we can ramp up other renewables, invent fusion reactors, and generally become less greedy for energy... that's the dream!
[14/11/2022, 22:30:44] Alice Lafferty: I don't see how we will ever become less greedy for energy without deindustrialising. Which is not desirable imo.
[14/11/2022, 22:31:05] Alex Regueiro: Incredibly so. Only natural that most people don't have the time, willpower, or the education to appreciate the  hugely complex science and socioeconomics underlying the subject.
[14/11/2022, 22:31:43] Alex Regueiro: Probably not, I just mean I'm not a fan of how frivolous we are with energy and resources generally in the modern world.
[14/11/2022, 22:32:16] Alice Lafferty: I'm just working on the basis that it's highly highly improbable at this point that the entire thing is totally invented or a 'hoax'. I'm trying now to figure out whether it's going to be 'very bad' or 'apocalyptic'.
[14/11/2022, 22:34:00] Alex Regueiro: I think because he failed to predict the full ramifications of the Industrial Revolution, which is a little harsh on him. It led to such a huge increase in agricultural efficiency, disease prevention, etc. etc. He probably should have been more honest with how highly abstracted his ideas were, and the assumptions... but I'm one of those who thinks his fundamental point was pretty fair, if a little too alarmist.
[14/11/2022, 22:35:16] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I love reading about the more fantastic solutions & ideas, fission and then esp up to space colonosiation... it really fills me with admiration for human ingenuity.
[14/11/2022, 22:36:22] Alice Lafferty: But isn't it kind of right that increases in resource- efficiency can still be maxed out.
[14/11/2022, 22:36:24] Alex Regueiro: Right. It's the doomsdayers and "emergencyists" that I have a problem with. Or at least sceptical of the grasp of pragmatics and possible ulterior motives. The ones I respect are those who say we need to react promptly but in a measured and level-headed way that won't bring everything crashing down around us at the same time.
[14/11/2022, 22:36:51] Alex Regueiro: I also laugh at the people suggesting Westerners with their very low birth rates and aging populations should just "stop breeding", when you have third-world countries with ballooning populations out there which they will soon be struggling massively to support.
[14/11/2022, 22:37:47] Alex Regueiro: No doubt. It's just Malthus didn't give enough importance to technological developments and human ingenuity. But eventually we'll hit that ceiling and Malthusian catastrophe will ensue
[14/11/2022, 22:38:20] Alice Lafferty: üò¨ I'm pretty sure David Attenborough has in the past strongly suggested distributing contraceptives in SS Africa, I think the BBC presenters kind of bundled him up and went 'ok grandpa, let's get you to bed...'
[14/11/2022, 22:38:52] Alice Lafferty: This is like that Isaac Azimov story.
[14/11/2022, 22:39:22] Alex Regueiro: Same. Hard to know how far off we are, but I see it only as a good thing that humanity is striving towards these ends and capable of achieving incredible breakthroughs. I'm very much pro space colonisation, when it becomes feasible. For similar reasons to Asimov basically, who wrote about this.
[14/11/2022, 22:39:25] Alice Lafferty: To be fair, a lot of this does have a strong eugenics flavour which I don't really go in for as much
[14/11/2022, 22:39:52] Alex Regueiro: That's funny, I hadn't even seen your message when I just mentioned Asimov
[14/11/2022, 22:39:55] Alex Regueiro: (Have you read him?)
[14/11/2022, 22:40:02] Alice Lafferty: Psychic
[14/11/2022, 22:40:27] Alice Lafferty: I was thinking specifically of his 'fable' about entropy.
[14/11/2022, 22:40:29] Alice Lafferty: Forgot the title?
[14/11/2022, 22:40:30] Alex Regueiro: That's the concern, especially when it takes on a nefarious class-based or neo-colonial flavour.
[14/11/2022, 22:40:55] Alice Lafferty: The last question
[14/11/2022, 22:41:17] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, not sure I know which one you mean. Now I'm thinking of the essay I wrote about entropy, thermodynamics, and information theory though, heh.
[14/11/2022, 22:41:20] Alex Regueiro: Ah right
[14/11/2022, 22:41:22] Alice Lafferty: And some of his other short stories. I really like that one!
[14/11/2022, 22:41:32] Alex Regueiro: I need to read that.
[14/11/2022, 22:41:49] Alice Lafferty: Please let me read it, a lot of stuff I'm concerned about seems to be circling this topic. Esp the concept of negentropy.
[14/11/2022, 22:42:02] Alice Lafferty: It's really good.
[14/11/2022, 22:42:02] Alex Regueiro: I really love the 2001 series and the Rama series though. (2001 the film too, naturally!)
[14/11/2022, 22:42:31] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I've read those.
[14/11/2022, 22:43:31] Alex Regueiro: Must reads, in my book (ü•Å). The 2001 film too, if you haven't seen it.
[14/11/2022, 22:43:55] Alice Lafferty: (Sorry this is sort related to what we were just talking about) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale
[14/11/2022, 22:43:59] Alex Regueiro: This reminds me, I really need to read Olaf Stapledon too.
[14/11/2022, 22:44:23] Alice Lafferty: It's very short, like 10 pages
[14/11/2022, 22:44:40] Alex Regueiro: Ah cool
[14/11/2022, 22:45:27] Alice Lafferty: What did he write about?
[14/11/2022, 22:45:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I find that a pretty neat conceptualisation. Who knows if level 3 is even possible, but it's interesting to look at it this way
[14/11/2022, 22:46:12] Alex Regueiro: Look up Starmaker and Last and First Men
[14/11/2022, 22:46:27] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[14/11/2022, 22:46:27] Alex Regueiro: He came up with the idea of the Dyson sphere, which maybe you've heard of...
[14/11/2022, 22:47:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes! This what I was talking about
[14/11/2022, 22:47:05] Alex Regueiro: Basically macro-historical imagined histories of humanity and scientific-technological progress. But also an anthropological study.
[14/11/2022, 22:47:12] Alice Lafferty: I didn't know that originated from him.
[14/11/2022, 22:47:54] Alice Lafferty: Ok this sounds like something I would like.
[14/11/2022, 22:48:45] Alice Lafferty: Don't want to swamp you with recommendations but this is also really good on space colonisation: https://jetpress.org/v23/kirby.htm
[14/11/2022, 22:48:58] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry if you don't get round to reading it!
[14/11/2022, 22:50:28] Alice Lafferty: A definition of entropy I was given: how much we don't know about a system given how much we do know.
[14/11/2022, 22:50:34] Alice Lafferty: True or false?
[14/11/2022, 22:52:08] Alex Regueiro: Negentropy is a nice concept yes. Mathematically literally just a sign switch, but conceptually I think it's pretty useful. Schrodinger wrote a book about it and the origin of life, or someething like that?
[14/11/2022, 22:52:48] Alex Regueiro: If you're guilty of that, then I'm twice as guilty... but it's all appreciated.
[14/11/2022, 22:53:12] Alice Lafferty: Maybe? I mean, the existence of little pockets complex life (negentropy) needs explaining.
[14/11/2022, 22:54:21] Alex Regueiro: That's pretty good. I certainly prefer it over the typical and very description as "a measure of disorder" or such
[14/11/2022, 22:55:28] Alice Lafferty: Could be conceived as a kind of 'side-effect' of entropy, if you think about it.
[14/11/2022, 22:57:33] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I also have to ask you about the technical points. I mean, the earth itself is a conduit of a tremendous entropy increase (solar energy dissipating as heat). It's exactly this entropy increase in the entire system that allows the entropy in one part of the system to decrease and briefly form life.  So maybe not as mysterious as I thought.
[14/11/2022, 22:58:22] Alice Lafferty: All of my scientific information is third hand and poorly understood.
[14/11/2022, 23:00:43] Alex Regueiro: The thing about entropy is that it still permits plenty of fluctuations (of arbitrary size in fact), so although violations to the second law are quite fun thought experiments, it's not considered any profound paradox any more. Still in need of philosophical clarification though, it seems
[14/11/2022, 23:01:13] Alice Lafferty: I see
[14/11/2022, 23:01:14] Alex Regueiro: All the same, you've ended up with as good a definition as any, without actually studying physics!
[14/11/2022, 23:01:25] Alex Regueiro: Most people have a terrible idea what it really is. Even some physicists.
[14/11/2022, 23:01:43] Alice Lafferty: It seems to hold different meaning in computer science vs physics vs maths
[14/11/2022, 23:01:54] Alice Lafferty: Which doesn't help.
[14/11/2022, 23:02:19] Alice Lafferty: I mean, is that definition different from Shannon's entropy?
[14/11/2022, 23:03:27] Alice Lafferty: By the way we don't have to talk about this if you don't want. You should get paid to patiently answer questions like these.
[14/11/2022, 23:04:04] Alex Regueiro: So, I should state up front that I see entropy as fundamentally subjective and information-theoretic in origin, and thus dislike talking about it in objective terms. All the same, you are quite right that the decrease in entropy that corresponds to the flourishing of life and civilisation on Earth is more than offset by increases in entropy elsewhere.
[14/11/2022, 23:05:00] Alex Regueiro: The mathematical (computer scientific) notion was explicitly modelled on Gibbs entropy from physics, by Shannon
[14/11/2022, 23:05:07] Alex Regueiro: but yeah the semantics are quite different
[14/11/2022, 23:05:29] Alex Regueiro: However, they can be unified in quite a well-defined way, and I think my paper explains some of that.
[14/11/2022, 23:05:56] Alice Lafferty: Ok, this is in accordance with your naturalistic philosophy.
[14/11/2022, 23:06:06] Alex Regueiro: Mathematically though, Shannon entropy looks exactly like Gibbs energy in physics. Once you establish the correct conceptual mapping, it makes total sense
[14/11/2022, 23:06:16] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[14/11/2022, 23:06:35] Alice Lafferty: Did you send the paper? :s may need to scroll back up.
[14/11/2022, 23:06:43] Alex Regueiro: Sure, though there are "naturalists" (like Norton, whom I argue against) who insist that entropy must be an objective quantity.
[14/11/2022, 23:06:58] Alex Regueiro: I rely quite heavily on the work of Jaynes, an American physicist from the mid 20th C

[14/11/2022, 23:09:10] Alex Regueiro: Even if you push back against my views, it's still good
[14/11/2022, 23:09:47] Alice Lafferty: You probably get more out of talking to them because you don't need to stop and explain at every stage.

[14/11/2022, 23:11:47] Alex Regueiro: Different. The other one was about epistemology, and connects at some deep level with the empiricism-in-maths one. Feel free to read or not read whichever though, I wouldn't be offended in the slightest.
[14/11/2022, 23:11:51] Alice Lafferty: They say this about children, but so far no child seems to have come up with anything of particular use to anyoneüßê
[14/11/2022, 23:12:26] Alex Regueiro: You need to reach some threshold of general intellectual ability and education before you the "outsider view" and that novelty becomes relevant, I'd say.
[14/11/2022, 23:12:48] Alice Lafferty: I would like to, but when you sent it the first time I did not save it.
[14/11/2022, 23:13:06] Alex Regueiro: And even then it's not always an advantage. But I'm trying to be optimistic. Plus, you're evidently already pretty well read in this area for a non-scientist/philosopher.
[14/11/2022, 23:13:19] Alice Lafferty: I can scroll back up to find it maybe.
[14/11/2022, 23:14:00] Alex Regueiro: The alternative is to have a terribly long and unmanageable list for interesting things to read or research, which is my usual approach, but I'm not sure it's any better heh
[14/11/2022, 23:14:30] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Even so, don't feel obliged. I could just look most of this stuff up myself.
[14/11/2022, 23:14:39] Alex Regueiro: Does that get you to it?
[14/11/2022, 23:15:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes!
[14/11/2022, 23:15:31] Alice Lafferty: Sorry you scrolled all the way back up
[14/11/2022, 23:15:46] Alice Lafferty: I could have just done that.
[14/11/2022, 23:15:49] Alice Lafferty: Saved now.
[14/11/2022, 23:16:08] Alex Regueiro: I did a search. All very easy on laptop üôÇ
[14/11/2022, 23:16:27] Alex Regueiro: At least when I remember some phrase I used
[14/11/2022, 23:19:27] Alex Regueiro: And regardless, there's the adage that teaching is the best method of truly learning, which I think has a lot of truth in it.
[14/11/2022, 23:38:35] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to go watch a film then hit the hay. I'm guessing you already went to bed... sleep well.
[15/11/2022, 00:01:21] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok. Thanks anyway.
[15/11/2022, 00:01:59] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm still on kind of odd hours. Going to read your essay.
[15/11/2022, 00:02:44] Alice Lafferty: What are you watching?
[15/11/2022, 00:06:35] Alex Regueiro: Braveheart. Something inspired me to start rewatching it last night...
[15/11/2022, 00:07:06] Alice Lafferty: Haha I've never seen it. Of Mel Gibson's terrible Scottish accent fame?
[15/11/2022, 00:07:21] Alex Regueiro: After that maybe one of the ones you recommended a few days back üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 00:07:50] Alex Regueiro: That's the one hah. Although to be fair I don't think it's that bad... maybe because I'm even worse at accents.
[15/11/2022, 00:09:45] Alice Lafferty: Tell me how you find it.
[15/11/2022, 00:13:55] Alex Regueiro: Oh I love it, for all its flaws. Just been many years since I last saw it. But highly recommended.
[15/11/2022, 18:43:41] Alex Regueiro: 'Evening
[15/11/2022, 18:43:45] Alex Regueiro: I read the Asimov story
[15/11/2022, 18:44:21] Alex Regueiro: Great little piece
[15/11/2022, 18:44:23] Alice Lafferty: Hello, what did you think of it?
[15/11/2022, 18:44:32] Alice Lafferty: Oh good haha
[15/11/2022, 18:44:32] Alex Regueiro: So many themes at play!
[15/11/2022, 18:44:39] Alex Regueiro: I liked the style of humour too
[15/11/2022, 18:45:11] Alex Regueiro: To juggle all that and trillions of years of history in a short story... that's no easy feat, to put it mildly
[15/11/2022, 18:45:46] Alice Lafferty: Yes. It's always kind of at the back of my mind whenever talking about energy or resources now. No longer seen eg solar power as a truly 'renewable' energy.
[15/11/2022, 18:45:58] Alice Lafferty: Over the very very very long term.
[15/11/2022, 18:46:00] Alex Regueiro: Not quite sure what to comment on first. I'll probably be digesting it for some time to come still
[15/11/2022, 18:46:09] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[15/11/2022, 18:46:22] Alex Regueiro: When was it written, the 60s or something?
[15/11/2022, 18:46:41] Alice Lafferty: It's obviously speculative but I'm guessing there weren't any huge scientific inaccuracies?
[15/11/2022, 18:46:46] Alex Regueiro: Amazingly farsighted and a bit prescient, I daresay, though its age shows in a few small ways heh
[15/11/2022, 18:47:00] Alice Lafferty: I actually don't know. 50's maybe?
[15/11/2022, 18:47:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, nothing really stood out. Asimov has a really solid grasp of science. He trained as a chemist I believe.
[15/11/2022, 18:47:18] Alice Lafferty: Yes it does, inevitably
[15/11/2022, 18:47:18] Alex Regueiro: Yeah quite possibly
[15/11/2022, 18:47:51] Alex Regueiro: Things like talk of "valves", and the lack of computer voices even in the first two segments.
[15/11/2022, 18:48:21] Alice Lafferty: You mean those are realistic or unrealistic?
[15/11/2022, 18:49:16] Alex Regueiro: The idea that entropy can ever be reversed is kind of far-fetched to scientists right now, but it's also really difficult to extrapolate this concept to the point where the known laws of physics presumably breakdown (like black holes, the 'death' of the universe, etc.)
[15/11/2022, 18:49:17] Alice Lafferty: What did you think of the kind of merged single brain end state of humanity thing?
[15/11/2022, 18:49:42] Alex Regueiro: I mean, they were reflective of the time he wrote it, nothing more really. üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 18:50:32] Alice Lafferty: I read a proof that entropy can never be reversed. I will try and find it.
[15/11/2022, 18:50:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, the hive mind or that sort of thing is an idea that's been explored fairly often in sci-fi, but I imagine Asimov was one of the first. And to bring it onto a galactic and then universal scale... not something I've considered before.
[15/11/2022, 18:51:24] Alex Regueiro: It's basically the second law of thermodynamics. There's a whole history of proves, going right up to contemporary literature, which is very mathematically sophisticated. Which did you read?
[15/11/2022, 18:51:31] Alice Lafferty: The entropy (ùëÜ)of a system is related to the number of possible microstates (Œ©) that a system can adopt, in the following way:
ùëÜ=ùëòùêµlogŒ©
 Œ© must always be an integer, and it must always be at least 1; hence, entropy (ùëÜ)is always greater than or equal to zero.
[15/11/2022, 18:51:38] Alice Lafferty: I got this off a website.
[15/11/2022, 18:51:42] Alice Lafferty: So
[15/11/2022, 18:52:00] Alex Regueiro: Hah
[15/11/2022, 18:52:03] Alice Lafferty: It's not a full proof I don't think. Just to the level that a layman can understand!
[15/11/2022, 18:52:05] Alex Regueiro: So short and appealing indeed!
[15/11/2022, 18:52:59] Alice Lafferty: I know 'proof' has a different meaning in maths.
[15/11/2022, 18:53:23] Alex Regueiro: Well, it's true in some sense (though often Œ© is reconceptualised as phase space volume and thus no longer an integer). But this only shows that entropy is non-negative.
[15/11/2022, 18:53:26] Alex Regueiro: Unless there's another bit to it?
[15/11/2022, 18:53:45] Alice Lafferty: Yes true
[15/11/2022, 18:53:50] Alice Lafferty: Hm maybe
[15/11/2022, 18:54:15] Alex Regueiro: Yes, it's a very formal notion. Sometimes mathematicians don't give sufficient attention to the philosophy that underlies their logical systems and foundational axioms... but that's another matter!
[15/11/2022, 18:54:32] Alex Regueiro: I'm being called for dinner now, sorry. Chat in a bit.
[15/11/2022, 18:54:44] Alex Regueiro: (Feel free to mind-dump in the meanwhile if you like)
[15/11/2022, 18:55:03] Alice Lafferty: Ok :)
[15/11/2022, 19:16:26] Alex Regueiro: Back
[15/11/2022, 19:18:19] Alex Regueiro: The proof of the second law of thermodynamics is a really interesting subject. The first person to claim one was Ludwig Boltzmann, one of the pioneers of thermodynamics. But it turned out it was quite insufficient.
[15/11/2022, 19:18:45] Alex Regueiro: Have you read Asimov's Foundation series, by the way? Sorry, forgot if I asked before
[15/11/2022, 19:37:28] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to head off to play tennis in a few minutes...
[15/11/2022, 19:38:42] Alex Regueiro: But I was thinking, how would you be up for doing something this weekend, if you're free? Maybe low-key and local, if you fancy? üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 19:40:17] Alex Regueiro: Not that I'm opposed to meeting up in London again, just thought you might prefer that. I'd love to see you again soon anyway, and talk more in person.
[15/11/2022, 19:41:49] Alex Regueiro: Local meaning anything from Winchmore Hill to somewhere vaguely between us!
[15/11/2022, 19:43:25] Alex Regueiro: See you üéæ
[15/11/2022, 20:32:49] Alice Lafferty: Right. What do you think of his engagement with Loschmidt? Again, my reading of this is only really be superficial: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loschmidt%27s_paradox
[15/11/2022, 20:33:19] Alice Lafferty: I haven't no, worth reading?
[15/11/2022, 20:34:47] Alice Lafferty: Ok, we will find something to do in the cultural desert that is NE London.
[15/11/2022, 20:35:12] Alice Lafferty: I think I'm free this weekend.
[15/11/2022, 20:35:44] Alice Lafferty: Probably a bit late to say this now but have fun
[15/11/2022, 20:43:15] Alice Lafferty: I am free Saturday but not Sunday.
[15/11/2022, 21:56:55] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's interesting. Studied it on my course. I don't think it's too problematic once you treat it in terms of fluctuations from equilibrium. There is indeed a non-zero probability of an entropy-decreasing time reversal of some entropy-increasing process, but it's truly minute. For all intents and purposes zero.
[15/11/2022, 21:57:01] Alex Regueiro: Thank you
[15/11/2022, 21:57:42] Alex Regueiro: Very much so. Possibly my favourite sci-fi series. I think you'd find psychohistory fascinating.
[15/11/2022, 22:00:27] Alex Regueiro: Haha we don't have to. I mean, they're performing Winterreise again at Wigmore this Friday, for example. Totally up to you. But I'm more than happy to do something out here in the sticks on Saturday.
[15/11/2022, 22:02:07] Alex Regueiro: Maybe just dinner? I don't know your area, but nearer here there's obviously Epping Forest, which is lovely for walks (slightly nippy weather aside).
[15/11/2022, 22:02:57] Alex Regueiro: "Essex culture" is kind of an oxymoron, isn't it?
[15/11/2022, 22:03:40] Alex Regueiro: There are some nice country houses, that's about it probably. And they're a bit of a drive.
[15/11/2022, 22:13:53] Alice Lafferty: How was tennis?
[15/11/2022, 22:14:22] Alice Lafferty: I guess indoor this late in the year?
[15/11/2022, 22:15:20] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[15/11/2022, 22:15:35] Alex Regueiro: They'll put up a "bubble" on the outside courts soon though
[15/11/2022, 22:15:49] Alex Regueiro: It was decent thanks. Served well enough at least
[15/11/2022, 22:19:51] Alice Lafferty: I see. If it's technically possible is it not exploitable in some way? If you tinker with the starting conditions of a system can't you influence its trajectory?
[15/11/2022, 22:20:16] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'll see if I can get a copy.
[15/11/2022, 22:20:27] Alice Lafferty: We're being such huge snobs!
[15/11/2022, 22:21:42] Alex Regueiro: üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 22:21:51] Alex Regueiro: Or you're welcome to borrow mine.
[15/11/2022, 22:22:40] Alex Regueiro: It's not exploitable in that it's too rare to be of any use once you average it out over long timescales.
[15/11/2022, 22:22:56] Alex Regueiro: Have you encountered Maxwell's Daemon in your reading? That's a great thought experiment.
[15/11/2022, 22:23:20] Alex Regueiro: And you can grasp it well without knowing the mathematics really
[15/11/2022, 22:23:29] Alice Lafferty: True. Thinking of Hatfield.
[15/11/2022, 22:24:05] Alice Lafferty: There are also really nice places to go in the Chilterns, which are reachable from me. But that is getting quite far away from you.
[15/11/2022, 22:24:24] Alice Lafferty: I haven't? I'll look it up.
[15/11/2022, 22:25:12] Alice Lafferty: I don't mind walking in the cold particularly
[15/11/2022, 22:25:17] Alex Regueiro: We are, but it's still a pretty accurate stereotype, isn't it? Loughton has transformed from a lovely Essex village 60/70 years ago into a London suburb full of nouveau riche eastenders. üò¨ (We have a lovely 95 year old neighbour who's seen it all.)
[15/11/2022, 22:26:19] Alex Regueiro: I have to be frank: I was never going to find my match without going a bit afield. One of the few benefits of online dating.
[15/11/2022, 22:27:01] Alex Regueiro: Nor do I. And at least it's not meant to rain Saturday... somewhat sunny?
[15/11/2022, 22:27:10] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes. It's kind of sad when you can just make out the heart of the old villages, now encroached upon by housing estates etc.
[15/11/2022, 22:27:28] Alex Regueiro: Ooh nice. Can you get there on train? It's a bit far from here but something I should keep in mind yep.
[15/11/2022, 22:28:39] Alex Regueiro: Hah yep. Most of Loughton is nice enough architecturally. The housing estates are confined to Debden here, which Loughtonians insist is another town, and they insist is just part of Loughton!
[15/11/2022, 22:28:49] Alice Lafferty: You can but it's a 1.5hour + journey each way, and longer for you I think. Not really feasible. Frustrating because it's only ~30 minutes in the car.
[15/11/2022, 22:29:09] Alex Regueiro: And yes, Hatfield House is marvellous
[15/11/2022, 22:29:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I really need to get a car to drive again. I have a licence after all.
[15/11/2022, 22:29:39] Alex Regueiro: Depends how soon I move
[15/11/2022, 22:29:41] Alice Lafferty: It's not too bad, we basically live in the same general vicinity. Matched with a guy who only after several days revealed he was actually in Munich.
[15/11/2022, 22:30:18] Alice Lafferty: They have different tube stations right? That basically counts...
[15/11/2022, 22:30:22] Alex Regueiro: Hah yeah. We should consider ourselves fortunate really.
[15/11/2022, 22:31:04] Alex Regueiro: Did you call it quits immediately then?
[15/11/2022, 22:31:07] Alice Lafferty: And I need to get a licence to begin with!
[15/11/2022, 22:31:26] Alex Regueiro: I've tried a long-distance relationship. It's as difficult as they say.
[15/11/2022, 22:31:27] Alice Lafferty: Is this something you're considering in the near-term then?
[15/11/2022, 22:32:02] Alex Regueiro: I was, but I don't think it's feasible now given where the housing market is. So I don't think it will happen for minimum a year, probably more.
[15/11/2022, 22:32:06] Alice Lafferty: Yes, because he'd been kind of misleading on his profile.
[15/11/2022, 22:32:32] Alice Lafferty: How large was the distance?
[15/11/2022, 22:32:38] Alex Regueiro: Nicht k√ºl
[15/11/2022, 22:32:49] Alex Regueiro: Northern Italy
[15/11/2022, 22:33:02] Alex Regueiro: Are you learning?
[15/11/2022, 22:33:15] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's a good point!
[15/11/2022, 22:34:21] Alice Lafferty: I would say if anything that housing prices are forecast to collapse over the next year or so. So it may be a buyer's market.
[15/11/2022, 22:34:33] Alice Lafferty: But mortgage rates are very high...
[15/11/2022, 22:34:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, they already are, but I'm more looking to rent for now
[15/11/2022, 22:34:52] Alex Regueiro: and rents are staying high
[15/11/2022, 22:34:58] Alex Regueiro: That too
[15/11/2022, 22:35:30] Alice Lafferty: Oh! üò¨ Yes I don't really see how those kinds of relationships work.
[15/11/2022, 22:36:02] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it never got too serious, and... well, I shouldn't really talk about it. Not now. üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 22:36:04] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm going to have to start looking into this as well at some point. Seems overwhelming.
[15/11/2022, 22:36:27] Alice Lafferty: No, I don't even have a provisional driver's licence.
[15/11/2022, 22:37:00] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Don't mean to pry!
[15/11/2022, 22:37:02] Alex Regueiro: It is a little, but I think the main hurdle is getting started. You're in no particular rush though, right?
[15/11/2022, 22:37:27] Alice Lafferty: No, I've fortunate to have very generous parents I suppose.
[15/11/2022, 22:37:45] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. It's just they say it's a big faux pas to talk about it with someone you're still getting to know. And I can see why
[15/11/2022, 22:38:45] Alex Regueiro: Same. I've been in and out a bit, doing whatever's convenient. I'm fortunate I have some savings and a few income sources too. Fingers crossed.
[15/11/2022, 22:39:32] Alice Lafferty: I can see that I guess.
[15/11/2022, 22:40:15] Alex Regueiro: It doesn't bother me personally though. It's actually kind of nice we've been candid with each other. That you have next to no experience, and I have very little for my age. üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 22:40:27] Alice Lafferty: It's an attractive idea to move out once and for all and feel established as a proper adult I suppose.
[15/11/2022, 22:40:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. The independence does feel good, I attest to that
[15/11/2022, 22:40:57] Alice Lafferty: Haha yeah. I've totally failed to create an aura of mystery.
[15/11/2022, 22:41:20] Alex Regueiro: I'll make it permanent at a more convenient time for my life and finances!
[15/11/2022, 22:42:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes I'm sure. It's also not at all unusual for your/our generation.
[15/11/2022, 22:42:11] Alex Regueiro: Haha I'm sure there's still plenty of interesting things to get to know about you! Of other kinds.
[15/11/2022, 22:42:15] Alex Regueiro: Likewise here, I'd hope
[15/11/2022, 22:42:38] Alex Regueiro: It beats being deceived regardless
[15/11/2022, 22:43:41] Alice Lafferty: I'm quite boring as a person. Guess that makes me good to project onto.
[15/11/2022, 22:43:57] Alice Lafferty: Yes definitely
[15/11/2022, 22:45:18] Alex Regueiro: Hah. I can't agree though. You're not wild / hugely outgoing, but I know what I'm looking for by now, and it's not that!
[15/11/2022, 22:45:33] Alex Regueiro: (Can't agree with the boring bit, that is)
[15/11/2022, 22:45:37] Alice Lafferty: Anyway, you probably only really get to know someone in gory detail when you've lived with them.
[15/11/2022, 22:45:50] Alex Regueiro: That's true to some extent
[15/11/2022, 22:46:01] Alex Regueiro: I mean, you'll see all their foibles then
[15/11/2022, 22:46:03] Alex Regueiro: guaranteed
[15/11/2022, 22:46:42] Alex Regueiro: But my theory is, as long as its sufficiently offset by the love/fondness, it will work
[15/11/2022, 22:47:15] Alice Lafferty: I bet people maintain quite long-term relationships under  the illusion their partner gets out of bed wearing makeup/always keeps their house tidy, or whatever...
[15/11/2022, 22:47:26] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[15/11/2022, 22:47:31] Alice Lafferty: And maybe some more serious things!
[15/11/2022, 22:47:33] Alex Regueiro: I suspect you're right
[15/11/2022, 22:48:40] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if it's sensible to rely on the emotion to sustain the relationship. I'm kind of pessimistic about this stuff though as I think I've already expressed!
[15/11/2022, 22:49:00] Alex Regueiro: "Serious" is so 20th C though
[15/11/2022, 22:49:19] Alice Lafferty: How do you mean?
[15/11/2022, 22:49:45] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it isn't really, but... sadly can seem that way sometimes. Have friends/acquaintances across the spectrum though. In terms of how seriously/frivolously they treat relationships and dating. Not that spectrum!
[15/11/2022, 22:51:00] Alex Regueiro: Yes, you've made yourself quite clear ha. But that's alright, part of me is too. I equivocate on this. I still think you need some sort of romantic bond at the start, probably.
[15/11/2022, 22:51:00] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, we can afford to treat sexual relationships frivolously because of contraception. But for some people there is a kind of emotional price paid too.
[15/11/2022, 22:51:20] Alex Regueiro: Right
[15/11/2022, 22:51:31] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever read any Philip Larkin out of interest?
[15/11/2022, 22:51:48] Alex Regueiro: I'd say for most people even. Casual sex is super difficult at a psychological level (I'm told), and only a rare type can do it, especially among women
[15/11/2022, 22:52:05] Alex Regueiro: Only bits and pieces here and there. I think I'd like him though.
[15/11/2022, 22:52:09] Alex Regueiro: Do you?
[15/11/2022, 22:52:50] Alex Regueiro: Partly because he was such a maverick, perhaps. They'd call him "based" today, I think!
[15/11/2022, 22:52:51] Alice Lafferty: I think the actual prevalence of casual sex must be hugely overestimated.
[15/11/2022, 22:53:22] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure you've heard that the trend is decidedly downards for millennials and (especially) gen Z.
[15/11/2022, 22:54:27] Alice Lafferty: He's sort of articulates my life philosophy in some ways. Also the most technically gifted poets of the 2nd half of the 20th century. Just consistently astonishing.
[15/11/2022, 22:54:29] Alex Regueiro: I'd say it's become an increasingly bimodal distribution compared to pre Sexual Revolution
[15/11/2022, 22:54:55] Alex Regueiro: I'm frankly amazed he hasn't been (properly) cancelled yet... but glad.
[15/11/2022, 22:55:20] Alex Regueiro: Feel free to send me a few poems of his you particularly like... If you'd be so kind, that is.
[15/11/2022, 22:55:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes. On the ground it seems that way. About 1/4 girls I know have steady boyfriends, another 1/4 are in some liminal relationship/pining after some boy, and the rest just have their head down working.
[15/11/2022, 22:56:30] Alex Regueiro: At Cambridge? I wonder if the distribution is particularly different to the average there. Possibly. But that doesn't surprise me regardless.
[15/11/2022, 22:56:39] Alice Lafferty: Although this is not representative because people I socialise with (when I do) are pre-selected for more introverted/cautious personality traits.
[15/11/2022, 22:57:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes I'm sure that's right. Maybe more accurate if you change the 1/4s to 1/3.
[15/11/2022, 22:57:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I realise that's the same here. I've had very few friends (male or female) whom I'd call outright promiscuous.
[15/11/2022, 22:57:48] Alice Lafferty: He kind of gets the evil eye for some antisemitic stuff he wrote. But there's nothing that objectionable in the actual content of his poems so.
[15/11/2022, 22:58:36] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I didn't even remember that. I thought it was more about the "darkies" and the misogynistic stuff. Though it's really hard to tell how how much is sincere, I gather?
[15/11/2022, 22:58:37] Alice Lafferty: Maybe at certain social strata there is a lot more casual sex happening and we just don't know?
[15/11/2022, 22:59:18] Alex Regueiro: Andrew Motion kind of inadvertently ruined his friend's legacy with the biography he wrote after his death.
[15/11/2022, 22:59:58] Alex Regueiro: It used to be that would be largely confined to the working class and some sectors of the upper class, while "middle class morality" dominated. But I think that might be a tad outdated...
[15/11/2022, 23:00:16] Alex Regueiro: Right, I've heard that too
[15/11/2022, 23:00:32] Alice Lafferty: The misogyny is really quite mild for the time. I find it forgivable in him because I kind of understand where he's coming from. I indulged in a little misandry myself when faced with sexual rejectionü§∑
[15/11/2022, 23:01:01] Alice Lafferty: Least annoying poet laureate.
[15/11/2022, 23:01:15] Alex Regueiro: It's a natural response yeah. Most of the dodgy-sounding stuff is from his diary or letters eh?
[15/11/2022, 23:01:40] Alex Regueiro: God, I studied Duffy and Armitage for GCSE before either became poet laureate, and couldn't stand them. Still can't.
[15/11/2022, 23:01:42] Alice Lafferty: The racism yes. And he had a huge stash of pornography.
[15/11/2022, 23:02:01] Alex Regueiro: I usually hear good things about Betjeman from people I respect, but I know nothing.
[15/11/2022, 23:02:04] Alice Lafferty: Haha I actually like Armitage!
[15/11/2022, 23:02:23] Alex Regueiro: Fair!
[15/11/2022, 23:02:39] Alex Regueiro: Okay, so I say "still can't", but I haven't really looked at their poetry since GCSE
[15/11/2022, 23:02:40] Alice Lafferty: Are there any three words more depressing than carol ann duffy...
[15/11/2022, 23:02:55] Alex Regueiro: Just remember thinking Armitage was a bit dull, and Duffy was even worse, drier.
[15/11/2022, 23:03:21] Alice Lafferty: Some of Armitage's stuff is quite moving.
[15/11/2022, 23:03:29] Alice Lafferty: But I am a bit sentimental.
[15/11/2022, 23:03:42] Alex Regueiro: To be honest I never got particularly into poetry. The odd poem really moved me, but most, no.
[15/11/2022, 23:03:51] Alex Regueiro: Okay you really have to send me some of your favourites then!
[15/11/2022, 23:03:53] Alex Regueiro: Larkin or otherwise
[15/11/2022, 23:04:29] Alice Lafferty: That's ok, 99% of all published poetry is schlock!
[15/11/2022, 23:04:37] Alex Regueiro: You can pass the love poems off as your own if you like. I won't complain. üëÄ
[15/11/2022, 23:04:43] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[15/11/2022, 23:04:53] Alex Regueiro: Verily
[15/11/2022, 23:04:54] Alice Lafferty: You know, love poems never really do it for me.
[15/11/2022, 23:04:59] Alex Regueiro: Nor me
[15/11/2022, 23:05:05] Alice Lafferty: They embarrass me to read.
[15/11/2022, 23:05:06] Alex Regueiro: So, excellent. We're on the same page
[15/11/2022, 23:05:31] Alice Lafferty: Unless they're extremely extremely restrained.
[15/11/2022, 23:05:42] Alex Regueiro: I think my poetic high point was winning a prize for reading in primary school
[15/11/2022, 23:05:47] Alex Regueiro: "If"
[15/11/2022, 23:06:16] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever read Arundel Tomb by Larkin?
[15/11/2022, 23:06:22] Alex Regueiro: Victorian then, perhaps?
[15/11/2022, 23:06:22] Alice Lafferty: Tolerable love poem.
[15/11/2022, 23:06:27] Alex Regueiro: I haven't
[15/11/2022, 23:06:32] Alex Regueiro: That's a good recommendation to start
[15/11/2022, 23:06:38] Alice Lafferty: What no! The victorians are ultra sentimental, ultra syrupy.
[15/11/2022, 23:06:50] Alex Regueiro: Shows what I know.
[15/11/2022, 23:07:03] Alice Lafferty: Sorry!
[15/11/2022, 23:07:07] Alex Regueiro: I just guessed Restoration and Georgian poets would be even worse!
[15/11/2022, 23:07:45] Alice Lafferty: It's all very like: 'your eyes are like the sky, my heart is like a dove' whatever whatvet
[15/11/2022, 23:08:04] Alex Regueiro: What do you think of Keats?
‚Äé[15/11/2022, 23:08:55] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[15/11/2022, 23:09:00] Alice Lafferty: Bit of realism.
[15/11/2022, 23:09:40] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes I remember that one.
[15/11/2022, 23:09:41] Alex Regueiro: Lovely
[15/11/2022, 23:09:51] Alice Lafferty: Kind of sappy! Sorry. Also 'truth is beauty and beauty truth' is one of the most silliest ideas to ever enter public consciousness.
[15/11/2022, 23:09:53] Alex Regueiro: Was it actually written about Anne Hathaway or not?
[15/11/2022, 23:10:04] Alex Regueiro: Don't be sorry. I was testing you. Can't stand him myself
[15/11/2022, 23:10:15] Alex Regueiro: Wordsworth is... okay. Coleridge too I think? Byron, no thanks
[15/11/2022, 23:10:19] Alice Lafferty: I don't know. He had several on the go, including a young man.
[15/11/2022, 23:10:20] Alex Regueiro: but my memory is hazy in any case
[15/11/2022, 23:10:37] Alice Lafferty: I actually really like the Rime of the Ancient Mariner
[15/11/2022, 23:10:59] Alex Regueiro: Alas, I never got that sort of juicy info in school...
[15/11/2022, 23:11:08] Alex Regueiro: I've only read part, but I'm with you
[15/11/2022, 23:11:46] Alice Lafferty: I know.. did you ever get into the Shakespeare attribution controversies? This is a special interest of mine too.
[15/11/2022, 23:11:47] Alex Regueiro: The last long poem I read was probably the Divine Comedy. Like most people I bailed after the Inferno. A bit harsh perhaps.
[15/11/2022, 23:12:08] Alice Lafferty: Never read it either although it directly pertains to my studies and is on my reading list!
[15/11/2022, 23:12:28] Alex Regueiro: I researched it a little myself, but am largely persuaded by the boring orthodox attribution... even if I'm somewhat open to be shown otherwise.
[15/11/2022, 23:12:56] Alice Lafferty: I always think about Satan being suspended upside down in ice in the centre of Hell, it's such a striking image.
[15/11/2022, 23:13:16] Alex Regueiro: It's pretty entertaining, though you kind of need a historical reference alongside it, for all the 13th C name dropping he does.
[15/11/2022, 23:13:28] Alex Regueiro: That's Judas! Suspended from Satan
[15/11/2022, 23:13:46] Alex Regueiro: But yes, great imagery
[15/11/2022, 23:14:10] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I have to say the Earl of Oxford theory is very fun. Involves lots of encoded messages and invisible ink type of stuff.
[15/11/2022, 23:14:14] Alex Regueiro: BTW, I do recommend the Longfellow translation if you want to read it at some point
[15/11/2022, 23:14:42] Alex Regueiro: Oh cool. I think that's the most prominent one yes? rings a bell at least
[15/11/2022, 23:16:12] Alice Lafferty: Is it not Satan too?: 
The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
(This is from the Longfellow translation)
[15/11/2022, 23:16:35] Alice Lafferty: Yes, after Stratfordian & Baconian.
[15/11/2022, 23:17:06] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, Satan is there in the lake of hell. He's holding three men, I think Judas upside down from his mouth...
[15/11/2022, 23:17:12] Alex Regueiro: Brutus is one of the others, if I recall
[15/11/2022, 23:17:16] Alex Regueiro: Forget the third
[15/11/2022, 23:17:36] Alice Lafferty: Cassius
[15/11/2022, 23:17:53] Alex Regueiro: You know better than me and you haven't even read it!
[15/11/2022, 23:17:56] Alex Regueiro: Makes perfect sense
[15/11/2022, 23:18:16] Alice Lafferty: I really don't!
[15/11/2022, 23:18:24] Alice Lafferty: I'm just trying to think of Larkin poems.
[15/11/2022, 23:18:29] Alex Regueiro: okay üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 23:18:51] Alice Lafferty: It's difficult to pick one because it's more like an attitude that pervades the entire body of work.
[15/11/2022, 23:19:25] Alice Lafferty: https://allpoetry.com/Love-Songs-In-Age
[15/11/2022, 23:19:38] Alice Lafferty: This is good.
[15/11/2022, 23:19:57] Alex Regueiro: Thank you
[15/11/2022, 23:20:06] Alex Regueiro: I'll read that an An Arundel Tomb
[15/11/2022, 23:20:20] Alex Regueiro: ...and any others you might send, but don't feel obliged.
[15/11/2022, 23:20:28] Alex Regueiro: Have you seen Dead Poets' Society?
[15/11/2022, 23:21:11] Alice Lafferty: There are so many... I think you might enjoy Aubade as well. https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48422/aubade-56d229a6e2f07
[15/11/2022, 23:21:19] Alice Lafferty: I haven't, is it good?
[15/11/2022, 23:21:50] Alex Regueiro: Aubade... that's a nice piece by Poulenc. Sounds good.
[15/11/2022, 23:22:44] Alex Regueiro: Wonderful. My English teacher at school actually introduced us to some stuff.
[15/11/2022, 23:23:43] Alice Lafferty: He's very quotable. I love what he said about having children: 'Why did we think adding meant increase? To me it meant dilution'.
[15/11/2022, 23:24:10] Alex Regueiro: hah
[15/11/2022, 23:24:56] Alice Lafferty: Some of these I've had stuck in my head every day for fiveish years. But I'm going to stop because I think I'm inadequately conveying my meaning...
[15/11/2022, 23:25:37] Alex Regueiro: So you're not a big fan of children I take it?
[15/11/2022, 23:25:53] Alex Regueiro: No no, it's fine. But in any case I'll read these poems and get back to you.
[15/11/2022, 23:26:28] Alice Lafferty: Good teachers make all the difference.
[15/11/2022, 23:27:16] Alex Regueiro: They really do. I found it was especially important in English and History, since I always had the innate attraction to maths, science, and foreign languages.
[15/11/2022, 23:27:22] Alice Lafferty: I'm kind of ambivalent. But I have to say that when I first read that line it struck me as immediately true.
[15/11/2022, 23:30:13] Alex Regueiro: Fair enough. While I personally can't stand most other people's children, I do realise that many people fulfil themselves and find some amount of genuine meaning through having children. I don't think the modern hedonistic/narcissistic attitude to life is superior in any way, at least. Equally, having a large family doesn't sound particularly fun. And I do believe it's possible for people to have a very meaningful and worthy life without children (even if it's not the norm).
[15/11/2022, 23:31:09] Alice Lafferty: He wrote something else similiar about observing parents in a park with their children:
'Their beauty has thickened.
Something is pushing them
To the side of their own lives.'
[15/11/2022, 23:31:15] Alice Lafferty: From 'Afternoons'.
[15/11/2022, 23:31:33] Alice Lafferty: Yes that seems to be the consensus.
[15/11/2022, 23:32:08] Alice Lafferty: I can understand it intellectually but I'm worried that it won't 'work' for me.
[15/11/2022, 23:32:12] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure most people think about it, but it sounds roughly right to me. Still keeping my mind as open as possible!
[15/11/2022, 23:32:51] Alex Regueiro: Statistically, the regret of not having children is far more prevalent than the regret of having children... though I agree it very much depends on the person.
[15/11/2022, 23:33:04] Alex Regueiro: I used to be almost abhorred by the idea myself. Much less now.
[15/11/2022, 23:33:51] Alice Lafferty: I have very mixed feelings about it personally.
[15/11/2022, 23:34:31] Alex Regueiro: That's quite a depressing vision of parenthood, yes. I think it's true in part, but also may not be fair to the deep satisfaction parents derive for their "sacrifice" (of their own lives, in some way)
[15/11/2022, 23:35:24] Alice Lafferty: This is the precisely the point. I believe that the satisfaction other/most people feel from parenting is genuine.
[15/11/2022, 23:35:26] Alex Regueiro: And that sounds perfectly sensible for a woman of your age (or older even). I suspect they'll evolve over time, in one direction or another, but who can predict...
[15/11/2022, 23:36:21] Alice Lafferty: But I've found generally that I am unable to find meaning in things other people do. I kind of suspect parenthood will be the same.
[15/11/2022, 23:36:46] Alice Lafferty: Sacrifice is the right word, yes.
[15/11/2022, 23:36:50] Alex Regueiro: Yes, both the hard and anecdotal evidence seems pretty clear. I'll definitely accept it's not for everyone, but one of the things I dislike about fully-fledged feminism is it's rejection of hardwired biological sources of meaning/fulfilment.
[15/11/2022, 23:37:29] Alice Lafferty: My concerns have nothing to do with feminism.
[15/11/2022, 23:38:04] Alex Regueiro: And I've definitely grown to appreciate the idea that (partial) sacrifice of oneself for a higher cause (don't think religious necessarily) is essential to a meaningful and worthwhile life. That "higher cause" can take many different forms though, children and descendants just being one of them, a common one.
[15/11/2022, 23:38:14] Alex Regueiro: Oh I never thought that. I was just musing...
[15/11/2022, 23:38:19] Alice Lafferty: It seems like the vast majority of men and women basically desire to have children and then care for those children as they grow up.
[15/11/2022, 23:39:00] Alex Regueiro: It does seem. Just slight variations in the strength or timing of those urges.
[15/11/2022, 23:39:08] Alice Lafferty: We may as well call it 'biological'.
[15/11/2022, 23:39:51] Alice Lafferty: It's quite an easy thing to say. The mother's sacrifice is much greater than the father's.
[15/11/2022, 23:40:11] Alex Regueiro: The really interesting a very modern trend is towards asexuality. I mean, it's always existed, but it's being promoted as an explicit ideology these days. Not only that you don't need children to have a fulfilling life, but you don't need romance or a partner.
[15/11/2022, 23:40:40] Alice Lafferty: Some small percentage of people are genuine asexuals I believe.
[15/11/2022, 23:40:52] Alice Lafferty: I think it's a matter of de-emphasis?
[15/11/2022, 23:40:58] Alex Regueiro: And I'm on board with the idea there's huge natural variation in this need among people, but also that it's very rare not to have at least a moderate need, and this idea can adversely affect people, perhaps. I speak partly from personal experience!
[15/11/2022, 23:41:17] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure. As far as I can tell Big Romance is still being pushed quite hard.
[15/11/2022, 23:41:34] Alex Regueiro: Certainly. But it's objectively tiny. De-emphasis is not worrying, but emphasis on the negation of the traditional view is cause for some concern
[15/11/2022, 23:42:31] Alice Lafferty: I don't know, can a strong platonic bond(s) be as meaningful as a romantic one?
[15/11/2022, 23:43:17] Alex Regueiro: There's a lot of baggage in our society, yes. But it's less... or just different from before? Perhaps the expectation and social pressure is still large, it's just more about some idealised abstracted notion of love, very individualistic and ethereal, rather than any pragmatic notion of love and partnership, or children. Which I find both liberating to an extent, and a bit concerning in its excessive idealism.
[15/11/2022, 23:43:49] Alex Regueiro: Meaningful? Yes, for me. But qualitatively quite different. What do you think?
[15/11/2022, 23:44:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I mean I think Valentine's day, romantic comedies, dating shows, are still going as strong as ever. Nobody's selling '50 years of work and commitment and sacrifice'.
[15/11/2022, 23:44:44] Alex Regueiro: I come back to Newton. I would never dare claim he had anything less than an immensely meaningful life, despite being fully asexual (as far as people can tell) and having very few friends.
[15/11/2022, 23:45:35] Alex Regueiro: True, but is this not merely the commodification of love? That bothers me very much. All the more that it coexist with some sort of implicit platonic idealism (in the philosophical sense!) about romance.
[15/11/2022, 23:46:13] Alice Lafferty: I don't know. Hopefully this doesn't scare you off but to be completely honest I haven't had a strong platonic bond since I was a very young child, nor a romantic one. I can't detect a strong difference between them.
[15/11/2022, 23:46:59] Alice Lafferty: In general I've not found the of fruits friendships to be worth the huge social energy expenditure.
[15/11/2022, 23:47:07] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. I'm kind of relieved, because I think the line between the two is kind of blurry for me too.
[15/11/2022, 23:47:10] Alice Lafferty: But again more than prepared to admit this is unusual.
[15/11/2022, 23:48:04] Alex Regueiro: Maybe because I value the intellect so highly compared to normal. But I also have to admit, I'm not capable of putting aside the appearance or emotional connection when it comes to romance. (So it seems)
[15/11/2022, 23:48:21] Alice Lafferty: Yes, there's a sense in which you have to make stunning contributions to science or art or whatever, in order to 'compensate' for not having children. Otherwise you're just kind of a lonely old person.
[15/11/2022, 23:48:37] Alice Lafferty: I believe Newton must have derived great meaning from his work?
[15/11/2022, 23:48:45] Alex Regueiro: You mean childhood friendships and crushes were your last things on both couns?
[15/11/2022, 23:49:17] Alex Regueiro: Enormous. And I think that's totally viable, albeit to the extent he did... for a minuscule portion of people.
[15/11/2022, 23:49:24] Alex Regueiro: I actually thought I might be that way myself for some time
[15/11/2022, 23:49:42] Alice Lafferty: I know. I think it has more than anything made people's expectations too high.
[15/11/2022, 23:50:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes. And I cannot count crushes as true romantic bonds because they were generally idealisations of people.
[15/11/2022, 23:50:57] Alex Regueiro: We might be doing a salon on this topic in the future. The woman who proposed it is really eccentric to the point of crazy (and sometimes annoying), but I actually think it's a great topic.
[15/11/2022, 23:51:31] Alex Regueiro: Right, I agree... so do you think you've ever had a true romantic bond? Or you meant a true platonic bond in your childhood? üôÇ
[15/11/2022, 23:52:06] Alice Lafferty: The problem is whether or not one is brilliant enough to justify a life totally devoted to intellectual work.
[15/11/2022, 23:52:38] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[15/11/2022, 23:52:51] Alex Regueiro: And I had the great disappointment of discovering I was not, in due course!
[15/11/2022, 23:52:59] Alex Regueiro: Well, I've long since come to terms with it hah
[15/11/2022, 23:53:09] Alex Regueiro: It can still be a large component though, I reckon
[15/11/2022, 23:53:52] Alice Lafferty: I suspect for me I am neither clever enough to really produce any meaningful work, nor truly emotionally receptive enough to find satisfaction in family.
[15/11/2022, 23:54:20] Alice Lafferty: :( so kind of worst of both worlds.
[15/11/2022, 23:54:20] Alex Regueiro: That's so pessimistic! I mean, I see where you're coming from but... does it depress you?
[15/11/2022, 23:54:51] Alice Lafferty: Well, like you said, I imagine it's a matter of coming to terms with it.
[15/11/2022, 23:54:57] Alex Regueiro: I think your solution will be to find your meaning from a combination of sources, and intellect and emotional connection will both play roles. Not in a remotely "typical" proportion. Perhaps I'm projecting myself, but I do get that feeling.
[15/11/2022, 23:55:19] Alex Regueiro: Maybe Fraenkel's book will give you some clarity! We can hope.
[15/11/2022, 23:56:00] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to leave you with one final Larkin quote (sorry!) My favourite (not the most technically brilliant, but my favourite): 

Isolate rather this element
That spreads through other lives like a tree   
And sways them on in a sort of sense   
And say why it never worked for me.
[15/11/2022, 23:56:55] Alex Regueiro: That's beautiful
[15/11/2022, 23:57:00] Alice Lafferty: I will not send anymore.
[15/11/2022, 23:57:01] Alex Regueiro: I get it
[15/11/2022, 23:57:05] Alice Lafferty: I promise
[15/11/2022, 23:57:08] Alex Regueiro: Very much so
[15/11/2022, 23:57:14] Alex Regueiro: At least, I hope I do!
[15/11/2022, 23:57:21] Alex Regueiro: No no, I really appreciate it
[15/11/2022, 23:57:22] Alice Lafferty: Yes, isn't it
[15/11/2022, 23:58:00] Alex Regueiro: Like I said, I've never been captivated by poetry as a discipline, but the odd poem really speaks to me. And some song lyrics I love are basically poems, so why not?
[15/11/2022, 23:58:04] Alice Lafferty: This is what I was getting at when you were talking about deriving satisfaction from children.
[15/11/2022, 23:58:16] Alex Regueiro: Does "leave you with" mean you want to go to bed now? I shan't keep you if so.
[15/11/2022, 23:58:28] Alice Lafferty: Yes song lyrics are most definitely 'literature'.
[15/11/2022, 23:59:02] Alex Regueiro: I'm mainly commenting about norms. But realising our own deviations from these norms, sometimes in extreme ways ‚Äì but not always ‚Äì is a terribly important chapter to life.
[15/11/2022, 23:59:20] Alex Regueiro: They are, just don't get me going about Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize. I think even he was a bit embarrassed.
[15/11/2022, 23:59:24] Alice Lafferty: I was just going to draw things to a close because I can feel myself starting to complain basically.
[15/11/2022, 23:59:30] Alice Lafferty: Or mope
[16/11/2022, 00:00:25] Alex Regueiro: Oh, that's fair. I wish I could cheer you up... but I fear I may be reinforcing your tenets here, even if I push back in small ways!
[16/11/2022, 00:00:59] Alice Lafferty: Good, I can admit now in confidence that I never got the hype around Bob Dylan at all... 'you're alone, like a rolling stone'. OK? Is that great literature?
[16/11/2022, 00:01:54] Alice Lafferty: It's ok, not your job at all.
[16/11/2022, 00:02:37] Alex Regueiro: All I shall say now is: this doesn't deter me. Partly because I sympathise with you (and your feeling of alienation or such), partly because you very fairly honourably hinted at these things when we first started talking, and partly because I like a good challenge!
[16/11/2022, 00:03:01] Alex Regueiro: And indeed it's a process of discovery for me too.
[16/11/2022, 00:03:19] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, it's difficult to share things that are important to you because they always come out seeming smaller or less impressive than they were in your head, somehow.
[16/11/2022, 00:03:53] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. I never got it either. Much came across like pretentious twaddle that everyone thinks has more depth than it does.
[16/11/2022, 00:03:59] Alice Lafferty: I mean, maybe it was inappropriate to unload this on you since we don't know each other that well?
[16/11/2022, 00:04:04] Alex Regueiro: It's not my job, but it's my wish.
[16/11/2022, 00:05:07] Alex Regueiro: No. Don't worry. Much of our discussion was meta-level anyway. It's hard to ignore the undertone of how it might apply to us, but I'm not really concerned about that, trust me. üôÇ
[16/11/2022, 00:05:18] Alice Lafferty: But I figured there was no point wasting your time if you're looking for like a nice maternal figure to enthusiastically have 6 children with or something.
[16/11/2022, 00:05:37] Alice Lafferty: Not that it's an unreasonable thing to want by the way!
[16/11/2022, 00:06:31] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I've been trying to take things fairly gently and let us both explore our feelings and views about it all. Especially you, because it's maybe more novel to you, but also me!
[16/11/2022, 00:06:32] Alice Lafferty: I'm not writing anything off yet, I won't until I'm a bit older.
[16/11/2022, 00:07:01] Alex Regueiro: Haha no, it's good. I'm not sure whether I'll want children yet, like I said. I'm open to it right now, but I'm not in a particular rush.
[16/11/2022, 00:07:29] Alex Regueiro: It's good to get this sort of thing out of the way like you say. Clear the air.
[16/11/2022, 00:08:08] Alice Lafferty: Oh, I got the impression from what you said that you were very much in favour.
[16/11/2022, 00:08:19] Alex Regueiro: I'm in favour of it as a social norm
[16/11/2022, 00:08:30] Alex Regueiro: extremely
[16/11/2022, 00:08:45] Alex Regueiro: At a personal level, I'm open to it, but not quite powerfully motivated right now
[16/11/2022, 00:08:47] Alex Regueiro: Does that make sense?
[16/11/2022, 00:09:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes that makes sense.
[16/11/2022, 00:09:06] Alex Regueiro: I suspect C. S. Lewis might have said something along these lines, despite never having a child of his own!
[16/11/2022, 00:09:56] Alice Lafferty: Probably. Now that you've mentioned it I should go back and re-read him if I want a more optimistic view of marriage.
[16/11/2022, 00:10:21] Alice Lafferty: He and his wife seemed to have the healthiest relationship I've ever seen described in literature.
[16/11/2022, 00:11:42] Alex Regueiro: I should say, I've read my fair share of horrific stories of family/parental life as an amateur genealogist! My great-grandmother and her mother had really tragic lives in that regard, so I'm very far from an unmitigated optimist. And it wasn't a great deal better or easier for their husbands!
[16/11/2022, 00:12:16] Alice Lafferty: You would think it would have pro-social effects, but does it really? Are people with children really less selfish or less materialistic than those without? Anecdotally I haven't found it to be the case.
[16/11/2022, 00:12:17] Alex Regueiro: I mainly know about it from the film Shadow Lands. (Another I highly recommend.) But yes, I think that's right
[16/11/2022, 00:13:12] Alice Lafferty: Oh what happened? (if you don't mind sharing?)
[16/11/2022, 00:13:12] Alex Regueiro: I think it's a healthier society where more people find more meaning, and I think having children is an essential component for a large portion. It's also objectively good for the propagation of the human race, and in most cases the economy, so there's that!
[16/11/2022, 00:13:41] Alex Regueiro: I'd rather tell you in person, if that's alright? Would find it much easier.
[16/11/2022, 00:14:22] Alice Lafferty: Re the economy, it seems to be not the absolute fertility rate that matters, but the ratio of productive to unproductive works (eg pensioners).
[16/11/2022, 00:14:42] Alice Lafferty: So yes, we (the West) either need to have more children or seriously reorientate the economy.
[16/11/2022, 00:14:57] Alice Lafferty: To a kind of 'degrowth' model.
[16/11/2022, 00:15:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes of course
[16/11/2022, 00:15:11] Alex Regueiro: Yes, the age profile is arguably even more important. But humanity/nations need to propagate regardless, and usually having a larger workforce allows for more specialisation... though I suspect the advantages tail off rapidly after a certain size.
[16/11/2022, 00:15:42] Alex Regueiro: I have a lot of sympathy for the degrowth model in some respects... not all. It's the sort of people who usually advocate it and their motives that bother me though!
[16/11/2022, 00:16:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes it's the net zero people mainly.
[16/11/2022, 00:16:18] Alice Lafferty: Which is a shame because I think it just suffers from bad PR.
[16/11/2022, 00:16:19] Alex Regueiro: Right, or the "humans are a virus to the Earth" crowd of fanatics.
[16/11/2022, 00:16:30] Alex Regueiro: which overlap
[16/11/2022, 00:16:34] Alice Lafferty: 'Ecofascists'
[16/11/2022, 00:16:51] Alex Regueiro: Don't get me going heh...
[16/11/2022, 00:17:44] Alex Regueiro: Although to be honest I object to that term, and the bandying around of words like "fascist" (or "liberal") these days anyway.
[16/11/2022, 00:20:00] Alice Lafferty: Well, sorry again for making you listen to all of my issues this evening and forcing ten Philip Larkin quotes down your throat. 

It has made me wonder though whether we'd be better off as friends? Maybe I wouldn't slot very well into the general conservative family-based future you're mapping out.
[16/11/2022, 00:20:26] Alex Regueiro: No worries
[16/11/2022, 00:20:40] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, I think you misunderstand me still, sorry...
[16/11/2022, 00:20:52] Alice Lafferty: There's actually been a weird schism on the left between those who want to reduce the population (for the climate) and those who regard any such calls as tantamount to eugenics.
[16/11/2022, 00:20:53] Alex Regueiro: I'm saying these things are probably good for society as a whole.
[16/11/2022, 00:21:01] Alex Regueiro: They may or may not be right for me
[16/11/2022, 00:21:02] Alice Lafferty: Pretty funny to watch that play out.
[16/11/2022, 00:21:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I find that tension kind of amusing too.
[16/11/2022, 00:22:03] Alex Regueiro: There's no doubt I hold socially conservative views to a good extent. (Though maybe not as much as you think?) You'll have to let me know if any of them bother you.
[16/11/2022, 00:22:08] Alex Regueiro: Although I think you hold some of the same ones
[16/11/2022, 00:22:46] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, it's actually pretty difficult for me to express the nuances in my opinions here...
[16/11/2022, 00:22:56] Alice Lafferty: I think you wrote quite compellingly about how meaningful it would be to have children, it seemed genuine.
[16/11/2022, 00:23:18] Alice Lafferty: Uh yes but I fail to live up to my own standards.
[16/11/2022, 00:23:20] Alex Regueiro: Well, I'm glad I did. It was 80% at an intellectual level though
[16/11/2022, 00:23:46] Alice Lafferty: I know, it's quite complicated.
[16/11/2022, 00:23:49] Alex Regueiro: Even at my age, I'm not exactly in a rush. (And I have the biological privilege in that respect of being a man!)
[16/11/2022, 00:24:39] Alex Regueiro: There are all sorts of things I think are excellent norms for society but I will probably never satisfy, through ability or desire!
[16/11/2022, 00:25:34] Alice Lafferty: I wonder to what extent your decision to have a family (if you do), flows from your political convictions rather than genuine desire?
[16/11/2022, 00:25:43] Alice Lafferty: I mean, this is what I often ask myself.
[16/11/2022, 00:25:48] Alex Regueiro: But now I'm not sure if you're just hedging and being admirably candid, or you'd prefer an excuse just to be friends?
[16/11/2022, 00:26:40] Alex Regueiro: I had literally zero personal desire until a few years ago. Now it's not a strong personal desire, but it's maybe at the back of my head as "something that needs to be resolved by the time I'm 40 or so".
[16/11/2022, 00:26:56] Alex Regueiro: And you're right, a large part stems from my political convictions.
[16/11/2022, 00:27:10] Alice Lafferty: Not really. It's not personal, I just wonder whether I'm fit to be in any relationship at all.
[16/11/2022, 00:27:29] Alice Lafferty: Right.
[16/11/2022, 00:27:52] Alex Regueiro: I should probably share my more liberal/progressive political views at some point too! Even if they're fewer haha.
[16/11/2022, 00:27:56] Alice Lafferty: I've kind of seen this in other men who have got caught up in the neo-traditional wave.
[16/11/2022, 00:28:24] Alex Regueiro: And they're kind of mainstream for the most part. Mainstream for my generation at least.
[16/11/2022, 00:28:46] Alex Regueiro: Ah right. Just other men generally, or ones interested in you?
[16/11/2022, 00:29:25] Alex Regueiro: I'm being totally honest when I say I'm not remotely looking for a "tradwife". I only learnt that term a couple of years or so ago, and found it amusing.
[16/11/2022, 00:29:34] Alex Regueiro: Okay
[16/11/2022, 00:30:11] Alice Lafferty: They kind of discuss abstractly the 'meaning' and 'value' of having a family, often very well, but it seems they have come to this decision in some way other than emotionally or experientially.
[16/11/2022, 00:30:33] Alice Lafferty: Like 'have children to own the libs', put crudely.
[16/11/2022, 00:30:56] Alice Lafferty: No just men online and a few I met at university.
[16/11/2022, 00:31:17] Alex Regueiro: Haha. The ugliest possible way to put it, but sadly that's probably the view of many
[16/11/2022, 00:31:19] Alice Lafferty: Or to 'get the white birth rate up' or something.
[16/11/2022, 00:31:39] Alex Regueiro: Who knew there were so many of this type at Camb!
[16/11/2022, 00:31:51] Alice Lafferty: Hmm you say that but you would probably enjoy it.
[16/11/2022, 00:32:10] Alex Regueiro: Ugh
[16/11/2022, 00:32:14] Alex Regueiro: You assume too much of me
[16/11/2022, 00:32:23] Alice Lafferty: I keep trying to tell people the right-wing backlash in those under 25 is real!
[16/11/2022, 00:32:37] Alex Regueiro: I'm literally just saying that traditional family values are socially beneficial for the most part!
[16/11/2022, 00:32:59] Alex Regueiro: Maybe I shared too much and over the wrong medium. üôÅ
[16/11/2022, 00:33:08] Alice Lafferty: Just as 'wokeism' fermented in universities, so is the next intellectual movement.
[16/11/2022, 00:33:46] Alice Lafferty: No, I completely understand what you mean.
[16/11/2022, 00:34:05] Alex Regueiro: It's all a journey for meaning. I don't know what mine will consist of yet. I may seem like I have my ideas clear, but I'm so undecided on many thanks.
[16/11/2022, 00:34:11] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I've really put you off, I can tell
[16/11/2022, 00:34:14] Alex Regueiro: That's a shame
[16/11/2022, 00:34:38] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I've definitely seen some evidence of it too, though haven't looked into it too much
[16/11/2022, 00:34:45] Alice Lafferty: Simply that these values you hold more generally influence the way you conduct your personal life (even subconsciously?)
[16/11/2022, 00:35:14] Alice Lafferty: * must influence your personal life
[16/11/2022, 00:35:36] Alex Regueiro: There's no doubt they influence my own life subconsciously. But only to an extent. I'm very comfortable with cognitive dissonance and even slight hypocrisy, I'll have you know! üôÉ
[16/11/2022, 00:37:27] Alice Lafferty: Not at all. It was more the process laying out fully my positions/details of my own life, made me realise how barren a philosophy it is.
[16/11/2022, 00:37:56] Alex Regueiro: Alright
[16/11/2022, 00:37:58] Alex Regueiro: Thank you
[16/11/2022, 00:38:46] Alice Lafferty: Haha, exactly. Everyone is. How many times has a family values politician been caught in some sex scandal? Too many to count.
[16/11/2022, 00:39:07] Alex Regueiro: Your forthrightness about these things is kind of charming. It's made me more forthright in return. Or rather, forthright at an earlier stage in getting to know someone!
[16/11/2022, 00:39:11] Alex Regueiro: But that probably can't hurt.
[16/11/2022, 00:39:51] Alex Regueiro: We'll still finding out how good a fit we are for each other and exactly how much we like each other, right? üôÇ
[16/11/2022, 00:40:28] Alex Regueiro: Hah yep! Or indeed views on lockdown. Or both, in the marvellous case of Mr. Hancock.
[16/11/2022, 00:40:34] Alice Lafferty: I don't really know what the done thing is. It could also just be that I don't really have anyone to discuss these things with, so I'll talk to the first person who listens!
[16/11/2022, 00:41:04] Alex Regueiro: It could well be that
[16/11/2022, 00:41:04] Alice Lafferty: Bad trait
[16/11/2022, 00:41:36] Alice Lafferty: He's having some sort of strung-out midlife crisis surely?
[16/11/2022, 00:42:19] Alex Regueiro: I'm inclined to take it as a positive sign though, all this sharing of philosophy and "info-dumping", if you will!
[16/11/2022, 00:43:08] Alex Regueiro: At least of friendship. üôÇ
[16/11/2022, 00:43:41] Alex Regueiro: Quite possibly, though I'm convinced a lot of current politicians are just stuck in adolescence.
[16/11/2022, 00:44:20] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[16/11/2022, 00:45:18] Alex Regueiro: I now know you'd tell me lf you found me an insufferable bore or simpleton, right? üòâ
[16/11/2022, 00:45:31] Alex Regueiro: I'm afraid I'd probably have to say the same...
[16/11/2022, 00:47:10] Alice Lafferty: My filter isn't that bad.. but I don't think you're any of those things. I think if anything we're too similar psychologically.
[16/11/2022, 00:47:36] Alice Lafferty: Hopefully you don't take that as an insult!
[16/11/2022, 00:47:50] Alex Regueiro: I was half-kidding hah
[16/11/2022, 00:48:02] Alex Regueiro: But you'd definitely drop hints at which I could pick up
[16/11/2022, 00:48:15] Alex Regueiro: We're definitely quite similar psychologically in some ways
[16/11/2022, 00:49:11] Alex Regueiro: "Too" similar... quite possibly, though I think it can work both ways. (You can tell I'm trying to be an optimist here, quite against my nature.)
[16/11/2022, 00:49:36] Alice Lafferty: Maybe, or maybe we're both faultily interpreting each other's social cues and have been talking past each other this whole time??
[16/11/2022, 00:51:13] Alex Regueiro: Hah, you never know
[16/11/2022, 00:51:49] Alex Regueiro: I'd like to think I have higher EQ than that though. Even though I admit much of my EQ is acquired and not innate!
[16/11/2022, 00:52:11] Alex Regueiro: On that cheery note, I shall bid you good night.
[16/11/2022, 00:52:58] Alice Lafferty: Yes the miscommunication, if there is any, is on my part.
[16/11/2022, 00:53:03] Alice Lafferty: Ok good night
[16/11/2022, 00:56:44] Alex Regueiro: Not that you asked, but I've known a lot of 'Aspies', and your communication skills get a favourable score on my scale. üôÇ
[16/11/2022, 00:56:59] Alex Regueiro: Talk about weekend plans tomorrow, if you like
[16/11/2022, 00:57:01] Alex Regueiro: Gute nacht
[16/11/2022, 17:49:43] Alice Lafferty: Sorry again for throwing myself a pity party yesterday evening. Will have to introduce a no-texting after 10pm rule because I become too intense.
[16/11/2022, 18:07:45] Alex Regueiro: Hey. Don't worry about it! I mean, yes it was a tad intense, but I think I'm used to intense people and intense conversations in my life...
[16/11/2022, 18:08:16] Alex Regueiro: And I hope this came off the right way... was meant to reassure you somewhat.
[16/11/2022, 18:08:20] Alex Regueiro: How's your day been?
[16/11/2022, 20:24:11] Alex Regueiro: Apparently today is dedicated to St Albert the Great, the patron saint of natural science. A friend posted that earlier. I hadn't even heard of him!
[16/11/2022, 20:24:18] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-ZmwHOUAlw
[16/11/2022, 20:26:04] Alex Regueiro: I think you might find Conformal Cyclic Cosmology really interesting. It's something Roger Penrose has been working on for the last decade or two, and among other things it could explain how entropy sort of "resets" as one universe dies and another is born, in a cyclical fashion. I don't pretend to understand the physics properly, but I had the privilege of attending a seminar by Penrose on this at Oxford, and another public lecture in London a few years ago.
[16/11/2022, 20:26:38] Alex Regueiro: The idea really fascinated me in any case. I wonder what Isaac Asimov would think!
[17/11/2022, 17:43:19] Alice Lafferty: Is this also called 'the big bounce' theory (lol)?
[17/11/2022, 17:43:46] Alice Lafferty: I'm watching the video.
[17/11/2022, 17:52:43] Alex Regueiro: üôÇ
[17/11/2022, 17:53:08] Alex Regueiro: Hah not quite. Everyone does remember that name though!
[17/11/2022, 17:53:16] Alex Regueiro: It's similar in that it's a cyclic universe
[17/11/2022, 17:53:52] Alex Regueiro: With the Big Bounce, the growth of the universe must be decelerating, and it eventually stops expanding and contracts into a "big crunch" and that repeats indefinitely
[17/11/2022, 17:54:00] Alex Regueiro: But we now know from lots of observation that can't happen
[17/11/2022, 17:54:20] Alice Lafferty: Thank you for showing me. Cosmology is the most interesting subject in physics imo.
[17/11/2022, 17:54:53] Alex Regueiro: This is more like, the universe expands and after an inordinate amount of time, it's so cold and dead that in some well-defined mathematical way (this is the "conformal" bit) it starts looking again like the early universe, but sort of rescaled, and now low entropy again
[17/11/2022, 17:55:25] Alex Regueiro: Glad you're interested. I always found it the same. (More so than astrophysics, though that can sometimes be good too.)
[17/11/2022, 17:55:34] Alice Lafferty: I see so spatially it does not 'reset' into a single point
[17/11/2022, 17:56:02] Alice Lafferty: I don't see where the energy will suddenly come from to trigger a 'second big bang' and restart the cycle?
[17/11/2022, 17:56:05] Alex Regueiro: It kind of does in the sense that our ordinary notions of spacetime (even those of general relativity) break down
[17/11/2022, 17:56:10] Alice Lafferty: But it's not surprising that I don't get it I suppose
[17/11/2022, 17:56:20] Alex Regueiro: and the whole physical scale sort of "resets"
[17/11/2022, 17:57:00] Alex Regueiro: The maths is beyond me at this point too, to be honest. But I have some vague notion of how it might work, through a "conformal mapping".
[17/11/2022, 17:57:14] Alex Regueiro: mathematical wizardry really, that's what theoretical physics is at some level...
[17/11/2022, 17:57:51] Alice Lafferty: Presumably at this stage there are no large objects, so gravitational fields are very diffuse?
[17/11/2022, 18:00:42] Alice Lafferty: Haha this guy did a lot of the scholastic work Aquinas is given credit for now.
[17/11/2022, 18:01:03] Alex Regueiro: Right, even the black holes have evaporated by then. So everything is incredibly boring!
[17/11/2022, 18:01:19] Alex Regueiro: Though as Penrose said, photons don't really get bored üòâ
[17/11/2022, 18:02:16] Alex Regueiro: Hah, maybe that's a good thing though, given how dull Aquinas is, you say? I did read Aquinas was his student, but not that.
‚Äé[17/11/2022, 18:04:15] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[17/11/2022, 18:05:44] Alice Lafferty: This is funny because he sort of gives a layout of his cosmological positions in the Emperor's New Mind.
[17/11/2022, 18:06:05] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I've seen that, though I'm not sure it illustrates what's going on here perfectly. The core idea is just that  angles/directions and relative orientations are preserved by a conformal mapping, but lengths are lost
[17/11/2022, 18:06:09] Alice Lafferty: I literally just included this to try and understand a bit better myself, obviously you already know
[17/11/2022, 18:06:27] Alex Regueiro: The notion of length is sort of lost in the very late universe
[17/11/2022, 18:06:40] Alice Lafferty: :s how can a triangle be preserved with the same angles but different lengths.
[17/11/2022, 18:07:05] Alice Lafferty: Wouldn't that make it no longer a triangle.
[17/11/2022, 18:07:18] Alex Regueiro: Oh, you've already started reading it, super üôÇ
[17/11/2022, 18:07:33] Alex Regueiro: I think it was written in the 90s? Not sure if he'd started developing CCC by then
[17/11/2022, 18:07:36] Alice Lafferty: I sort of get that physical objects cause spacetime to warp. But
[17/11/2022, 18:07:54] Alex Regueiro: In the platonic world of pure mathematics, you basically just "throw away" some of the structure!
[17/11/2022, 18:08:21] Alice Lafferty: it seems like at the end of this universe cycle all mass would have decayed hence there would be no gravitational fields/'warping' whatsoever?
[17/11/2022, 18:08:22] Alex Regueiro: When you deal with such foundational matters in physics you really have to fight back against your worldly intuition in so many ways
[17/11/2022, 18:09:17] Alex Regueiro: Mass-energy is still confused, it's just all the energy is in the form of photons and other non-interacting elementary particles, rather than actual matter
[17/11/2022, 18:09:25] Alex Regueiro: But photons still exert gravitational influence
[17/11/2022, 18:09:29] Alice Lafferty: Yes... honestly I found the quantum brain idea kind of kooky.
[17/11/2022, 18:10:19] Alex Regueiro: It really is
[17/11/2022, 18:10:20] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes I didn't understand what he meant by 'photons do not experience time'.
[17/11/2022, 18:10:36] Alex Regueiro: If he weren't a genius physicist with an impressive career behind him, people would have written him off as a crank
[17/11/2022, 18:10:48] Alex Regueiro: It's a consequence of special relativity, something called "time dilation"
[17/11/2022, 18:11:22] Alex Regueiro: Basically, the closer you get to the speed of light (the speed limit of the universe, more accurately put), the more everything slows down from your frame of reference
[17/11/2022, 18:13:16] Alex Regueiro: I know, this is all a bit mind-bending without a gentler introduction! It is to everyone really.
[17/11/2022, 18:13:31] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. I think I learnt this stuff at school even, sorry.
[17/11/2022, 18:14:19] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, you wouldn't unless you did physics or maybe maths at uni. Don't worry at all. I just thought you might be intrigued by how entropy sort of "resets" under this conformal mapping in Penrose's theory. üôÇ
[17/11/2022, 18:14:23] Alex Regueiro: it's quite elegant in a way
[17/11/2022, 18:16:49] Alex Regueiro: Before I head off to dinner, just wanted to say I read a couple of the Larkin poems and really enjoyed them. Especially An Arundel Tomb, probably because of my fondness for all things historical/medieval. Old church monuments can be enchanting. One of the few nice things about Facebook is I get the odd post/photo on my feed from the Church Monuments group I subscribe to haha.
[17/11/2022, 18:17:05] Alex Regueiro: The last stanza I might have seen before even.
[17/11/2022, 18:17:55] Alex Regueiro: Love Songs In Age was great too. Both wistful and brutally realist in one. He combines those two feelings expertly, I thought.
[17/11/2022, 18:18:10] Alex Regueiro: I have to read Aubade still.
[17/11/2022, 22:30:57] Alex Regueiro: I suppose it's passed your self-imposed curfew now, but let me know if you're still up for something on Saturday. Maybe I can phone you tomorrow if that makes it easier to plan? Good night!
[17/11/2022, 23:50:48] Alice Lafferty: Huh, I still don't understand, if entropy is a measure of the number of possible microstates, how the end state of the universe (high entropy) is mathematically similar to to the early universe (low entropy).
[17/11/2022, 23:54:09] Alice Lafferty: He does suggest something like... everything will decay into photons and if photons don't 'experience' time, they are basically emitted at the same time they are absorbed (from their frame of reference). So all photons are everywhere at the same time. Which means the energy density of a late-stage universe containing only photons technically has infinite energy density, and could lead to a big bang?
[17/11/2022, 23:55:23] Alice Lafferty: I think I'm suck on the idea of the big bang being very compressed spatially, therefore having a very low number of possible microstates.
[17/11/2022, 23:55:35] Alice Lafferty: :(
[17/11/2022, 23:55:54] Alice Lafferty: It was nice of you to read them. I'm glad you liked them.
[17/11/2022, 23:56:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, this is far from obvious.
[17/11/2022, 23:56:44] Alex Regueiro: I had to look it up...
[17/11/2022, 23:56:59] Alex Regueiro: "Penrose associates the initial low entropy content of the universe or the past hypothesis with the effective vanishing of the Weyl curvature tensor of the cosmological gravitational field near the Big Bang. From then on, he proposes, its dynamical influence gradually increased, thus being responsible for an overall increase in the amount of entropy in the universe, and so inducing a cosmological arrow of time."
[17/11/2022, 23:57:21] Alex Regueiro: That's beyond me too, I'm afraid
[17/11/2022, 23:57:46] Alice Lafferty: Re Saturday I don't mind coming up to sort of Essex area, if you can suggest somewhere? It will be no problem because I may be in Chigwell anyway to see a church.
[17/11/2022, 23:58:19] Alex Regueiro: I don't think the spatial volume has much to do with it, though you're right that in some sense there weren't many degrees of freedom in this initial state.
[17/11/2022, 23:58:19] Alice Lafferty: I don't know what the Weyl curvature tensor is.
[17/11/2022, 23:59:03] Alex Regueiro: That makes two of us.
[17/11/2022, 23:59:37] Alex Regueiro: Well, it's a mathematical structure that has something to do with general relativity!
[18/11/2022, 00:00:39] Alex Regueiro: (Remember, space-time itself is what expands. The metric.)
[18/11/2022, 00:00:50] Alice Lafferty: So it's not even something covered at undergrad?
[18/11/2022, 00:01:24] Alice Lafferty: :s
[18/11/2022, 00:03:47] Alex Regueiro: I did. Hopefully I'm not too far off the mark... I'm not sure exactly how jaded/cynical Larkin is about romance, but it still beats soppy romance. Looking forward to reading the other one too.
[18/11/2022, 00:04:21] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, GR is sometimes covered in 4th year as an option, but I only did 3 and returned to physics much later. I have a fat book on GR sitting here, which I plan to ingest at some point!
[18/11/2022, 00:04:44] Alice Lafferty: Very, very jaded. Born out in his poetry and personal life.
[18/11/2022, 00:05:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh really? Is there a particularly nice one there?
[18/11/2022, 00:06:12] Alex Regueiro: If you like walks in the wood, that might be fun. We could see something moderately interesting like Loughton Camp, or just walk around High Beech... Get a late lunch at a pub maybe? I'm free at dinnertime on Saturday too though, so not too bothered.
[18/11/2022, 00:06:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah my estimate was anywhere from a 7 to a 10. Closer to a 10 then.
[18/11/2022, 00:07:11] Alice Lafferty: St Mary's Chigwell. It's quite nice, 12th century. I want to take a brass rubbing there though, mainly.
[18/11/2022, 00:07:36] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I've never been to either of these!
[18/11/2022, 00:08:10] Alice Lafferty: They both sound nice?
[18/11/2022, 00:09:24] Alex Regueiro: That's cool. If you want to even go to that Church together, I'd be happy to... but you probably have plans for that already, so I wouldn't want to make a mess of those.
[18/11/2022, 00:09:35] Alex Regueiro: There's a really nice church in High Beech too. It's where the local music society puts on concerts sometimes (my dad plays).
[18/11/2022, 00:10:31] Alice Lafferty: I was just going to go by myself, but didn't want to drag you into it.
[18/11/2022, 00:10:45] Alice Lafferty: It might be quite boring.
[18/11/2022, 00:10:48] Alex Regueiro: Loughton Camp is mainly just earthworks from a pre-Roman (Celtic) fort, but it's famous for a few things. I haven't been in a long long time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughton_Camp
[18/11/2022, 00:11:17] Alex Regueiro: Okay. If it has a nice monument, I'm down for it though. üòâ
[18/11/2022, 00:11:35] Alex Regueiro: Either way
[18/11/2022, 00:11:44] Alex Regueiro: It's really close to Loughton / High Beech.
[18/11/2022, 00:11:47] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I like churches. I'm not difficult to please there. But aware that it's not super exciting for most.
[18/11/2022, 00:12:26] Alice Lafferty: Haha Dick Turpin territory
[18/11/2022, 00:12:31] Alex Regueiro: Yep hah
[18/11/2022, 00:12:55] Alex Regueiro: And Boudica, and maybe Julius Caesar... what more drama can you want for a mound of dirt?!
[18/11/2022, 00:13:20] Alice Lafferty: Do you know if these places are all in walking distance from each other?
[18/11/2022, 00:14:22] Alice Lafferty: Also I might not be up and out properly until the afternoon. Maybe 3ish.
[18/11/2022, 00:14:27] Alex Regueiro: Churches can be incredibly atmospheric and otherworldly. And I don't even mean in a Christian sense. Plus the architecture and design is sometimes fun. I'm no expert like you though.
[18/11/2022, 00:14:35] Alice Lafferty: Hopefully not a problem although it gets dark so early.
[18/11/2022, 00:14:56] Alex Regueiro: Saw a bunch in Lincolnshire (and one in north Cambridgeshire) when I want on a short trip in the summer.
[18/11/2022, 00:15:08] Alex Regueiro: Some really impressive ones
[18/11/2022, 00:15:40] Alex Regueiro: It does, but I'm a half-vampire it seems, so it doesn't bother me much...
[18/11/2022, 00:15:45] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, Lincoln or Ely Cathedrals? Or parish churches?
[18/11/2022, 00:16:32] Alice Lafferty: Not an expert, really have an amateur interest in it. But I've been making brass rubbings for a while now. They're kind of fun to do?
[18/11/2022, 00:16:36] Alex Regueiro: Lincoln Cathedral which was magnificent, but also a few parish churches on the way there and back. (My English side came mainly from Lincolnshire so that was the draw to these towns and villages...)
[18/11/2022, 00:16:38] Alice Lafferty: Same.
[18/11/2022, 00:17:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh nice.
[18/11/2022, 00:17:42] Alex Regueiro: Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire (the ruins became a parish church) has an exceedingly interesting back story.
[18/11/2022, 00:17:55] Alice Lafferty: I believe my mother's English (maternal) side came from Gloucestershire mainly.
[18/11/2022, 00:18:50] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I ever got to go there... it wasn't even too far from me.
[18/11/2022, 00:19:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's not. Just by Peterborough.
[18/11/2022, 00:19:25] Alice Lafferty: You visited?
[18/11/2022, 00:19:29] Alex Regueiro: Ah nice. That's Bristol's historic county I think? Otherwise I don't know it well
[18/11/2022, 00:20:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Got a tour of the museum there and then walked around the abbey church and graveyard. Thorney is where my Huguenot (Walloon Calvinist) ancestors settled early on. Had their own French-speaking congregation there.
[18/11/2022, 00:21:00] Alice Lafferty: Do you know the pubs in that area too, by the way?
[18/11/2022, 00:21:01] Alex Regueiro: Strong association with the Dukes of Bedford (Russell family) there, and the fen drainage projects
[18/11/2022, 00:21:25] Alice Lafferty: I really don't know... is Bristol more Wilts/Somerset?
[18/11/2022, 00:21:42] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I'll stop boring you with that! It's really interesting to me with the personal connection though
[18/11/2022, 00:21:52] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. Just looked it up: apparently on the Gloucestershire/Somerset border
[18/11/2022, 00:21:58] Alex Regueiro: I know a few yeah
[18/11/2022, 00:22:00] Alice Lafferty: Very nice. I didn't know you'd traced so far back!
[18/11/2022, 00:22:23] Alice Lafferty: It's not boring at all.
[18/11/2022, 00:22:47] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, some lines go back to the Middle Ages but they're extremely few. 1600s is generally a real achievement in England. In Ireland, you're very lucky to get beyond 1800!
[18/11/2022, 00:22:58] Alice Lafferty: The Walloons were Belgian? üßê
[18/11/2022, 00:23:22] Alex Regueiro: Alright, so let's do a walk in that area (maybe Loughton camp) and then get dinner at some pub once the sun sets? üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 00:23:28] Alex Regueiro: I'll look up a route and pub... now even
[18/11/2022, 00:23:45] Alex Regueiro: Yep basically. I think they came from right around the modern border between Belgium/France.
[18/11/2022, 00:24:11] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[18/11/2022, 00:24:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh it's like a 13 minute walk from Loughton Camp to St Mary's.
[18/11/2022, 00:25:12] Alice Lafferty: Which, by the way, I can still go and do by myself if we run out of daylight.
[18/11/2022, 00:25:40] Alice Lafferty: Or equally I could just get a grip and we could meet a bit earlier
[18/11/2022, 00:26:10] Alex Regueiro: Wait that doesn't make sense... you must have gotten the wrong St Mary's?
[18/11/2022, 00:26:46] Alice Lafferty: üò≥ 13 minutes by car
[18/11/2022, 00:26:50] Alex Regueiro: I get how precious sleep is, so if your schedule is especially nocturnal right now, don't worry... 3:00 can work!
[18/11/2022, 00:26:51] Alice Lafferty: 1 hour's walk!
[18/11/2022, 00:26:55] Alice Lafferty: Sorry
[18/11/2022, 00:26:57] Alex Regueiro: Oh hah
[18/11/2022, 00:27:03] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that sounds about right
[18/11/2022, 00:27:05] Alice Lafferty: Completely misread that.
[18/11/2022, 00:27:26] Alex Regueiro: How would you be getting to St Mary's anyway, a taxi?
[18/11/2022, 00:28:12] Alice Lafferty: My mum may be going to Braintree on Saturday and can sort of drop me off on the way, or yes, just a cab
[18/11/2022, 00:28:27] Alice Lafferty: It's not a problem, I can do that another day.
[18/11/2022, 00:28:36] Alex Regueiro: Okay. üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 00:28:40] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good
[18/11/2022, 00:29:02] Alex Regueiro: This is the church I was talking about by the way. https://goo.gl/maps/KEzyE42jyMi1AYMFA
[18/11/2022, 00:29:07] Alex Regueiro: Not that we should see it, just wanted to mention it
[18/11/2022, 00:30:03] Alice Lafferty: Oh it looks very pretty. Not medieval though?
[18/11/2022, 00:30:33] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. Part of it might be, but the interior looks much more modern. Let me see...
[18/11/2022, 00:30:46] Alex Regueiro: Very Victorian interior
[18/11/2022, 00:31:02] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, seems it all dates from then?
[18/11/2022, 00:31:05] Alice Lafferty: I'd be happy to go and look around, if it's sort of en route and you don't mind!
[18/11/2022, 00:31:50] Alex Regueiro: Oh, so Loughton Camp is pretty close to this old pub that got converted into a decent Thai restaurant some years back. I've been there many times. Does that appeal?
[18/11/2022, 00:32:41] Alice Lafferty: You can tell its Victorian restoration and not medieval from the windows!
[18/11/2022, 00:32:43] Alex Regueiro: That works well with me. We can see where the walk takes us and improvise!
[18/11/2022, 00:33:13] Alice Lafferty: Ok, that sounds nice. We don't have to get dinner even, if it'd be too early. I'm quite relaxed.
[18/11/2022, 00:33:45] Alex Regueiro: Sure. I mean, my eating schedule isn't much more normal than yours so... let's just see how we feel then?
[18/11/2022, 00:34:04] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[18/11/2022, 00:34:24] Alice Lafferty: Where are we meeting then?
[18/11/2022, 00:36:45] Alice Lafferty: It's lucky you are not accompanying me brass rubbings as I would have bored you to death.
[18/11/2022, 00:36:56] Alex Regueiro: If we get lost and stranded in the forest, there's always plenty of rabbits knocking about that could make a good rustic dinner over a campfire!
[18/11/2022, 00:37:15] Alex Regueiro: üò¨
[18/11/2022, 00:37:32] Alice Lafferty: Haha, go completely feral in Epping Forest.
[18/11/2022, 00:37:34] Alex Regueiro: I'm actually slightly curious. So I don't mind either way really
[18/11/2022, 00:37:51] Alex Regueiro: If Dick Turpin could do it...
[18/11/2022, 00:38:26] Alex Regueiro: That actually reminds me of a tragicomic story about an old schoolmate of mine from a few years ago.
[18/11/2022, 00:38:44] Alice Lafferty: ??
[18/11/2022, 00:38:49] Alex Regueiro: Right, sorry... 3? Does that work for you?
[18/11/2022, 00:38:57] Alex Regueiro: Going feral in Epping Forest. Yep.
[18/11/2022, 00:39:25] Alice Lafferty: Can you give me co-ordinates of '3'
[18/11/2022, 00:39:47] Alex Regueiro: Since lunchtime looks out of the question in any case, there's no point hurrying.
[18/11/2022, 00:39:51] Alex Regueiro: Oh man, haha...
[18/11/2022, 00:39:55] Alex Regueiro: Totally misread that
[18/11/2022, 00:40:05] Alex Regueiro: Will you be coming from St Marys?
[18/11/2022, 00:40:43] Alice Lafferty: I feel like this would be impossible. Wouldn't you get stumbled upon by a nice middle-aged couple with a labrador.
[18/11/2022, 00:41:09] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's impossible in the 21st C.
[18/11/2022, 00:41:18] Alice Lafferty: Probably not.
[18/11/2022, 00:41:18] Alex Regueiro: Something like that would "save" you.
[18/11/2022, 00:41:36] Alex Regueiro: I've always wanted to do a Thoreau, but seems like it won't happen here. üôÅ
[18/11/2022, 00:42:31] Alice Lafferty: Same, it's so romantic. Maybe if you went off path in the Scottish highlands?
[18/11/2022, 00:42:37] Alice Lafferty: Or the Brecon Beacons or something?
[18/11/2022, 00:43:31] Alice Lafferty: You need an untraversable great expanse of land like Alaska, really.
[18/11/2022, 00:43:32] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that would probably work. One of the few areas of proper wilderness left in the country.
[18/11/2022, 00:44:06] Alex Regueiro: Ted Kaczynski is still alive, right? Could ask him for some tips
[18/11/2022, 00:44:47] Alice Lafferty: I actually wrote to him in prison when I was 14.
[18/11/2022, 00:44:54] Alice Lafferty: I believe my letter was intercepted.
[18/11/2022, 00:45:01] Alex Regueiro: Wow
[18/11/2022, 00:45:20] Alice Lafferty: Since he's known to be quite good with responses.
[18/11/2022, 00:45:29] Alex Regueiro: I'm so intrigued. What did you write?
[18/11/2022, 00:45:37] Alex Regueiro: Pesky FBI agent?
[18/11/2022, 00:46:16] Alice Lafferty: Oh some utter drivel about Brexit & Trump (this was 2016, and as if he cared??)
[18/11/2022, 00:46:55] Alice Lafferty: That or he had better things to do than respond to letters from children. But the first option is more glamorous.
[18/11/2022, 00:47:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I choose to believe that too
[18/11/2022, 00:47:15] Alice Lafferty: It was just very characteristically obnoxious of me.
[18/11/2022, 00:47:30] Alex Regueiro: https://goo.gl/maps/UDZKx4hgJm3ePNhy8 Does that look okay to you?
[18/11/2022, 00:47:33] Alice Lafferty: * or maybe arrogant is the better word.
[18/11/2022, 00:48:13] Alice Lafferty: Yes that looks fine.
[18/11/2022, 00:48:34] Alex Regueiro: Hah, I bet it's a good read regardless. Don't worry, I won't pressure you... but some day maybe üòâ
[18/11/2022, 00:49:04] Alex Regueiro: Great. It's like a 20 minute walk to Loughton Camp from there. Even less.
[18/11/2022, 00:49:05] Alice Lafferty: I no longer have the letter, and I did not make any copies!
[18/11/2022, 00:49:38] Alex Regueiro: Okay, then I'll just have to get you drunk enough for you to tell me about it
[18/11/2022, 00:49:45] Alex Regueiro: Presume you read his manifesto?
[18/11/2022, 00:49:48] Alice Lafferty: I kind of regret that now.
[18/11/2022, 00:50:00] Alex Regueiro: (before sending it)
[18/11/2022, 00:50:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes. I was very into anarcho-primitivism in my early teens.
[18/11/2022, 00:50:31] Alice Lafferty: Because it was #edgy
[18/11/2022, 00:50:42] Alex Regueiro: We'd have plenty of time to wander somewhere else afterwards... wherever takes our fancy.
[18/11/2022, 00:51:05] Alice Lafferty: Loughton Camp doesn't have its own car park?
[18/11/2022, 00:51:18] Alice Lafferty: Is this all walkable from you?
[18/11/2022, 00:51:26] Alice Lafferty: I just forgot you're not driving.
[18/11/2022, 00:52:27] Alex Regueiro: But it's such a better form of edginess that the usual crap like being an emo/goth!
[18/11/2022, 00:53:10] Alex Regueiro: Alas not. It's pretty much in the middle of the trees I think. And yes, that car park is just a 10/15 minute walk from home. I'm being very selfish really.
[18/11/2022, 00:53:29] Alice Lafferty: Maybe. Although I did a bit of that as well though!
[18/11/2022, 00:53:44] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[18/11/2022, 00:53:47] Alice Lafferty: Not at all!
[18/11/2022, 00:54:02] Alex Regueiro: Now I want to see pictures of how you used to dress. üòÑ
[18/11/2022, 00:54:17] Alex Regueiro: I was such a boring teenager in most ways. At least until I hit 16/17
[18/11/2022, 00:54:22] Alice Lafferty: I offered to come up to you. Besides there seems to be a bit more to do than there is in N London.
[18/11/2022, 00:54:49] Alex Regueiro: Perfect. 3:00pm there. It's in my diary.
[18/11/2022, 00:55:39] Alice Lafferty: I was too repressed and shy to really join any kind of 'scene'. I just listened to My Chemical Romance lonelily  in my bedroom :(
[18/11/2022, 00:55:41] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I appreciate that. I honestly don't mind going to your London microcosm though. I'm sure it's nice still.
[18/11/2022, 00:55:57] Alex Regueiro: didn't*
[18/11/2022, 00:56:04] Alice Lafferty: Me too. I never really went through a good healthy 'rebellious' phase.
[18/11/2022, 00:56:22] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps next time, if you can bear to see me again after this occasion!
[18/11/2022, 00:56:47] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, I wonder how important it is to a 'normal' maturation process. Might explain a lot with me.
[18/11/2022, 00:57:22] Alice Lafferty: There's some nice parks, one the grounds of an old house which is now a psychiatric hospital. And another Tudor house which is fire-damaged :)
[18/11/2022, 00:57:25] Alice Lafferty: So not much.
[18/11/2022, 00:57:53] Alice Lafferty: I think you seem fairly well-adjusted!
[18/11/2022, 00:58:27] Alex Regueiro: (I'm always messing up these emojis)
[18/11/2022, 00:58:45] Alex Regueiro: Thanks. Perhaps I am, though I'll admit it took me a long time in an ycase!
[18/11/2022, 00:59:35] Alex Regueiro: Now we just have to wait for the psychiatric hospital to be abandoned and that will make for a really fun trespassing experience... and maybe a found-footage film.
[18/11/2022, 00:59:54] Alice Lafferty: Then again, if you go a little further south eg. Hampstead, there's plenty to do there. You might already be familiar with that area?
[18/11/2022, 01:00:11] Alice Lafferty: Didn't notice?
[18/11/2022, 01:00:30] Alex Regueiro: I mean in general, I click the wrong one. Not necessarily with you. Never mind!
[18/11/2022, 01:00:46] Alice Lafferty: Haha exactly. There are actually really cool forums where people share abandoned buildings and their access points...
[18/11/2022, 01:00:51] Alice Lafferty: I've never been to one though.
[18/11/2022, 01:01:00] Alex Regueiro: A little, but not extremely. There are some great things to do there anyway... so something to keep in mind at least!
[18/11/2022, 01:01:42] Alice Lafferty: Not really easy to get to on the central line either.
[18/11/2022, 01:01:49] Alex Regueiro: Fascinating. You ever had an adventure like that?
[18/11/2022, 01:02:17] Alex Regueiro: That's the pain. But the best way is probably train from Stratford. Much more pleasant too.
[18/11/2022, 01:02:19] Alice Lafferty: No! I would love to though.
[18/11/2022, 01:02:22] Alice Lafferty: Have you?
[18/11/2022, 01:02:39] Alice Lafferty: Hampstead Heath station is definitely on the overground.
[18/11/2022, 01:03:08] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I did that a few times and wasn't too bad.
[18/11/2022, 01:03:27] Alex Regueiro: I could show you the harpsichords there, at least....
[18/11/2022, 01:03:35] Alice Lafferty: You mean at Kenwood?
[18/11/2022, 01:03:37] Alex Regueiro: Nope, but same... would be really fun
[18/11/2022, 01:03:46] Alex Regueiro: Yep. You've already seen them?
[18/11/2022, 01:03:57] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, we talked about this, but I can't remember what exactly you said
[18/11/2022, 01:04:01] Alice Lafferty: I truly truly love it there, but no I was not even aware there were harpsichords..
[18/11/2022, 01:04:09] Alex Regueiro: Yes, you did say that!
[18/11/2022, 01:04:14] Alice Lafferty: Yes it came as a surprise to me.
[18/11/2022, 01:04:19] Alex Regueiro: Okay, then there's a good excuse to return. üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 01:04:48] Alice Lafferty: Might be kind of nice and frosty.
[18/11/2022, 01:05:43] Alice Lafferty: Snow is forecast at some point in the next couple of weeks apparently...? Although having looked again they seem to have dialled that prediction back a bit :(
[18/11/2022, 01:06:28] Alex Regueiro: On Saturday? I think it's meant to be sunny and a bit nippy.
[18/11/2022, 01:06:55] Alice Lafferty: No I mean in London over the next few weeks.
[18/11/2022, 01:07:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh boo. Well if it comes around Christmas, I won't complain... I remember literally one White Christmas at home.
[18/11/2022, 01:07:03] Alex Regueiro: oh right
[18/11/2022, 01:07:51] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I remember a single one.. England sometimes coughs up a pathetic bit of snow in like March.
[18/11/2022, 01:08:01] Alice Lafferty: But then I am never in England at Christmas so
[18/11/2022, 01:08:12] Alice Lafferty: Do you remember what year that was?
[18/11/2022, 01:08:20] Alex Regueiro: Of course, the price to pay for one or two days of a beautiful white landscape is the horrid slush for the next 3 or 4...
[18/11/2022, 01:08:42] Alice Lafferty: Yes true
[18/11/2022, 01:08:45] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, I really don't. Maybe in my teens?
[18/11/2022, 01:09:01] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it came in April once or twice even. Ghastly.
[18/11/2022, 01:09:05] Alice Lafferty: I will not embarrass you by trying to guess how old I was...
[18/11/2022, 01:09:07] Alex Regueiro: Where are you usually?
[18/11/2022, 01:09:49] Alice Lafferty: *sorry I hope you're not actually insecure about your age. Because there's no reason for you to be
[18/11/2022, 01:09:59] Alex Regueiro: Google says last one was 99... it must have been a White Boxing Day!
[18/11/2022, 01:10:15] Alex Regueiro: I'm not really, though I'll often joke about it with younger or older people.
[18/11/2022, 01:10:33] Alice Lafferty: French Alps! So several feet of beautiful pristine snow usually.
[18/11/2022, 01:10:55] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[18/11/2022, 01:11:08] Alex Regueiro: Still, I won't guess or even imagine your age then, since it will make me feel like a cradle snatcher at best!
[18/11/2022, 01:11:27] Alice Lafferty: Even I've started to get grouchy about 'kids'. It's quite fun.
[18/11/2022, 01:11:52] Alex Regueiro: Lovely. I've never been, though I went skiing in Austria and Italy a few times as a kid. You ski then, I take it?
[18/11/2022, 01:12:28] Alice Lafferty: I don't really tend to notice age gaps. If anything I often get on best with like the genuinely elderly.
[18/11/2022, 01:12:45] Alice Lafferty: I do
[18/11/2022, 01:13:09] Alex Regueiro: Definitely. There's something incredibly satisfying (albeit self-indulgent) about being a curmudgeon and grouching about the whipeprsnappers!
[18/11/2022, 01:13:45] Alice Lafferty: To be fair ski resorts tend to do Christmas extremely well.
[18/11/2022, 01:13:47] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I'm not really... but I will take almost any opportunity to mock Zoomers.
[18/11/2022, 01:14:58] Alice Lafferty: I think Zoomers have the upper hand in terms of pushing millenials out of culture-making positions.
[18/11/2022, 01:15:10] Alex Regueiro: I've found that too. It never bothered me whatsoever at the time, though looking back I sometimes see how odd it is in some sense. These days my friends range from early 20s to maybe early 50s. And that's not counting family friends.
[18/11/2022, 01:15:39] Alice Lafferty: I think that's a really good thing.
[18/11/2022, 01:15:43] Alex Regueiro: To be fair we suck as a generation. Though we also have the privilege of knowing a time before the Internet and the smartphone.
[18/11/2022, 01:16:09] Alice Lafferty: Intergenerational bonds are good. It's not exactly 'natural' to only interact with people your own age.
[18/11/2022, 01:16:30] Alice Lafferty: But I wouldn't even know how to initiate or maintain a friendship with someone in their fifties.
[18/11/2022, 01:16:43] Alex Regueiro: We also have "less bad" humour, I'd say. On the other hand, the politics of Zoomers is really interesting. I think the woke ones are even more woke than us Millennials, but there's also a lot more waking up and reacting against it (including but not only neo-conservatives)
[18/11/2022, 01:16:54] Alice Lafferty: I guess I'd think, 'on what basis would they want to talk to me?'
[18/11/2022, 01:17:40] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly. The political landscape is tending towards more extreme bipolarity.
[18/11/2022, 01:17:41] Alex Regueiro: It's a bit too big of a gap for you maybe. For me just about doable. I'm thinking of a French friend I met at Oxford, who was maybe 38/39 then... so 48/49 now. I revise my upper bound.
[18/11/2022, 01:17:55] Alice Lafferty: I can personally attest to the surprising social conservativeness of a lot of young people.
[18/11/2022, 01:18:53] Alex Regueiro: Which makes it both more exciting and more worrying. People change a lot as they grow up, including politically, but if Zoomers somehow started leading our societies tomorrow, we'd frankly be screwed.
[18/11/2022, 01:19:00] Alice Lafferty: I don't think millennials 'suck'. I think there were a lot of quite good impulses there. Pl
[18/11/2022, 01:19:19] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I tend to agree.
[18/11/2022, 01:19:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I was initially surprised, but not any more. It's pretty interesting finding out how they see the world.
[18/11/2022, 01:19:50] Alex Regueiro: Case in point with you!
[18/11/2022, 01:19:59] Alex Regueiro: Pl?
[18/11/2022, 01:20:31] Alice Lafferty: To be honest, as much as 'progressives' irritate and exasperate me, I would take them everyday over say a US or MENA style theocracy.
[18/11/2022, 01:20:46] Alice Lafferty: I think that was just a typo, sorry.
[18/11/2022, 01:20:47] Alex Regueiro: It isn't. Age difference of friends to oneself is probably normally distributed. Or should be at least.
[18/11/2022, 01:21:33] Alex Regueiro: I guess it always came naturally to me because I was more 'serious' than most of my peers growing up. I broke out of my shell eventually, but even then...
[18/11/2022, 01:21:45] Alex Regueiro: I'm still ahead of my years in many respect and behind in many others.
[18/11/2022, 01:22:27] Alice Lafferty: Probably right. It's pretty interesting though that older generation you would expect to go to for wisdom or prudence or whatever (boomers) are pretty much just liberals.
[18/11/2022, 01:22:29] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, screw that. US is weird because it's been very bipolar for some time now
[18/11/2022, 01:22:43] Alex Regueiro: Bible Belt vs the hyper liberal-progressive urban coasts
[18/11/2022, 01:23:32] Alice Lafferty: Haha same!
[18/11/2022, 01:24:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, Boomers kind of ruined a lot of things. I've read some theories about it (the basics at least). But they're still more grounded in other ways than Millennials or Zoomers. I suppose I have a natural connection with Boomers because they're my parents and all my aunts/uncles. And all my grandparents were from the G.I. aka 'Greatest' generation
[18/11/2022, 01:24:21] Alice Lafferty: Right. It's fortunate for us we do not have a religious right.
[18/11/2022, 01:24:52] Alex Regueiro: Apparently the whole Baby Boomer generation isn't really valid in the UK in terms of demographics though! I just learnt that recently. Quite surprising. It doesn't stand out if you look at the charts, unlike the US.
[18/11/2022, 01:24:58] Alice Lafferty: My parents are technically cusp Gen X/boomer but spiritually, they are absolutely boomers.
[18/11/2022, 01:25:09] Alex Regueiro: Yep. The US is pretty much unique amongst highly developed nations in that regard.
[18/11/2022, 01:25:31] Alex Regueiro: The common-sensical reasonable centre in the US is tragically small these days though. üôÅ
[18/11/2022, 01:26:14] Alice Lafferty: Are any of the generations actually based in demography? Only very loosely. They seem to be more like useful constructs to talk about different modes of thinking/progressive change through time.
[18/11/2022, 01:26:30] Alice Lafferty: Like, the vast vast majority of boomers were not actually hippies.
[18/11/2022, 01:26:32] Alex Regueiro: And in the nicest possible way (empathy even), I can vouch for it. Perhaps it's part of what drew me to you, despite your age.
[18/11/2022, 01:27:38] Alex Regueiro: Most of it is shifts in ethos/zeitgeist, but I think the Baby Boomer generation was also meant to be based in large part on a post-War boom in childbirth, no?
[18/11/2022, 01:28:25] Alex Regueiro: Yep. My dad certainly wasn't, even though he went through a (slightly) rebellious stage. My mum not at all. But they both have elder sisters who were hippies. 1/6 and 1/3 respectively.
[18/11/2022, 01:28:37] Alice Lafferty: You know under a modern ethical framework of power relations & harm reductionism, you could be accused of 'taking advantage of me'.
[18/11/2022, 01:29:10] Alice Lafferty: But maybe you could plead 'not psychologically/socially mature yourself' or something.
[18/11/2022, 01:29:35] Alice Lafferty: Can you elaborate? I'm a bit socially stunted you mean?
[18/11/2022, 01:29:39] Alex Regueiro: I know. As if I needed another reason not to subscribe critical theory and its thousands subfields!
[18/11/2022, 01:30:53] Alice Lafferty: My mum was a bit too young to be a proper hippie, but she's extremely liberal towards sex & pornography. Also more subtly stuff like work ethic, hedonism...
[18/11/2022, 01:31:48] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I should have been clearer. I mean a few things... your outlook on the world, knowledge and learning, and other things are well ahead of your years! And in the things you might be behind on, you remind me a good deal of myself at that age... heck, even now a bit.
[18/11/2022, 01:31:55] Alice Lafferty: I want to put it succinctly and say the boomer lib mindset is something like 'you don't owe anybody anything'. Something like that. Even if it comes in different strengths.
[18/11/2022, 01:32:23] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I won't press you any further!
[18/11/2022, 01:32:38] Alice Lafferty: Or 'let people enjoy things'.
[18/11/2022, 01:33:53] Alex Regueiro: I mean, you're so far from the average undergrad who just wants to party, get drunk, have casual sex, travel the corners of the world, and be a good little consumer...
[18/11/2022, 01:34:38] Alex Regueiro: I hope you didn't take it negatively, because it was meant as a compliment, if anything. Or at least a sort of affinity hah
[18/11/2022, 01:35:00] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[18/11/2022, 01:35:07] Alex Regueiro: It's very liberal-individualistic, and spoilt in some ways. (Not that our generation isn't.)
[18/11/2022, 01:35:12] Alice Lafferty: It doesn't feel that way at Cambridge.
[18/11/2022, 01:36:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh sure, but Cambs students are hardly typical, are they? But you can find plenty of those types in NE London / SW Essex. Or a quick gander on social media.
[18/11/2022, 01:36:30] Alex Regueiro: And I'm sure there are still some of them there üòâ
[18/11/2022, 01:36:32] Alice Lafferty: Yes definitely.
[18/11/2022, 01:37:28] Alice Lafferty: But you probably showed interest in me because of rather than despite of my age.
[18/11/2022, 01:37:30] Alex Regueiro: Or indeed on OKC!
[18/11/2022, 01:37:44] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean?
[18/11/2022, 01:38:24] Alice Lafferty: Another thing is that people don't seem to realise that culture is actually animated by the trespass of social norms...
[18/11/2022, 01:38:32] Alex Regueiro: You might find it amusing that I'd set my lower age limit on OKC to 21 (kind of arbitrarily), but fairly recently changed it to 20 out of slight frustration of the sort of people I was seeing. I definitely noted at some level that Zoomers are a more diverse bunch in terms of outlooks!
[18/11/2022, 01:39:16] Alex Regueiro: Born about 1970?
[18/11/2022, 01:39:23] Alex Regueiro: Or late 60s, rather
[18/11/2022, 01:39:33] Alice Lafferty: And if there are no social norms left, there is nothing to subvert. No 'vitality'. Even a word like 'frisson' would work'
[18/11/2022, 01:39:50] Alice Lafferty: I'm just thinking.. she was born in 68
[18/11/2022, 01:40:35] Alex Regueiro: Yes, there's plenty of evidence towards that, psychological and sociological. Taboos are both important in and of themselves and in serving as a threshold to be occasionally crossed... or so it seems!
[18/11/2022, 01:40:38] Alice Lafferty: I've been shown people outside of the age range I selected anyway so
[18/11/2022, 01:41:10] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I think that's why the right is really intellectually exciting right now.
[18/11/2022, 01:41:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it must take liberties when other criteria aren't easily satisfied eh? I saw it too. (What was your range, may I ask?)
[18/11/2022, 01:41:52] Alice Lafferty: I think 20-35?
[18/11/2022, 01:42:16] Alex Regueiro: Right. Without this massive surge left culturally in the past 20 years, I think the right would have been bereft of ideas.
[18/11/2022, 01:42:20] Alex Regueiro: Sort of like how the left is becoming now
[18/11/2022, 01:42:35] Alex Regueiro: (Okay, I hate the 1D spectrum, but we'll stick with it for convenience for now)
[18/11/2022, 01:42:57] Alice Lafferty: I didn't have a membership/'premium' whatever, so couldn't be that selective.
[18/11/2022, 01:43:06] Alex Regueiro: Very reasonable, especially given your maturity in many respects, like I was saying
[18/11/2022, 01:43:29] Alex Regueiro: I think I signed up for a trial membership but that's it
[18/11/2022, 01:44:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes, it's like what do they have? Kamala Harris? There's no glamour.
[18/11/2022, 01:45:04] Alex Regueiro: And Keir Starmer isn't much of an improvement. Just saying his name is tedious.
[18/11/2022, 01:45:48] Alice Lafferty: I decided to that because being in a relationship with someone older than me would soothe a lot of my concerns about our respective declines in sexual desirability.
[18/11/2022, 01:45:56] Alex Regueiro: Upcoming US elections will be very interesting. Dems will be struggling to get any half-decent non-geriatric candidate, while I can see DeSantis and Trump at each other's throats in the Rep primaries
[18/11/2022, 01:46:26] Alex Regueiro: I didn't even think of that one, but I suppose it makes sense. In that men tail off later in terms of desirability?
[18/11/2022, 01:46:32] Alice Lafferty: I think the dems will literally prevent Biden from running again by whatever means possible.
[18/11/2022, 01:47:17] Alice Lafferty: Trump will have far less spunky underdog energy this time round... could be DeSantis.
[18/11/2022, 01:47:23] Alice Lafferty: Although I don't know much about him.
[18/11/2022, 01:47:51] Alex Regueiro: Yep. But Kamala was seen as the obvious successor when they won the last one, and forget it now, she'd be suicide for the party at this point.
[18/11/2022, 01:48:38] Alex Regueiro: I hope it is. I haven't ever really been a mindless Trump-basher, but his personality is repugnant in the extreme and he's even less fit a leader now than he was before.
[18/11/2022, 01:49:26] Alex Regueiro: DeSantis shares a lot in common, but he's significantly more intelligent, and a bit more pragmatic. I don't like his stance on guns and a few other things, but his general social conservatism and economic pragmatism are slightly appealing. But yeah, I don't know a great deal either
[18/11/2022, 01:49:45] Alice Lafferty: Yes. If when I am say, 35, he is 50, we are on a more level playing field. I think it would avoid some issues within the marriage.
[18/11/2022, 01:50:06] Alice Lafferty: Stable option, right?
[18/11/2022, 01:50:37] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure the British media will start covering this and develop their positions when the elections roll round.
[18/11/2022, 01:50:55] Alice Lafferty: He was very entertaining though!
[18/11/2022, 01:52:08] Alex Regueiro: You've really thought this through, haven't you? That's a good point. Even though I doubt desirability needs to be a primary concern. If both partners have personalities more on the sedate and faithful side, rather than thrill-seeking or hedonistic, that can offset any difference in desirability to a large extent, I'd think
[18/11/2022, 01:52:12] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, he was hilarious
[18/11/2022, 01:52:24] Alice Lafferty: Idk who the dems will pick then.. maybe that Buttgieg guy
[18/11/2022, 01:52:35] Alice Lafferty: Wrong spelling!
[18/11/2022, 01:52:48] Alex Regueiro: Which was fine for a while, until you thought everything could go to pot domestically or internationally.
[18/11/2022, 01:53:04] Alex Regueiro: But one of the things I'd actually commend him on is not being a warmonger or even a real supporter of the MIC!
[18/11/2022, 01:53:57] Alex Regueiro: One of the few names that's spelt wrong even more often than mine!
[18/11/2022, 01:54:58] Alice Lafferty: Yes. I've thought about it a lot. All the same, I suppose I'd feel 'guilty' that this perfectly desirable & active 35 year old man was stuck with me, who is considerably less attractive. But at 50, he would also be winding down a bit. Maybe fallen victim to ED by then etc..
[18/11/2022, 01:55:36] Alice Lafferty: Yes he was basically an isolationist wasn't he
[18/11/2022, 01:55:37] Alex Regueiro: Buttigeg (or whatever the spelling) is someone I actually looked at a bit in the last elections. He was probably my favourite Dem candidate.
[18/11/2022, 01:56:04] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, too much for my liking, even though - as you know - I strongly support self sufficiency in a few areas like energy and food.
[18/11/2022, 01:56:11] Alex Regueiro: and some manufacturing
[18/11/2022, 01:56:33] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I don't know much about him either but I definitely noticed him. He seemed capable, neutral.
[18/11/2022, 01:57:48] Alex Regueiro: Hah, I think you worry too much, but I do get you... Sex drive is an interesting thing, as some men and women seem to lose it fairly young (or not have a big one to begin with), while others keep going well into old age. So I'm told!
[18/11/2022, 01:58:31] Alice Lafferty: Imo all those stories about STDs in care homes are invented for gross-out effect.
[18/11/2022, 01:58:45] Alex Regueiro: Right. Nothing extreme or too worrying. My ideal candidate right now might actually be some frankenstein hybrid of Buttigeg and DeSantis!
[18/11/2022, 01:58:57] Alex Regueiro: (if that's even possible, being so far apart on many issues haha)
[18/11/2022, 01:59:14] Alex Regueiro: I've only heard of them in passing, but I wouldn't be surprised yep
[18/11/2022, 01:59:16] Alice Lafferty: It's broadly true that men are less interested in 'spreading their wild oats' at 50 than 25 or 35.
[18/11/2022, 01:59:26] Alice Lafferty: True centrist.
[18/11/2022, 01:59:26] Alex Regueiro: BTW, when do you turn 21, out of curiosity?
[18/11/2022, 01:59:49] Alex Regueiro: For sure
[18/11/2022, 01:59:56] Alice Lafferty: 9th May 2023.
[18/11/2022, 02:00:08] Alex Regueiro: Though even between 25 and 35 there's usually a big difference
[18/11/2022, 02:01:02] Alex Regueiro: Ooh. That's the day my grandfather would have turned 100!
[18/11/2022, 02:01:08] Alex Regueiro: A good birthday in any case
[18/11/2022, 02:01:19] Alice Lafferty: Maybe? But I'd say men command the most sexual attention in their 30s, and may want to make use of it.
[18/11/2022, 02:01:35] Alice Lafferty: It's ok! When's yours?
[18/11/2022, 02:02:01] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's true. Their sex drive is usually higher at 25 though
[18/11/2022, 02:02:04] Alex Regueiro: 12th June
[18/11/2022, 02:03:03] Alice Lafferty: Actually quite close then. It's good to have your birthday a good distance from Christmas.
‚Äé[18/11/2022, 02:03:06] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[18/11/2022, 02:03:07] Alex Regueiro: And Anthony Eden
[18/11/2022, 02:03:12] Alice Lafferty: So the year is nicely bisected with presents.
[18/11/2022, 02:03:45] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that was really nice growing up. These days I don't expect much in terms of presents, and I'm trying to be less materialistic anyway, but it's still a plus.
[18/11/2022, 02:03:57] Alex Regueiro: Poor old Isaac Newton... actually, somehow doubt he cared
[18/11/2022, 02:05:08] Alice Lafferty: Me too. I'm sort of uncomfortable receiving presents from my parents because they let me live with them/feed me when by rights I should have moved out.
[18/11/2022, 02:05:49] Alice Lafferty: Also, I don't really enjoy the whole present-giving ritual.
[18/11/2022, 02:06:29] Alice Lafferty: He was born on Christmas day or something? It was probably beneath him
[18/11/2022, 02:06:29] Alex Regueiro: It's a bit artificial and too performative, aside from the materialism. But it's still somehow a good way of showing your affection for someone.
[18/11/2022, 02:06:34] Alex Regueiro: yeah he was
[18/11/2022, 02:06:43] Alex Regueiro: 1643 if I remember right
[18/11/2022, 02:07:04] Alex Regueiro: Or maybe 42
[18/11/2022, 02:07:10] Alice Lafferty: It says on Wikipedia 4th January.
[18/11/2022, 02:07:26] Alex Regueiro: in New Style yeah
[18/11/2022, 02:07:32] Alex Regueiro: but Old Style on Christmas Day
[18/11/2022, 02:07:57] Alice Lafferty: Ohh
[18/11/2022, 02:07:54] Alex Regueiro: Being a theologian, I presume you know about these things üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 02:08:19] Alice Lafferty: I never make the connection to account for it when looking retrospectively at old dates you know.
[18/11/2022, 02:08:21] Alex Regueiro: Says 25th Dec in the main article. But you headed straight for the infobox... I like that!
[18/11/2022, 02:09:20] Alice Lafferty: Not very thorough!
[18/11/2022, 02:11:18] Alex Regueiro: So... you share your birthday with Billy Joel, Alan Bennett, and J.M. Barrie
[18/11/2022, 02:11:27] Alex Regueiro: Not too bad a bunch
[18/11/2022, 02:11:30] Alex Regueiro: Beats me at least
[18/11/2022, 02:15:35] Alex Regueiro: This is a nice point to say good night... good night!
[18/11/2022, 02:19:25] Alice Lafferty: Ok good night. Sorry if I kept you up.
[18/11/2022, 02:20:56] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. I always enjoy our chats very much.
[18/11/2022, 02:21:01] Alex Regueiro: Sleep well
[18/11/2022, 02:21:26] Alice Lafferty: Ok good
[18/11/2022, 21:11:45] Alice Lafferty: What do you think about the twitter fiasco? Is it going to become unusable or is that an exaggeration?
[18/11/2022, 21:25:11] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[18/11/2022, 21:25:21] Alex Regueiro: This is pretty eccentric even by Musk's standards!
[18/11/2022, 21:25:43] Alex Regueiro: I know he's a real workaholic and expects others to do the same, but this isn't terribly realistic... unless he plans to outsource everything to India?
[18/11/2022, 21:48:22] Alex Regueiro: Or do you mean the stuff with blue ticks, or all the advertisers pulling out?
[18/11/2022, 22:17:26] Alice Lafferty: I meant the huge mass exodus of staff
[18/11/2022, 22:19:15] Alice Lafferty: It would be a shame if it went down because when used correctly it's a good repository of information/interesting people.
[18/11/2022, 22:20:35] Alice Lafferty: Another question: do you know SQL?
‚Äé[18/11/2022, 22:23:22] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[18/11/2022, 22:23:27] Alex Regueiro: "when used correctly" is a serious qualification, but I don't disagree... I don't think he wants to ruin it, just his ultimatum is a bit extreme
[18/11/2022, 22:23:54] Alex Regueiro: Was semi optimistic he'd reform it in the right way when he bought it. Still a chance. Not that it will ever tempt be back on!
[18/11/2022, 22:24:13] Alex Regueiro: I do. A tad rusty but certainly the basics. Are you trying to use it?
[18/11/2022, 22:24:16] Alice Lafferty: Word on the street from people employed at faang...
[18/11/2022, 22:24:43] Alice Lafferty: No, I was just wondering.
[18/11/2022, 22:26:16] Alice Lafferty: I have an account and after doggedly clicking 'not interested' on inflammatory bait material and not tweeting myself, I actually got quite good use out of it.
[18/11/2022, 22:26:58] Alex Regueiro: The tech bubble may well burst, but will the Silicon Valley cultural bubble burst too? I suspect not.
[18/11/2022, 22:27:51] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah. I have an account too, but only for reading things news or the odd thing
[18/11/2022, 22:28:16] Alex Regueiro: Never tweet, is the lesson. And get sucked into the vortex of barbarity.
[18/11/2022, 22:29:15] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I don't know. It is making me reconsider the utility of learning programming.
[18/11/2022, 22:30:04] Alice Lafferty: I guess stuff will be archived?
[18/11/2022, 22:30:49] Alex Regueiro: Mainly for current affairs and commentary I take it?
[18/11/2022, 22:31:22] Alex Regueiro: Often. But even if it doesn't, I'm just convinced it's not constructive use of time or conducive to a good mental state.
[18/11/2022, 22:31:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes and for some interesting apolitical science/history/religion content.
[18/11/2022, 22:32:22] Alex Regueiro: The tech bubble bursting will just mean these the tech won't continue to see ridiculous growth and general investment in the space will be more moderate. It's still a huge industry with plenty of opportunities. I would follow your heart on this point. üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 22:32:44] Alex Regueiro: It will still be*
[18/11/2022, 22:32:52] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, most of it is not productive. It scratches the same itch as like flipping through a magazine.
[18/11/2022, 22:34:50] Alex Regueiro: Right. You go there for a quick dopamine hit, though if you're not so lucky (most of the time) you'll see some idiocy that will frustrate you or put you in a sulk. Or you'll get in an utterly pointless argument with a stranger. I speak from experience. I half-properly thought through how I'd reform the platform at one point, and attaching real identities and highly restricting replies would be two of the main things.
[18/11/2022, 22:34:55] Alice Lafferty: Withdrawal of investment plus lowering barriers of entry into job market doesn't make it look super favourable to me. And in complete honesty my 'heart' is not in it..
[18/11/2022, 22:35:05] Alice Lafferty: It was just a pragmatic option.
[18/11/2022, 22:35:21] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I sort of thought this. Totally fair.
[18/11/2022, 22:36:04] Alex Regueiro: It's a bit like investment banking. That 'bubble' burst in 2008 and still hasn't fully recovered. There are plenty of careers in the sector still, but it's lost its lustre, for good reason.
[18/11/2022, 22:36:34] Alice Lafferty: That's interesting because as far as I could tell the anonymity was a large part of what permitted various exciting subcultures to arise.
[18/11/2022, 22:36:34] Alex Regueiro: Sometimes I get fed up of software development myself, and would rather keep it just as a hobby. Quite often, in fact. Other times it's more appealing.
[18/11/2022, 22:36:53] Alex Regueiro: It's also what encouraged some of the most vile behaviour and dehumanisation, I'd say.
[18/11/2022, 22:37:14] Alice Lafferty: I am SO easily baited too.
[18/11/2022, 22:37:46] Alice Lafferty: Yes true...
[18/11/2022, 22:38:08] Alice Lafferty: Well, what would you do instead?
[18/11/2022, 22:38:38] Alex Regueiro: And the echo chamber / groupthink was probably exacerbated by it too, since people can be more extreme in what they say... possibly? It's certainly very fractured/suburbanised.
[18/11/2022, 22:39:12] Alice Lafferty: I guess anonymity allows you to hash out ideas casually without staking your public reputation on them...
[18/11/2022, 22:39:22] Alex Regueiro: Yep. It took me a while to come to the full realisation, but it was an important thing to learn about myself. I developed a slightly thicker skin over time, but if I was having a bad day (or moment), it was still an awful place to be
[18/11/2022, 22:39:29] Alice Lafferty: But I agree has huge drawbacks too.
[18/11/2022, 22:39:37] Alex Regueiro: There's absolutely this plus side, I'm just not sure it outweighs the big issues it creates.
[18/11/2022, 22:40:33] Alice Lafferty: Yes but wasn't this a problem as far back as print media? I think basically people like interacting primarily with their in-groups and that won't change.
[18/11/2022, 22:40:43] Alex Regueiro: That's the question. I thought academia for a while, but that has its own unique downsides for me. Could potentially do a tech startup and take a more hands-off role, but the stars will have to align for that.
[18/11/2022, 22:41:11] Alice Lafferty: Do you ever out of boredom get this demonic urge to actually go and seek out triggering content?
[18/11/2022, 22:41:36] Alex Regueiro: Yes, though the nature of the medium (ubiquity, instantaneity, sheer quantity of information) lead to some pretty huge divergences in effect I'd say
[18/11/2022, 22:42:02] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes. It happened more than occasionally on Twitter, and it was super unhealthy
[18/11/2022, 22:42:42] Alice Lafferty: Somebody else was telling me recently that most advances in machine learning are happening in universities rather than in the private sector... I remember you saying that was something you're interested in.
[18/11/2022, 22:42:53] Alice Lafferty: Although all my information is second hand mind.
[18/11/2022, 22:43:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. More on the computational neuroscience end. Flirted with doing a PhD back in my mid 20s, spoke to the professor who led the research group at Oxford (very eccentric but nice guy), but it didn't work out in the end.
[18/11/2022, 22:44:20] Alice Lafferty: It's never too late..
[18/11/2022, 22:44:21] Alex Regueiro: A large part of me would love to just study and do research of my own choice most of the time... it's not the most realistic option though. Financially I'm pretty comfortable for various reasons, but still.
[18/11/2022, 22:44:32] Alice Lafferty: Plus you'd have to teach?
[18/11/2022, 22:44:54] Alice Lafferty: Although maybe that wouldn't be a problem for you
[18/11/2022, 22:45:04] Alex Regueiro: I mean perhaps as an independent researcher. That eliminates some of the issues with academic jobs...
[18/11/2022, 22:45:14] Alex Regueiro: I like teaching actually, albeit with some provisos.
[18/11/2022, 22:45:32] Alex Regueiro: Have you thought any more about your education/career/future lately?
[18/11/2022, 22:45:54] Alice Lafferty: How long do you foresee working for this current start-up?
[18/11/2022, 22:46:01] Alice Lafferty: I know you said it's stalled a bit or something?
[18/11/2022, 22:47:08] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, mainly because there founder is so focused on securing the funding, and as a contractor, I had no obvious little project to do next... Might pick up again at some point. I'm doing some other software dev work to tie me over now, but my mind is thinking more of medium/long term.
[18/11/2022, 22:47:41] Alice Lafferty: Haha sorry I don't want to treat you as some kind of careers advisor!
[18/11/2022, 22:48:07] Alex Regueiro: Oh I was just curious though. Genuinely.
[18/11/2022, 22:48:11] Alice Lafferty: But do you know what the general status of a degree from the Open University?
[18/11/2022, 22:48:15] Alice Lafferty: *is
[18/11/2022, 22:48:27] Alex Regueiro: As long as it's not the *first* think you think of my as, I'm happy with it. üòâ
[18/11/2022, 22:48:47] Alex Regueiro: Varies hugely. Depends on the degree and the circumstances.
[18/11/2022, 22:49:06] Alice Lafferty: I see.
[18/11/2022, 22:49:18] Alex Regueiro: So, two people I know come to mind when I think of the Open University...
[18/11/2022, 22:49:32] Alice Lafferty: I was being really pessimistic earlier. There will obviously always be SWE roles because the technology is completely embedded in society.
[18/11/2022, 22:49:46] Alice Lafferty: So I'm sure you will be fine whatever direction you choose to go in.
[18/11/2022, 22:49:51] Alex Regueiro: One is my mum. When she got fed up working in PR, she got a teaching qualification from there, and it did her very nicely!
[18/11/2022, 22:50:29] Alex Regueiro: The other is this mathematician who's a researcher there, whom I worked with a bit on some open source software a few years back. He seemed to have a really nice lifestyle in some ways.
[18/11/2022, 22:50:36] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Sounds promising.
[18/11/2022, 22:51:48] Alex Regueiro: I don't blame you for being a little sceptical though, since it all rests upon industries that are much more obviously useful to society. The contemporary West is the golden age of "symbol manipulators", though, as Lasch would call it
[18/11/2022, 22:52:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Studied part-time, it really suited her back then.
[18/11/2022, 22:52:19] Alice Lafferty: I asked because I need to get some kind of qualification, but struggle in traditional university environment/ living with other students etc.
[18/11/2022, 22:52:33] Alex Regueiro: I thought so. üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 22:52:47] Alex Regueiro: Honestly not the worst choice... depending on what degree you want to get, of course, and how you want to use it.
[18/11/2022, 22:52:50] Alex Regueiro: There's also Birkbeck?
[18/11/2022, 22:53:47] Alice Lafferty: I would have said the managerial/academic/journalism roles/HR/PR were the 'symbol manipulators'... SWEs actually build things.
[18/11/2022, 22:54:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, though he has a pretty broad definition. Anyone who works more with abstract ideas and structures than physical things.
[18/11/2022, 22:54:42] Alice Lafferty: I know that it won't make me very competitive.
[18/11/2022, 22:54:44] Alex Regueiro: It's a useful label in some sense, though he perhaps overdoes it
[18/11/2022, 22:55:11] Alex Regueiro: It totally depends what you want to do with it. Of course, I hardly expect you to have your life all mapped out neatly at 20.
[18/11/2022, 22:56:09] Alice Lafferty: I'm motivated to a certain extent by money, yes, but more so by job security and routine.
[18/11/2022, 22:56:55] Alex Regueiro: Is a job that holds your interest and stimulates very important too?
[18/11/2022, 22:57:10] Alice Lafferty: Best to have some idea though.
[18/11/2022, 22:57:24] Alice Lafferty: And to not have embarked on a mickey mouse degree.
[18/11/2022, 22:57:40] Alice Lafferty: Ehh, beggars can't be choosers.
[18/11/2022, 22:57:48] Alex Regueiro: Yes, for sure. You can always "pivot" later, per the startup lingo, though ideally not a complete U-turn
[18/11/2022, 22:58:12] Alice Lafferty: I don't mind if it's not something I'm supper Passionate about.
[18/11/2022, 22:58:13] Alex Regueiro: It's really not. It just doesn't have amazing job prospects
[18/11/2022, 22:58:56] Alice Lafferty: Sorry to keep talking about myself by the way.
[18/11/2022, 22:59:12] Alex Regueiro: Don't be. I asked, after all. üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 22:59:51] Alice Lafferty: I was thinking of doing either Data Science or Chem and going into research... something like that.
[18/11/2022, 23:00:30] Alex Regueiro: Both those have plenty of opportunities! Would you do it at the OU or similar, or a traditional university?
[18/11/2022, 23:00:41] Alex Regueiro: I do think research would suit you nicely anyway
[18/11/2022, 23:01:10] Alex Regueiro: And chemistry has lots of research role, of course, not just in academia
[18/11/2022, 23:01:12] Alice Lafferty: But because anyone can get a degree from an ex-polytechnic now, employees select for prestige of universities. This is how it is in law, according to my dad at least.
[18/11/2022, 23:01:40] Alice Lafferty: Yes OU.
[18/11/2022, 23:01:51] Alex Regueiro: It is. There's so much degree inflation that employers don't really have a choice except to use it as a major criterion.
[18/11/2022, 23:02:51] Alex Regueiro: It does make it harder, but I entirely get why the OU might suit you better. You could take a non-standard route into academia, if you went that way. It's more feasible these days than in the past, I'd argue.
[18/11/2022, 23:03:12] Alex Regueiro: At least, if you really excel at your subject. Not if you're just a run-of-the-mill researcher.
[18/11/2022, 23:03:40] Alice Lafferty: I've really scaled down my ambitions a lot over the last year or so. So getting a degree is kind of perfunctory rather than a real pursuit of interest.
[18/11/2022, 23:04:00] Alex Regueiro: Worst case, you can join and go to the woods and 'live deliberately'. üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 23:04:04] Alex Regueiro: join me*
[18/11/2022, 23:04:22] Alex Regueiro: Such are the constraints modern society puts on us...
[18/11/2022, 23:04:44] Alice Lafferty: If it enables me to get a job even in some shit-tier role then it'll probably do.
[18/11/2022, 23:04:53] Alice Lafferty: Thank you for talking to me about it anyway.
[18/11/2022, 23:04:54] Alex Regueiro: It would
[18/11/2022, 23:05:07] Alex Regueiro: And I think you could rise quite rapidly with a bit of luck
[18/11/2022, 23:05:24] Alex Regueiro: No problem at all
[18/11/2022, 23:05:29] Alice Lafferty: My parents have been out of the job market for so long, they don't really have much advice.
[18/11/2022, 23:05:44] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[18/11/2022, 23:06:20] Alice Lafferty: If you keep your expectations modest, you will never be disappointed...
[18/11/2022, 23:06:37] Alice Lafferty: Also, 'attachment is the root of suffering'. These are my new mantras.
[18/11/2022, 23:07:07] Alex Regueiro: You seem to have your head screwed on thinking about this though. You clearly know what sort of things will suit your personality and lifestyle well and what won't
[18/11/2022, 23:07:15] Alex Regueiro: Hah
[18/11/2022, 23:07:38] Alex Regueiro: Buddhist monk is always an option! I think there are a few progressive sects that admit women üòâ
[18/11/2022, 23:08:13] Alice Lafferty: Or, closer to home, simply a nunnery.
[18/11/2022, 23:08:41] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwVNuyfhF0Q
[18/11/2022, 23:08:53] Alice Lafferty: Yes, that's why I thought tech for a bit because I could kind of go hermit mode...
[18/11/2022, 23:09:19] Alex Regueiro: True. You're already versed in some of the doctrine, and the rejection of possessions and the material world is the implicit version of Buddhism!
[18/11/2022, 23:09:47] Alice Lafferty: ! üòÇ
[18/11/2022, 23:10:03] Alice Lafferty: Correct.
[18/11/2022, 23:10:21] Alex Regueiro: But seriously, that's rational. Aim slightly high but keep expectations slightly low.
[18/11/2022, 23:10:36] Alex Regueiro: Homer Simpson is the sage we all need. Who would have guessed?
[18/11/2022, 23:11:22] Alice Lafferty: Have not watched in ages but he seemed to have a job essentially minding a button in a power station right.
[18/11/2022, 23:12:12] Alice Lafferty: Actually nuclear energy was another industry I was kind of interested in... only because I'm personally a huge advocate for it as a clean energy.
[18/11/2022, 23:13:27] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of similiar to a train driver. They get paid ¬£70k a year to essentially push and pull a lever. RMT run a kind of racket.
[18/11/2022, 23:13:36] Alex Regueiro: Hah right! He's inspiration for us all. If someone of his intelligence and qualification can get a cushy job like that and provide for his family, we're all going to be grand.
[18/11/2022, 23:14:18] Alex Regueiro: More wisdom for the next time you're feeling down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfpPArfDTGw
[18/11/2022, 23:15:03] Alice Lafferty: Wait is this from the movie?
[18/11/2022, 23:15:41] Alice Lafferty: Idk why that movie got panned I thought it was pretty good. Or at least I definitely did when I was like 12.
[18/11/2022, 23:15:32] Alex Regueiro: Haha exactly. Honestly ever time I think of Tube drivers and how they get paid 60k starting salary after 6 months basic training, for 32 hours a week or something... and bucketloads of holidays... Well, I try to switch focus, or I just get incredibly annoyed and resentful.
[18/11/2022, 23:16:01] Alex Regueiro: Yup. The quality of the series had started nosediving by then, but the movie is somehow pretty good still. üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 23:16:20] Alice Lafferty: Apparently it's really nepotistic.
[18/11/2022, 23:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Yep I believe it. Racket/mafia seems like an accurate description
[18/11/2022, 23:16:45] Alex Regueiro: Do you remember Bob Crow?
[18/11/2022, 23:16:55] Alice Lafferty: No...
[18/11/2022, 23:17:24] Alex Regueiro: The previous and infamous head of the RMT. Died young.
[18/11/2022, 23:17:37] Alex Regueiro: He secured most of the ridiculous concessions from TFL and the rail lines I think
[18/11/2022, 23:17:46] Alice Lafferty: Ohh.
[18/11/2022, 23:18:15] Alex Regueiro: Anyway my mum taught his daughter. He literally didn't show up to any parents' evenings, and the only time they hear from him was a message of solidarity when the teachers decided to strike once haha
[18/11/2022, 23:18:43] Alice Lafferty: 'Nooo you can't use a machine, how else will we keep our 500000 'inspectors' employed??'
[18/11/2022, 23:19:19] Alex Regueiro: Hah exactly. And they've been resisting automation of the Tube for years and years now...
[18/11/2022, 23:19:38] Alice Lafferty: Ha, devoted to the cause ü´°
[18/11/2022, 23:19:50] Alex Regueiro: Even though partial automation has been feasible for a long time and would mean increases in efficiency and big savings.
[18/11/2022, 23:20:10] Alice Lafferty: Yes. No other industry is insulated from redundancies.
[18/11/2022, 23:20:18] Alice Lafferty: You should talk to my dad about this.
[18/11/2022, 23:20:40] Alice Lafferty: He's been personally aggrieved by all the strikes.
[18/11/2022, 23:20:43] Alex Regueiro: Can't fault his commitment. Maybe his daughter's education will suffer but... what's that next to the might of the working proletariat?!
[18/11/2022, 23:21:55] Alex Regueiro: My dad and him would probably have a first-rate whinge together.
[18/11/2022, 23:22:14] Alex Regueiro: and he*
[18/11/2022, 23:22:27] Alice Lafferty: Do you also have a centre-right father and centre-left mother?
[18/11/2022, 23:22:43] Alice Lafferty: It seems to be the most common configuration..
[18/11/2022, 23:22:48] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes
[18/11/2022, 23:23:06] Alice Lafferty: They get along pretty well anyhow
[18/11/2022, 23:23:22] Alex Regueiro: My dad is definitely centre-right on most things, and proper conservative or a tad liberal on the odd thing
[18/11/2022, 23:23:39] Alex Regueiro: Mum is similar just a bit softer and more measured in her views I'd say
[18/11/2022, 23:23:47] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of weird how this doesn't seem to show up in voting patterns though.
[18/11/2022, 23:24:05] Alex Regueiro: It's funny how this configuration seems to work a lot better than centre-right woman and centre-left man.
[18/11/2022, 23:24:25] Alice Lafferty: I honestly don't really know any such couples
[18/11/2022, 23:24:37] Alex Regueiro: (purely anecdotal / armchair psychology evidence)
[18/11/2022, 23:24:38] Alex Regueiro: yep
[18/11/2022, 23:24:44] Alex Regueiro: point in case!
[18/11/2022, 23:25:25] Alex Regueiro: BTW, speaking of unions... reminded me of that great song by the Strawbs, Part of the Union. I take it you know it? üôÇ
[18/11/2022, 23:25:33] Alice Lafferty: Same, esp economically. Like he was initially supportive of Truss' tax cuts.
[18/11/2022, 23:26:07] Alex Regueiro: My dad actually thought they were stupid given the circumstances, though long-term he's usually pro tax cuts on individuals.
[18/11/2022, 23:26:09] Alice Lafferty: My mum is kind of (in the nicest way possible) a champagne socialist.
[18/11/2022, 23:26:28] Alex Regueiro: Haha I was leaning towards that impression but didn't want to say.
[18/11/2022, 23:26:43] Alice Lafferty: Yes he retreated pretty quickly on that argument when it all went tits up
[18/11/2022, 23:26:52] Alex Regueiro: Given I haven't even met her. (And I know how I hate people judging me too soon.)
[18/11/2022, 23:27:22] Alice Lafferty: It's ok, it's something she's admitted herself.
[18/11/2022, 23:27:54] Alex Regueiro: I've had champagne socialist friends though, so... I just take the piss every once in a while when a good opportunity reveals itself.
[18/11/2022, 23:28:12] Alex Regueiro: And full-on socialist friends too for that matter
[18/11/2022, 23:28:39] Alex Regueiro: My family is really quite a mix in terms of grandparents and cousins.
[18/11/2022, 23:28:44] Alice Lafferty: How could you not, isn't that a large proportion of London/Oxford?
[18/11/2022, 23:28:49] Alice Lafferty: *population
[18/11/2022, 23:29:42] Alice Lafferty: I think I've only really known student pseuds
[18/11/2022, 23:30:00] Alice Lafferty: I mean, I was one myself briefly
[18/11/2022, 23:30:02] Alex Regueiro: London has some conservative hotspots is most places are like Islington lite at best, yep...
[18/11/2022, 23:30:26] Alex Regueiro: Oxford is very mixed I found. A bit bipolar even, though predominantly progressive/liberal still
[18/11/2022, 23:30:33] Alex Regueiro: Ooh, what variety?
[18/11/2022, 23:31:05] Alice Lafferty: Whatever political identity you can think of, I adopted it at one point in my teens.
[18/11/2022, 23:31:15] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[18/11/2022, 23:31:50] Alex Regueiro: Now does that make you really open-minded and introspective or just wet and lily-livered?
[18/11/2022, 23:31:51] Alice Lafferty: My thing was particularly Marxist Feminism (Alexandra Kollantai).
[18/11/2022, 23:31:54] Alex Regueiro: I'll go with the first!
[18/11/2022, 23:32:02] Alice Lafferty: It makes me impressionable and fickle.
[18/11/2022, 23:32:10] Alice Lafferty: And unserious.
[18/11/2022, 23:32:17] Alex Regueiro: You've worked your way through a lot of ideas though, at least
[18/11/2022, 23:32:23] Alex Regueiro: I don't know this Kollantai... but interesting.
[18/11/2022, 23:32:52] Alex Regueiro: I was attracted by critical theory when I was younger to be fair. And a few progressive positions.
[18/11/2022, 23:33:05] Alice Lafferty: It was more like trying out clothes for size.
[18/11/2022, 23:33:17] Alex Regueiro: Then went through a long period of being a classical liberal, borderline libertarian, then a conservative-liberal of sorts like now.
[18/11/2022, 23:33:27] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I think it's really revelatory and invigorating the first time you encounter it.
[18/11/2022, 23:33:37] Alex Regueiro: And they turned out to be pretty baggy eh?
[18/11/2022, 23:33:40] Alice Lafferty: 'Burkean'
[18/11/2022, 23:33:45] Alex Regueiro: indeed
[18/11/2022, 23:34:04] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[18/11/2022, 23:34:07] Alex Regueiro: Though I really do need to read an original Burke text in its full before I can claim that fairly!
[18/11/2022, 23:34:32] Alex Regueiro: We've moved on, but I'm still curious...
[18/11/2022, 23:34:58] Alice Lafferty: Haha, don't worry. I think loads of people claim allegiance to thinkers they've only ever read in secondary literature.
[18/11/2022, 23:35:15] Alice Lafferty: Sorry yes I forgot to answer
[18/11/2022, 23:35:20] Alice Lafferty: Yes I do
[18/11/2022, 23:35:28] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to nod enthusiastically in agreement, whether it's true or not.
[18/11/2022, 23:35:41] Alex Regueiro: Oh good. Just checking
[18/11/2022, 23:35:46] Alex Regueiro: That song usually makes me smile
[18/11/2022, 23:36:35] Alice Lafferty: I should show it to my dad actually
[18/11/2022, 23:36:39] Alex Regueiro: I mean, whether it's valid or not
[18/11/2022, 23:37:07] Alice Lafferty: When was it written actually?
[18/11/2022, 23:37:19] Alice Lafferty: Not the winter of discontent?
[18/11/2022, 23:37:21] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. 70s? Early 80s?
[18/11/2022, 23:37:22] Alice Lafferty: Like 79?
[18/11/2022, 23:37:23] Alex Regueiro: Could well be
[18/11/2022, 23:37:29] Alice Lafferty: Well, that would make sense
[18/11/2022, 23:37:57] Alex Regueiro: I thought about it too at one point. The miners' strikes in the mid 80s is another good possibility.
[18/11/2022, 23:38:05] Alex Regueiro: Ah no, 73!
[18/11/2022, 23:38:18] Alice Lafferty: ? Huh that's really interesting.
[18/11/2022, 23:38:43] Alice Lafferty: That seems much earlier than when strikes really started causing strife in the UK
[18/11/2022, 23:38:49] Alex Regueiro: All the unions were proper rackets with the leaders getting backhanders from politicians, back then
[18/11/2022, 23:38:54] Alice Lafferty: Unless I'm just unfamiliar with the history.
[18/11/2022, 23:38:59] Alex Regueiro: At least that's the impression I get from Yes Minister, which I'm sure is 100% accurate.
[18/11/2022, 23:39:24] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, might have been some over deindustrialisation though, which began in the 60s?
[18/11/2022, 23:39:43] Alice Lafferty: Yes or making plain ridiculous demands.
[18/11/2022, 23:40:04] Alice Lafferty: It's weird because they should work in theory.
[18/11/2022, 23:40:47] Alice Lafferty: Yes could be. I only really know the 78/79 strikes triggered by Ford and then the Arthur Scargill generation. I'm sure there was much more to it.
[18/11/2022, 23:41:13] Alex Regueiro: I'm pro unions as a concept, but with the proper restrictions especially on balloting. I don't think there's enough still. The RMT have gotten away with murder before and are doing so again.
[18/11/2022, 23:41:32] Alice Lafferty: How do they differ from guilds?
[18/11/2022, 23:41:58] Alex Regueiro: Guilds are compulsory to operate in the sector. That's the main difference as I see it.
[18/11/2022, 23:42:12] Alice Lafferty: Ah.
[18/11/2022, 23:42:12] Alex Regueiro: And they were supposedly set up to protect standards and quality of workmanship
[18/11/2022, 23:42:14] Alex Regueiro: more than workers' rights
[18/11/2022, 23:42:20] Alex Regueiro: but they declined a long long time ago
[18/11/2022, 23:42:27] Alex Regueiro: 1800s?
[18/11/2022, 23:43:19] Alice Lafferty: Yes. I only know the quaint medieval cobbler's guild or whatever.
[18/11/2022, 23:43:30] Alice Lafferty: I don't know how they functioned in reality.
[18/11/2022, 23:44:01] Alice Lafferty: I don't really see how they could they prevent people from working outside the guild, but still
[18/11/2022, 23:44:43] Alex Regueiro: I think once the guild got a royal charter, it was technically illegal? Probably not enforced super well, but I'm sure it deterred most
[18/11/2022, 23:45:00] Alice Lafferty: Honestly trade unions were tending that way in the 80s. Weren't they literally violent towards those crossing picket lines in some cases?
[18/11/2022, 23:45:15] Alice Lafferty: Or is this misinformation from my Thatcherite father...
[18/11/2022, 23:45:16] Alex Regueiro: My school has a long-standing association with the Drapers' Company, going back to the founder who was a mercer I think.
[18/11/2022, 23:45:30] Alex Regueiro: I think that's true
[18/11/2022, 23:45:35] Alex Regueiro: Don't quote me on it though
[18/11/2022, 23:46:04] Alice Lafferty: Huh that's nice.
[18/11/2022, 23:47:14] Alex Regueiro: Remind me, which schools did you go to?
[18/11/2022, 23:47:36] Alex Regueiro: A girl's school in north London then St Albyn's for sixth form, I think?
[18/11/2022, 23:47:42] Alice Lafferty: North London Collegiate, then St Alban's (boys)
[18/11/2022, 23:48:15] Alice Lafferty: I forgot the name of yours!
[18/11/2022, 23:49:08] Alex Regueiro: My dad's a big fan of Thatcher too. I'm more mixed, but then I didn't live through it. I found the reaction to her death pretty from big parts of society sickening though. Do you find it easier to talk politics with your dad these days?
[18/11/2022, 23:49:15] Alex Regueiro: For shame!
[18/11/2022, 23:49:19] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I don't think I said it
[18/11/2022, 23:49:25] Alex Regueiro: But still, for shame
[18/11/2022, 23:49:28] Alex Regueiro: Bancroft's School
[18/11/2022, 23:49:58] Alice Lafferty: You definitely did, I recognise the name.
[18/11/2022, 23:50:33] Alice Lafferty: We have a special section of our bookshelf dedicated to Thatcher biographiesüòê
[18/11/2022, 23:50:51] Alex Regueiro: The architecture might look familiar, as the same guy designed one of the Victorian Cambridge colleges I think.
[18/11/2022, 23:51:35] Alex Regueiro: Haha brilliant.
[18/11/2022, 23:51:45] Alice Lafferty: I love talking about politics with him! He likes a good 'debate'
[18/11/2022, 23:51:58] Alice Lafferty: Oh? I'm going to look it up
[18/11/2022, 23:52:46] Alex Regueiro: I certainly admire her in part. The way she crushed the miners' union was impressive and that sort of response feels like it's in need of today with the RMT. All the same, deindustrialisation was maybe not the most far-sighted idea, and I'm not enthralled by some of her neoliberal policies.
[18/11/2022, 23:53:10] Alice Lafferty: I guess it kind of looks like Selwyn or Girton?
[18/11/2022, 23:53:18] Alex Regueiro: Yep, Selwyn, that's the one
[18/11/2022, 23:53:22] Alex Regueiro: same architect
[18/11/2022, 23:53:26] Alice Lafferty: She fascinates me.
[18/11/2022, 23:53:51] Alice Lafferty: 'The lady's not for turning' speech is riveting.
[18/11/2022, 23:53:58] Alex Regueiro: She was a force of nature whatever you think of her policies
[18/11/2022, 23:54:02] Alex Regueiro: (And a good Lincolnshire lass!)
[18/11/2022, 23:54:33] Alice Lafferty: I think that kind of libertarianism is admirable for its purity I guess..
[18/11/2022, 23:54:51] Alice Lafferty: But she also said 'there's no such thing as society'. This is a point I argue on with my dad all the time.
[18/11/2022, 23:55:32] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. So are some forms of socialism, I daresay... I don't think they're half as wonderful as the intentions though
[18/11/2022, 23:55:41] Alice Lafferty: The right are enthusiastic about economic growth and innovation, somehow without realising that this same innovation is what causes the erosion of traditions... lol
[18/11/2022, 23:55:45] Alex Regueiro: Yikes. Didn't know that
[18/11/2022, 23:56:05] Alex Regueiro: Reminds of a comment that Macron made a few years back
[18/11/2022, 23:56:44] Alex Regueiro: I also recently learnt that Thatcher was responsible for two really draconian anti-free-speech laws. Or at least they passed under her tenure. "Grossly offensive" communications being a crime and all that
[18/11/2022, 23:57:04] Alice Lafferty: Right. I forgot to ask you yesterday, did you trace Eleanor's Crosses when you were in the area?
[18/11/2022, 23:57:32] Alice Lafferty: Really? That's really surprising. Was it anti-communist?
[18/11/2022, 23:57:55] Alice Lafferty: Thank you for providing me with further ammunition against my dadüëå
[18/11/2022, 23:58:12] Alex Regueiro: Quite so. But some on the "right" are basically liberal purists who don't care a fig about tradition. It's funny because even Gladstone wasn't that way. How times have changed.
[18/11/2022, 23:58:53] Alex Regueiro: I didn't, I'm afraid. Just heard the history fairly recently, possibly while I was there?
[18/11/2022, 23:59:33] Alex Regueiro: Don't think so. One was the Malicious Communications Act 1988, and I forget the other, slightly earlier.
[18/11/2022, 23:59:47] Alice Lafferty: Yes true. I'm thinking of the traditional Shire Tories demographic (dying out now but still).
[19/11/2022, 00:00:02] Alice Lafferty: Who tend to hold these two convictions seemingly without seeing the contradiction.
[19/11/2022, 00:01:26] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I just looked it up. What? It's illegal to send messages with the intention of causing anxiety?
[19/11/2022, 00:02:06] Alice Lafferty: Literally unenforceable
[19/11/2022, 00:02:11] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much. Such a woolly definition (not far from the current Online Safety Bill), it's basically a nightmare for anyone who supports a liberal society.
[19/11/2022, 00:02:31] Alice Lafferty: One day I'd like to make a little road trip.
[19/11/2022, 00:02:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I know what you mean. I can forgive those who didn't see the contradiction 100 or even 50 years ago, but it couldn't be more apparent now.
[19/11/2022, 00:03:30] Alex Regueiro: That would be cool.
[19/11/2022, 00:03:39] Alex Regueiro: I think I might have seen the Grantham one actually? Just drove through.
[19/11/2022, 00:03:44] Alice Lafferty: I guess you've already seen Waltham Cross
[19/11/2022, 00:03:48] Alex Regueiro: Didn't see the one at Lincoln despite staying there
[19/11/2022, 00:04:51] Alice Lafferty: They route often puts you in the way of some cathedrals too.
[19/11/2022, 00:04:58] Alex Regueiro: They were for Eleanor of Castile, Edward I's wife, right?
[19/11/2022, 00:05:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[19/11/2022, 00:05:15] Alex Regueiro: Apparently one of the two genuine and faithful romances of English kings.
[19/11/2022, 00:05:31] Alice Lafferty: Yeah...
[19/11/2022, 00:05:33] Alex Regueiro: As in, the king really loved her, and didn't take any mistresses.
[19/11/2022, 00:05:38] Alex Regueiro: Henry VII was the other
[19/11/2022, 00:05:42] Alice Lafferty: The bar is very low isn't it.
[19/11/2022, 00:05:50] Alex Regueiro: Isn't very high you mean?!
[19/11/2022, 00:06:20] Alice Lafferty: Plus he could have just been more discrete than average.
[19/11/2022, 00:06:26] Alice Lafferty: Ha
[19/11/2022, 00:06:39] Alex Regueiro: There would have been rumours though. Lots of courtiers who would have known.
[19/11/2022, 00:06:44] Alex Regueiro: It seemed in fitting with his character
[19/11/2022, 00:06:52] Alice Lafferty: I think I used the wrong 'discreet' there
[19/11/2022, 00:07:07] Alex Regueiro: Longshanks's too. (Shame Braveheart makes him out to be such a devil, but it's part of the fun.)
[19/11/2022, 00:07:15] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. Easily mixed up
[19/11/2022, 00:07:39] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes.. meaning to watch that as well.
[19/11/2022, 00:07:42] Alex Regueiro: Especially if you're a mathematician / computer science, who almost always wants the 'discrete' variety
[19/11/2022, 00:07:45] Alex Regueiro: Thus I commend you
[19/11/2022, 00:08:42] Alice Lafferty: :)
[19/11/2022, 00:08:49] Alice Lafferty: Can we confirm everything for tomorrow.
[19/11/2022, 00:08:57] Alice Lafferty: *Or later on today
[19/11/2022, 00:09:33] Alex Regueiro: Mel Gibson is a bit crazy but I kind of like him. Apocalypto and the Passion of the Christ are also superb films, albeit a bit gory.
[19/11/2022, 00:09:59] Alex Regueiro: Yep, let's do that...
[19/11/2022, 00:10:18] Alex Regueiro: And I'm with you on "tomorrow". I refuse to clock over to the next day until I go to bed and wake up... whenever that may be!
[19/11/2022, 00:10:38] Alice Lafferty: I decide when the day begins, not the 'sun'.
[19/11/2022, 00:10:43] Alex Regueiro: 3:00pm at that car park in Epping Forest? Does that work for you? Feel free to move it a bit forward/backward if you need to.
[19/11/2022, 00:10:54] Alex Regueiro: Damn right
[19/11/2022, 00:10:59] Alex Regueiro: Bloody Copernicus
[19/11/2022, 00:11:01] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[19/11/2022, 00:11:02] Alex Regueiro: ruined everything
[19/11/2022, 00:11:27] Alice Lafferty: What was the name of the restaurant you recommended again?
[19/11/2022, 00:12:09] Alex Regueiro: Robin Hood Pub
[19/11/2022, 00:12:17] Alex Regueiro: You'd never guess it's a Thai restaurant, but it is
[19/11/2022, 00:12:17] Alice Lafferty: Ok, thanks.
[19/11/2022, 00:12:38] Alex Regueiro: It's got a lovely garden area, which we probably won't have the pleasure of experiencing.
[19/11/2022, 00:12:51] Alex Regueiro: I know, I'm the worst physicist ever
[19/11/2022, 00:12:56] Alice Lafferty: No üòÇ
[19/11/2022, 00:13:39] Alex Regueiro: How's your schedule at the moment - going to bed soon or not likely?
[19/11/2022, 00:13:59] Alice Lafferty: I don't know.
[19/11/2022, 00:14:08] Alice Lafferty: Today I woke up at 3pm.
[19/11/2022, 00:14:52] Alex Regueiro: Okay, so meeting at 3pm tomorrow sounds doable yeah?
[19/11/2022, 00:14:54] Alice Lafferty: So I'm not tired yet. üò¨ sorry it's kind of a gross slovenly way of living.
[19/11/2022, 00:15:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes should be fine.
[19/11/2022, 00:15:20] Alex Regueiro: Don't feel embarrassed. I've done the same. We both have the same or a very similar condition so we can commiserate together!
[19/11/2022, 00:15:36] Alex Regueiro: What you need is a cushy part-time job like me where it doesn't matter so much. (Even if it's still nice to get up in the morning.)
[19/11/2022, 00:15:40] Alice Lafferty: What kind of hours are you on?
[19/11/2022, 00:15:46] Alice Lafferty: I know!
[19/11/2022, 00:15:56] Alex Regueiro: They vary quite a bit. 1pm today?
[19/11/2022, 00:16:16] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Not too bad.
[19/11/2022, 00:16:34] Alex Regueiro: I know it's not healthy, but my body has been playing this cruel game on me for years now.
[19/11/2022, 00:16:48] Alex Regueiro: Did your condition come about in your teens too?
[19/11/2022, 00:17:09] Alex Regueiro: I think it became full blown by about 20
[19/11/2022, 00:17:26] Alice Lafferty: Me too! I try not to think about the health effects.
[19/11/2022, 00:17:29] Alice Lafferty: https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-022-01238-y
[19/11/2022, 00:17:43] Alice Lafferty: Yes me too.
[19/11/2022, 00:18:15] Alice Lafferty: It's partly because my days are so unstructured without school or work.
[19/11/2022, 00:18:25] Alex Regueiro: Still better than getting 4 hours a night like our dear late Iron Lady though...
[19/11/2022, 00:19:03] Alex Regueiro: If we're lucky we'll have really effective cancer treatments by the time we're old. üôÇ
[19/11/2022, 00:19:14] Alex Regueiro: Interesting though.
[19/11/2022, 00:19:25] Alex Regueiro: I get that, yep
[19/11/2022, 00:19:42] Alice Lafferty: Maybe, the quantity vs quality distinction is important?
[19/11/2022, 00:20:18] Alex Regueiro: Both are pretty important I understand. I keep hearing it's very unhealthy for anyone whatsoever to operate on < 6.5 or 7 hours a night. An adult.
[19/11/2022, 00:20:32] Alex Regueiro: But I need 8 or 8.5 to operate well, I think
[19/11/2022, 00:20:42] Alex Regueiro: There's a lot of natural variation
[19/11/2022, 00:21:42] Alice Lafferty: Me too. By the way is the spanish word for eat really 'comer'?
[19/11/2022, 00:22:02] Alex Regueiro: That's so non-sequitur hah.
[19/11/2022, 00:22:08] Alice Lafferty: Is that from 'cosumere'
[19/11/2022, 00:22:09] Alex Regueiro: Yes it is
[19/11/2022, 00:22:25] Alex Regueiro: comm-AIR, roughly
[19/11/2022, 00:22:44] Alex Regueiro: Why do you say 'really'? I can guess but...
[19/11/2022, 00:22:44] Alice Lafferty: I know, I was trying to say in Spanish 'I am going to get something to eat'.
[19/11/2022, 00:22:57] Alice Lafferty: I was expecting it to be some form of mangere, mangiare
[19/11/2022, 00:23:07] Alex Regueiro: Not sure, and I'm embarrassed because I love etymology. But sounds plausible.
[19/11/2022, 00:23:43] Alex Regueiro: So, I know manger/mangiare is some corruption of masticare (to chew), and very much not Classical Latin
[19/11/2022, 00:24:20] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[19/11/2022, 00:24:31] Alice Lafferty: Spanish diverged.
[19/11/2022, 00:24:46] Alex Regueiro: Just thinking, 'comer' might be from con + edere, where 'edere' is the Classical Latin for to eat.
[19/11/2022, 00:24:58] Alice Lafferty: In any case je vais get something a comer. Franglaispagnol....
[19/11/2022, 00:25:29] Alice Lafferty: üëå
[19/11/2022, 00:25:54] Alex Regueiro: Seems it is! https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comedo#Latin
[19/11/2022, 00:25:59] Alice Lafferty: Good point. Oh, apparently 'comedo' already exists in the latin
[19/11/2022, 00:26:23] Alex Regueiro: So in this case Italian/French diverged more. It's hit and miss as to whether Italian or Spanish is closer to Classical Latin really. Usually Italian I think, but not sure.
[19/11/2022, 00:26:42] Alex Regueiro: Haha top notch.
[19/11/2022, 00:26:58] Alex Regueiro: O mejor say, very bien
[19/11/2022, 00:27:03] Alice Lafferty: Certainly Italian?
[19/11/2022, 00:27:25] Alex Regueiro: I could talk for a while about this actually... and bore you utterly to sleep.
[19/11/2022, 00:27:32] Alice Lafferty: Hasta la vista, au revoir, toodaloo pip
[19/11/2022, 00:27:32] Alex Regueiro: Which maybe you want!
[19/11/2022, 00:28:41] Alex Regueiro: I love old-fashioned English slang like that
[19/11/2022, 00:28:48] Alex Regueiro: It's such arrant gibberish really
[19/11/2022, 00:28:49] Alice Lafferty: Superficially Italian seems more similar. Maybe at the grammatical level it's otherwise
[19/11/2022, 00:29:58] Alice Lafferty: Same! But did you know use of old-fashioned words is explicitly picked out in autism screenings.
[19/11/2022, 00:30:53] Alex Regueiro: So in brief, Italian retained the long and short vowels, and an intonation closer to classical Latin. Also Italian developed some vulgarisms that Spanish didn't, like the pronunciation of the s, the vocalisation of s into z... But in terms of vocabulary, some areas of it Spanish retained conservatively and others Italian.
[19/11/2022, 00:31:02] Alex Regueiro: That's really interesting
[19/11/2022, 00:31:04] Alice Lafferty: Which I think is again a good example of diagnostic overreach.
[19/11/2022, 00:31:07] Alex Regueiro: Did you use any in your screening?
[19/11/2022, 00:31:11] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, seems a bit extreme
[19/11/2022, 00:31:27] Alex Regueiro: What if you just have an affinity for everything archaic? Or an expansive vocabulary?
[19/11/2022, 00:31:34] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I didn't know any of this.
[19/11/2022, 00:32:33] Alice Lafferty: Exactly? I think it's supposed to encompass like their inappropriate insertion into speech, stereotypy.
[19/11/2022, 00:33:08] Alice Lafferty: It was part of a checklist which my mum was given to fill out. She said it about me :(
[19/11/2022, 00:34:15] Alex Regueiro: So an obvious one where Spanish is more conservative is "ir" from Latin "ire" (to go), whereas Italian adopted "andare" (to walk) for that infinitive
[19/11/2022, 00:34:23] Alice Lafferty: I'm trying to find my report now haha
[19/11/2022, 00:34:50] Alex Regueiro: Uh oh. I may be guilty too. Every so often I think I use an old fashioned word and someone will ask me what it means.
[19/11/2022, 00:35:00] Alex Regueiro: I'd be very curious
[19/11/2022, 00:36:10] Alice Lafferty: The essere verb in italian always seemd to conjugate very similarly to latin.
[19/11/2022, 00:36:21] Alice Lafferty: But I'm not familiar at all with spanish so not in a good place to compare them.
[19/11/2022, 00:37:47] Alice Lafferty: Honestly it makes for very sad reading really.
[19/11/2022, 00:38:16] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it does, though it's very similar in Spanish
[19/11/2022, 00:38:33] Alex Regueiro: French is a bit more deviant. As in most things!
[19/11/2022, 00:38:49] Alex Regueiro: But you studied a bit of Italian?
[19/11/2022, 00:39:01] Alice Lafferty: !
[19/11/2022, 00:39:56] Alice Lafferty: For like 2 years. Not even to GCSE. It's pretty and v easy if you already know some french.
[19/11/2022, 00:40:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah true. French isn't too hard I think, except for the pronunciation to some extent, and the huge number of weird idioms that seem essential to everyday speech.
[19/11/2022, 00:41:07] Alice Lafferty: I really like this spanish practice: ! ¬°
[19/11/2022, 00:41:17] Alex Regueiro: I was trying to find this or another similar one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3guklJefcQ
[19/11/2022, 00:41:22] Alice Lafferty: I think it would be really useful in english.
[19/11/2022, 00:41:31] Alex Regueiro: Blackadder takes the piss out of it quite regularly üôÇ
[19/11/2022, 00:41:53] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Sadly it's becoming less common in contemporary Spanish.
[19/11/2022, 00:42:09] Alex Regueiro: They use ¬ø ? too
[19/11/2022, 00:42:17] Alice Lafferty: Yes, it's like a Wodehouse parody.
[19/11/2022, 00:42:48] Alex Regueiro: Or this one, even better!
[19/11/2022, 00:42:49] Alex Regueiro: https://youtu.be/ejc1wwRGjFk?t=86
[19/11/2022, 00:42:54] Alice Lafferty: Really, I didn't know that. Do the spanish have an equivalent to the academie francaise?
[19/11/2022, 00:43:01] Alex Regueiro: Yes exactly. Never read him, but I've heard that once before
[19/11/2022, 00:43:27] Alice Lafferty: I love how they pronounce 'orf'
[19/11/2022, 00:43:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, the Real Academia Espa√±olla
[19/11/2022, 00:43:56] Alice Lafferty: Actually really funny. Good in small doses.
[19/11/2022, 00:44:13] Alice Lafferty: But they're not as stringent as the French.
[19/11/2022, 00:44:16] Alex Regueiro: I sometimes lament that English doesn't have one...
[19/11/2022, 00:44:29] Alex Regueiro: Oh no, they're very stringent. Just everyday practice often differs
[19/11/2022, 00:44:39] Alex Regueiro: Hmm?
[19/11/2022, 00:44:56] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, in this video
[19/11/2022, 00:47:39] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes hah
[19/11/2022, 00:47:56] Alex Regueiro: That old posh accent was great, in some ways
[19/11/2022, 00:48:14] Alex Regueiro: Incredible how rapidly it's evolved. The Queen was a good example of it even.
[19/11/2022, 00:51:26] Alex Regueiro: Alors, qu'est-ce que tu manges?
[19/11/2022, 08:59:41] Alice Lafferty: Hello, I've been thinking a bit as our date approaches... I'm not entirely sure if I want to pursue a romantic relationship (with anyone, it's nothing personal). As you've probably noticed, I'm a bit scattered at the moment. I think we should remain friends instead.
[19/11/2022, 09:00:34] Alice Lafferty: Hopefully you're not put out by this.
[19/11/2022, 09:02:48] Alice Lafferty: A relationship may just not be on the cards for me, and I regret trying to force one to happen. For what it's worth, I think you could do better than me anyway.
[19/11/2022, 12:59:35] Alex Regueiro: Okay. I won‚Äôt pretend I‚Äôm not a bit disappointed though.
[19/11/2022, 12:59:57] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll try to accept it.
[19/11/2022, 13:00:31] Alex Regueiro: Are we still good to meet in a bit though?
[19/11/2022, 13:24:54] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôve got things to do until then so I may not check my phone, but I‚Äôll be there at 3.
[19/11/2022, 14:30:23] Alice Lafferty: I'm sorry to have disappointed you.
[19/11/2022, 14:30:46] Alice Lafferty: Maybe let's leave it today?
[19/11/2022, 14:43:04] Alex Regueiro: I just left‚Ä¶
[19/11/2022, 14:43:08] Alex Regueiro: Are you sure?
[19/11/2022, 14:45:51] Alex Regueiro: I can‚Äôt figure out if you‚Äôre just sugar-coating it and you simply can‚Äôt think of me as anything other than a friend at most, or you‚Äôre just really lacking in confidence and doubting yourself too much. ü§î
[19/11/2022, 14:47:56] Alex Regueiro: ‚Ä¶or if it‚Äôs just anxiety speaking
[19/11/2022, 14:49:39] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôm heading back now since you won‚Äôt be on time in any case, but please let me know what your thinking either way.
[19/11/2022, 15:00:36] Alex Regueiro: Can I call you?
[19/11/2022, 16:42:01] Alice Lafferty: Sorry (again) for the short notice!
[19/11/2022, 16:42:32] Alice Lafferty: We can speak on the phone this evening if you like?
[19/11/2022, 17:17:59] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I think that would be helpful however we go forwards
[19/11/2022, 17:18:04] Alex Regueiro: Thanks
[19/11/2022, 17:18:08] Alex Regueiro: Let me know when you're free later
[19/11/2022, 19:01:49] Alice Lafferty: Can probably talk anytime after 7:30pm!
[19/11/2022, 19:09:22] Alex Regueiro: Okay, sure
[19/11/2022, 19:32:55] Alice Lafferty: I just tried calling
[19/11/2022, 20:28:33] Alex Regueiro: Thank you again for making everything so clear and putting up with my clumsy attempts to express my thoughts! You're a really intelligent and conscientious woman, so I'm sure it will just be a matter of time before you get your life in great order and put your concerns to rest. At least, as much as any earthly being can! Take care in the meanwhile. üôÇ
[19/11/2022, 22:21:51] Alice Lafferty: You weren't clumsy at all - I didn't conduct things very well. I'm very grateful to you for being so understanding! All the best anyway x
[19/11/2022, 22:24:07] Alex Regueiro: No worries. It's all a learning experience, right? Enjoy your Sunday.
[19/11/2022, 22:25:06] Alex Regueiro: And I'll let you know at some point if there's a concert you might like or a spot on my pub quiz team! We can just go as friends. x
[19/11/2022, 22:25:40] Alice Lafferty: Ok thanks, I'd really like that.
[24/11/2022, 18:05:10] Alex Regueiro: Hey Alice. How are you doing?
[24/11/2022, 18:05:19] Alex Regueiro: I couldn't help but think you would have enjoyed the yesterday evening's salon... We spent half of it laughing at the style of Jordan Peterson's piece on climate change, not to mention the single he just dropped! (Warning: it's a little creepy.)
[24/11/2022, 20:29:47] Alice Lafferty: Haha WHAT
[24/11/2022, 20:29:58] Alice Lafferty: You mean he made music?
[24/11/2022, 20:31:56] Alice Lafferty: *hello by the way. I'm doing ok thanks, how are you?
[24/11/2022, 20:36:06] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, surprised me too! https://youtu.be/P1po9pNs8RU
[24/11/2022, 20:37:50] Alex Regueiro: Glad to hear. Starting to "clean up your room" as JP would put it?
[24/11/2022, 20:38:14] Alex Regueiro: I'm alright apart from catching a cold yesterday, thanks
[24/11/2022, 23:28:28] Alex Regueiro: https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/fifa-has-scored-a-spectacular-own-goal/
[24/11/2022, 23:28:42] Alex Regueiro: Here's another gem you might like... on that note, good night!
[25/11/2022, 19:00:18] Alice Lafferty: What the hell, I can't believe I missed this.
‚Äé[25/11/2022, 19:02:16] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[25/11/2022, 19:02:30] Alice Lafferty: What are the 'maps of meaning' here.
[25/11/2022, 19:05:28] Alice Lafferty: It reminds me of a lot of one-pentecostalist rock music, also surely the comment section is doctored?
[25/11/2022, 19:06:33] Alice Lafferty: Apparently if you suffer more than two colds per year that indicates your immune system is somewhat compromised.
[25/11/2022, 19:08:00] Alice Lafferty: Haha. I admit I'm watching the England game now with my family.
[25/11/2022, 19:53:03] Alex Regueiro: I have no idea...
[25/11/2022, 19:53:12] Alex Regueiro: Well, maybe corruption of the youth or something?
[25/11/2022, 19:53:23] Alex Regueiro: Haha, have you actually read it, or part?
[25/11/2022, 19:53:47] Alex Regueiro: I probably average two. My sister on the other hand...
[25/11/2022, 19:54:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I'm watching too. Turned it on late, but I hear it's more like the England we "know and love"!
[25/11/2022, 19:55:11] Alex Regueiro: Murray can be wonderfully caustic sometimes.
[25/11/2022, 21:37:10] Alice Lafferty: I think I started reading a pdf of it but dropped it.
[25/11/2022, 21:37:22] Alice Lafferty: You mean better or worse?
[25/11/2022, 21:39:34] Alice Lafferty: Seems so. I wouldn't be able to tell, but my dad was muttering very darkly the whole way through üëé
[25/11/2022, 21:39:54] Alex Regueiro: Can't blame you. You'd have to be a bit of a masochist...
[25/11/2022, 21:40:17] Alex Regueiro: Worse. She has had immune problems her whole life, of some sort
[25/11/2022, 21:40:36] Alice Lafferty: What was the topic for your meeting that Jordan Peterson got brought up?
[25/11/2022, 21:41:03] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Though part of me can't help but thank it's karma for all the performative activism and virtue signalling coming from the England team/manager & the FA!
[25/11/2022, 21:41:08] Alex Regueiro: Environmentalism
[25/11/2022, 21:42:09] Alice Lafferty: I'm sorry to hear that. I guess she's tried every drug/therapy/ elimination diet etc under the sun.
[25/11/2022, 21:42:46] Alex Regueiro: Actually no. Thankfully she got over her psoriasis years ago, these day it mainly manifests as getting ill a great deal.
[25/11/2022, 21:43:22] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. Out of interest did you happen to have any actual earth scientists in your group?
[25/11/2022, 21:43:25] Alex Regueiro: She probably should try something more... but she lives with it.
[25/11/2022, 21:44:01] Alex Regueiro: Afraid not. The closest was probably me who took a module on climate science in my undergrad!
[25/11/2022, 21:44:12] Alex Regueiro: (It was the doss option, and I needed one)
[25/11/2022, 21:44:26] Alice Lafferty: Someone from the field could probably contribute a great deal to the discussion, esp where dispute over facts rather than values are concerned.
[25/11/2022, 21:45:05] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. We kind of took it for granted that it's true at least to some extent though, and debated more the sociopolitical aspects.
[25/11/2022, 21:45:47] Alice Lafferty: Maybe it's too pat to say these things are caused by diet or lifestyle. It's probably much more complex.
[25/11/2022, 21:46:16] Alex Regueiro: Peterson reader his diatribe (Telegraph article) on his Youtube channel, if you want to listen... Or better, there's a nice response from Mallen Baker that deals with it point by point.
[25/11/2022, 21:46:39] Alice Lafferty: But doesn't the political action we should take depend very much on precisely which model we use... they differ slightly in timeframe I think.
[25/11/2022, 21:46:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's mainly just congenital, from my dad's mum's side. Thankfully I got off very lightly.
[25/11/2022, 21:47:27] Alex Regueiro: It definitely does... though we did stipulate the different forecasts to some extent.
[25/11/2022, 21:47:58] Alice Lafferty: What's his opinion briefly?
[25/11/2022, 21:48:55] Alice Lafferty: I think I've only ever seen him give 'well, what is the climate anyway...' kind of non-answers.
[25/11/2022, 21:49:06] Alex Regueiro: Blah blah libertarian stuff blah don't tread one me blah blah you can screw your own standard of living if you want but I'm going to enjoy riding my fancy SUV.
[25/11/2022, 21:49:28] Alex Regueiro: Slightly weirdly decide to attack Deloitte for a report they released
[25/11/2022, 21:49:38] Alex Regueiro: Instead of the genuine "eco-authoritarians" in the EU/UN and whatnot.
[25/11/2022, 21:49:49] Alex Regueiro: decided*
[25/11/2022, 21:50:36] Alice Lafferty: I would guess he himself believes in anthropogenic CC but is constrained the 'contrarian' image he has to uphold.
[25/11/2022, 21:51:17] Alice Lafferty: He's like a libertarian for everything except sex.
[25/11/2022, 21:52:38] Alex Regueiro: You'd hope so. I think he's admitted to it to some extent elsewhere. He maybe downplays it too much, though I can at least agree with his rants against the doomsdayers and fanatical protesters.
[25/11/2022, 21:52:52] Alex Regueiro: Haha, pretty much.
[25/11/2022, 21:53:09] Alex Regueiro: Wait, do you mean sex as in the biological category, or the act?
[25/11/2022, 21:53:42] Alice Lafferty: 'We should enforce [order/monogamy/gender roles] because they have good outcomes for the whole group'. Imagine applying that principle elsewhere...
[25/11/2022, 21:54:28] Alice Lafferty: Act
[25/11/2022, 21:54:34] Alex Regueiro: The same guy who critiqued Peterson's rant has a nice little ~8 min segment on the World Cup, in case you're curious. (Don't read too much into the clickbaity title.) https://youtu.be/807F3CF27Xs?t=760
[25/11/2022, 21:55:11] Alice Lafferty: Thanks I will look.
[25/11/2022, 21:56:07] Alex Regueiro: That's quite a neoconservative line yes. I still endorse it to some extent. If you substitute "enforce" for "promote", i.e., create a social/legal structure that rewards monogamy and fidelity and makes the opposite socially disadvantageous (not talking about jail or anything though).
[25/11/2022, 21:56:18] Alex Regueiro: Gender roles he's too old-fashioned on though, probably
[25/11/2022, 21:56:32] Alex Regueiro: He has to accept that these things evolve over time, and can afford to be more flexible nowadays
[25/11/2022, 21:56:50] Alice Lafferty: Right, so why shouldn't we say the same about collective or even legal action against climate change?
[25/11/2022, 21:57:11] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely we should
[25/11/2022, 21:58:26] Alice Lafferty: Lots of people don't seem to admit to this.
[25/11/2022, 21:59:31] Alex Regueiro: It's just that actions like paying third world / developing countries not to develop, not to use fossil fuels, etc. is going to backfire spectacularly. Near-sighted solution that can only harm us and them long term. Better to put only moderate constraints on developing countries, more stringent ones on first world countries, and help them get a good standard of living because that's proven to make people more environmentally conscious and not so worried about making little sacrifices. This is more or less the Shellenberger line, I think.
[25/11/2022, 22:00:35] Alice Lafferty: It's similar to how he more generally uses evo psych to justify hierarchies he likes, whereas hierarchies he doesn't like must be the result of subversion by 'postmodern neomarxists' or whatever
[25/11/2022, 22:01:04] Alex Regueiro: Also, the huge hypocrisy of elites when it comes to environmentalism and climate change rightly rankles the lower classes. It's a classic 'luxury belief' for them (they may still genuinely believe it), but high energy prices, carbon tax, etc. effects them much less. And they can more than offset that in terms of social kudos they gain.
[25/11/2022, 22:01:14] Alice Lafferty: I agree. As far as I can most climate activists put the blame and brunt of responsibility squarely on 'the west' ?
[25/11/2022, 22:01:45] Alice Lafferty: Is there any real movement to try to hamper the industrialisation of eg. India? If so, I haven't seen it.
[25/11/2022, 22:02:14] Alex Regueiro: They do, though they blissfully ignore China's role (and a few other countries) and usually also insist that developing countries should pay the price of our sins. Sort of a weird flipside to the colonial legacy / reparations argument.
[25/11/2022, 22:02:30] Alice Lafferty: India and China are absolutely full speed ahead with coal and gas.
[25/11/2022, 22:02:44] Alex Regueiro: Significant. We and the US and other developed nations have already paid a lot of money to such developing countries not to create coal plants, etc.
[25/11/2022, 22:02:52] Alice Lafferty: I've never seen them blame developing countries.
[25/11/2022, 22:03:01] Alice Lafferty: Besides India is still a developing country.
[25/11/2022, 22:03:16] Alex Regueiro: At the same time, at least China is investing a lot in renewables now. They're kind of bipolar on it all now.
[25/11/2022, 22:04:00] Alice Lafferty: They are much better position to build and actually benefit off of nuclear I guess.
[25/11/2022, 22:04:00] Alex Regueiro: It's not so much blame as precluding / strongly disincentivising them from developing.
[25/11/2022, 22:04:33] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Other renewables too, of course, but certainly nuclear is a big one for them. (They invest a lot in fusion research these days too.)
[25/11/2022, 22:04:40] Alice Lafferty: I haven't seen this in public discussion, it must be in the small print.
[25/11/2022, 22:04:59] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's naturally not something our governments or their media lackeys like to big up!
[25/11/2022, 22:05:18] Alex Regueiro: But there's lots of evidence, if you search for it
[25/11/2022, 22:05:33] Alice Lafferty: Most of what I see is net-zero targets for Western nations. And some kind of vague nod towards 'justice' for the Global South.
[25/11/2022, 22:06:08] Alex Regueiro: The irony is that they frame this as benefitting the poor equatorial countries, though some of their policies actively harm them.
[25/11/2022, 22:06:48] Alice Lafferty: Why not invest dollars in building renewable energy infrastructure in Africa.
[25/11/2022, 22:06:52] Alex Regueiro: The sensible thing to do would be to allow fossil fuels and the growth they generate in poorer/smaller nations with a clear plan for how to transition as they grow. Or indeed invest now.
[25/11/2022, 22:07:21] Alice Lafferty: Seems to kill two birds with one stone, instead of filling the 'foreign aid' black hole.
[25/11/2022, 22:07:38] Alex Regueiro: Right, that would be sensible, but I think a) they're wary of claims of neocolonialism, b) they're more concerned about their own image than actually doing anything (yes, I'm a cynic)
[25/11/2022, 22:08:16] Alice Lafferty: Can we actually afford the doubling or tripling of carbon emissions industrialising Africa would entail.
[25/11/2022, 22:08:33] Alice Lafferty: Heh, China will do it then.
[25/11/2022, 22:08:38] Alice Lafferty: *is already doing it
[25/11/2022, 22:09:11] Alice Lafferty: Monopolise Africa's natural resources and bring the world's fastest growing population neatly under Chinese sphere of influence.
[25/11/2022, 22:09:32] Alex Regueiro: It wouldn't mean anything like that, especially if the West decreases at the same time. They're such small emitters, and will continue to be for some time. If you try to stop them using fossil fuels entirely, you'll just create enormous resentment. You trade one "emergency" (climate) for another (political and economic intability)
[25/11/2022, 22:09:35] Alex Regueiro: instability*
[25/11/2022, 22:10:05] Alex Regueiro: Yep. That's true neocolonialism. It's kind of scary how it mimics the growth of the British Empire in some fundamental ways. The West is not combatting that nearly enough.
[25/11/2022, 22:10:13] Alice Lafferty: I actually think 'building hydrolectric dams in Ethiopia!' would be a great splash for western environmentalists and assorted luvvies.
[25/11/2022, 22:11:00] Alex Regueiro: It probably would, but it takes lots of effort! And like I said, these are sort of zero-cost beliefs for haute bourgeois virtue signalling types, in many (not all) cases.
[25/11/2022, 22:11:24] Alice Lafferty: To obtain Western standards of living for 1-2 billion people would ok, not double, but significantly increase emissions.
[25/11/2022, 22:11:50] Alice Lafferty: Or even 3 if you count other parts of SE Asia and C America.
[25/11/2022, 22:12:41] Alice Lafferty: I don't really see what we can doc to be honest
[25/11/2022, 22:13:14] Alex Regueiro: But they're so far off that right now, it's not a concern at all if you help them set out a proper plan of growth and transitioning. They can use some renewables from the start, I'm just saying it's arrogant and authoritarian to impose too much on them, to deny them the growth we enjoyed without consequences.
[25/11/2022, 22:13:43] Alex Regueiro: And leading by example and/or investing in their countries is a much better way to progress than just paying them not to develop (effectively)!
[25/11/2022, 22:14:02] Alice Lafferty: But we could support them in ecomonic growth fuelled by renewables?
[25/11/2022, 22:14:05] Alex Regueiro: It may be too late now. Mind you, there's big growing resentment against the Chinese in Africa and parts of South America. No surprise really.
[25/11/2022, 22:14:46] Alex Regueiro: Entirely? No. It's simply not feasible. They'd have to accept very slow growth and the ingression of lots of Western companies who have the expertise. (Fossil fuels requires much less expertise.)
[25/11/2022, 22:14:58] Alice Lafferty: Apparently the Chinese ship their own workers into African mines etc, stripping the land and not employing the locals.
[25/11/2022, 22:15:54] Alex Regueiro: To be honest, part of me thinks we should promote our own "benign" brand of neocolonialism, that works with and to the benefit of the host nations at much as possible. But calling that unfashionable is an understatement. We're far too busy self-flagellating over our history.
[25/11/2022, 22:16:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's frankly both a human and ecological nightmare that doesn't get nearly enough attention.
[25/11/2022, 22:16:43] Alice Lafferty: Honestly they seem to be doing very well at 'not using fossil fuels effectively' even without Western sanctions lol...
[25/11/2022, 22:17:44] Alex Regueiro: Yes hah. Just because they're doing a poor job of developing in general. Most of the money we pump into them line the pockets of a few very filthy rich leaders and corrupt officials.
[25/11/2022, 22:18:06] Alice Lafferty: A lot of the left are (understandably) burnt by past US military intervention in the global south and have an automatic negative response to suggestions like that. But I kind of agree with you.
[25/11/2022, 22:18:13] Alex Regueiro: Have you read "The Case for Colonialism", incidentally? It generated a lot of controversy when it came out, and though it's maybe a bit lopsided the other way, it actually has some really good points.
[25/11/2022, 22:18:54] Alex Regueiro: Yup, it's only fair they're wary... they think at best they'll become banana republics ruled by Monsanto again. But in theory it could work, right?
[25/11/2022, 22:19:50] Alice Lafferty: So if they're basically not developing anyway, I don't see how guiding them towards or even funding their renewables really constitutes an injustice. P
[25/11/2022, 22:20:35] Alice Lafferty: I haven't haha. Kind of book you would get dirty looks for reading on the Tube.
[25/11/2022, 22:20:42] Alex Regueiro: It depends which example you pick out. India and Brazil are maybe exceptions?
[25/11/2022, 22:21:00] Alex Regueiro: But I agree it's not really an injustice to go in and help them develop renewables.
[25/11/2022, 22:21:37] Alice Lafferty: India's doing pretty well it seems? Just absolutely guzzling coal but in no place to judge.
[25/11/2022, 22:21:41] Alex Regueiro: Alas, we're not doing much of that right now, and not enough proposals talk about it. Plus, I just think we should allow them to use fossil at moderate level that we know won't screw things.
[25/11/2022, 22:22:03] Alice Lafferty: People have been predicting Brazil will become a major economy in the next 10 years for at least 40 years.
[25/11/2022, 22:22:17] Alice Lafferty: It's like driverless cars.
[25/11/2022, 22:22:19] Alex Regueiro: I think so. Very hard to work with them right now, since Modi is a nasty sort of nationalist, and not very friendly to the West as a whole.
[25/11/2022, 22:22:28] Alex Regueiro: Or fusion
[25/11/2022, 22:22:28] Alex Regueiro: yeah
[25/11/2022, 22:22:29] Alex Regueiro: ha
[25/11/2022, 22:22:48] Alex Regueiro: Who knows if it will happen, I agree... I just mean they're one of the bigger developing economies.
[25/11/2022, 22:22:58] Alex Regueiro: All the more fun, no?!
[25/11/2022, 22:23:14] Alex Regueiro: It's just an academic paper though. Relatively short.
[25/11/2022, 22:23:31] Alice Lafferty: You think? Maybe it's like the England team... 'next year will be our year... '
[25/11/2022, 22:23:34] Alex Regueiro: Got predictably rescinded. But published by another small journal.
[25/11/2022, 22:23:58] Alice Lafferty: All of this stuff works in theory.
[25/11/2022, 22:24:21] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see, I'll look it up.
[25/11/2022, 22:24:24] Alex Regueiro: The true question of our times: Who's more deluded, England fans or utopian socialists?
[25/11/2022, 22:25:04] Alex Regueiro: I think it could work in practice too, but not in the current cultural or political climate in the Western. Some day, let's hope.
[25/11/2022, 22:25:13] Alice Lafferty: I did read a very pro-colonialism popular history book on the British Empire (Niall Ferguson? but don't quote me on that).
[25/11/2022, 22:25:42] Alice Lafferty: Am familiar with some of the arguments.
[25/11/2022, 22:25:44] Alex Regueiro: That rings a bell yep
[25/11/2022, 22:26:22] Alex Regueiro: https://www.nas.org/academic-questions/31/2/the_case_for_colonialism
[25/11/2022, 22:26:32] Alice Lafferty: I'm moved esp by the idea that belonging to a certain ethnicity does not make you particularly entitled to rule over others of that ethnicity.
[25/11/2022, 22:27:17] Alice Lafferty: I'm also more inclined to disregard cultural factors, at least more so than you are maybe!
[25/11/2022, 22:27:27] Alice Lafferty: It's as simple as 'follow the money'.
[25/11/2022, 22:28:18] Alice Lafferty: Indians are actually inveigling themselves into invaluable positions in US and Western tech and politics...
[25/11/2022, 22:28:26] Alex Regueiro: Right, that's a big implicit argument against colonialism of whatever sort but... does it actually hold much water? I can accept that if you're genuinely in and feel you're in the same boat as the people you rule over, that is liable to make for a far more benign ruler... but there are so many caveats.
[25/11/2022, 22:28:40] Alice Lafferty: Huge ascendancy of esp Brahmin families.
[25/11/2022, 22:28:54] Alex Regueiro: Yep. They probably once again rule Twitter, since Musk took over!

[25/11/2022, 22:29:48] Alice Lafferty: Why is it better for an ethnically Indian tyrant to rule over India than an ethnically Greek tyrant. If both enact equally deleterious policies.
[25/11/2022, 22:30:21] Alice Lafferty: Those pictures aren't real before and after pictures though obviously.
[25/11/2022, 22:30:38] Alex Regueiro: I'd expect as much. But I don't think even you can say it's advisable for any Western politician to adopt that tack right now. It's kind of political suicide, even when promoted super judiciously.
[25/11/2022, 22:30:51] Alice Lafferty: They're obviously just pictures of different departments.
[25/11/2022, 22:31:08] Alex Regueiro: No, but they are both Twitter office pics, and there has been a massive culture and workforce shift with Musk!
[25/11/2022, 22:31:44] Alice Lafferty: It seems he no longer pays lip service to diversity etc yes
[25/11/2022, 22:32:23] Alex Regueiro: It's certainly no better. Though I will grant the probability that a randomly selected Indian rules over India well vs. a randomly selected Greek is a favourable.
[25/11/2022, 22:32:40] Alex Regueiro: Except Alexander the Great. He rocks, for obvious reasons. üôÇ
[25/11/2022, 22:32:51] Alice Lafferty: I think this is not born out by history at all.
[25/11/2022, 22:33:09] Alex Regueiro: He doesn't. It's more of a pure capitalist meritocracy now. Which may have its own problems, but DEI bullshit is not one...
[25/11/2022, 22:34:20] Alice Lafferty: Romans ruled quite fairly over most of the empire outside the imperial core.
[25/11/2022, 22:34:20] Alex Regueiro: I don't know of any historical surveys (would be really hard to do), but I'd say that foreign rulers have a much more extreme effect on the wellbeing of conquered foreign lands. More extreme than national rulers.
[25/11/2022, 22:34:50] Alex Regueiro: Part of it may just be the inbuilt tendency of humans to fear outgroups... which makes it difficult. And whether or not that's rational, you have to account for it.
[25/11/2022, 22:35:02] Alice Lafferty: Is this because of the rulers themselves or just shock of regime change/invasion?
[25/11/2022, 22:35:04] Alex Regueiro: They did. I had that in mind actually. üôÇ
[25/11/2022, 22:35:38] Alex Regueiro: Just the Jews and a few others got all indignant about having to pay homage to Caesar and pseudo-worship him!
[25/11/2022, 22:36:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes. And tbf they did have their temple destroyed.
[25/11/2022, 22:36:44] Alice Lafferty: But Roman Empire was basically religiously pluralistic, up until the very end.
[25/11/2022, 22:37:13] Alex Regueiro: I'd say it's only natural that foreign rulers are likelier not to mind plundering a country's wealth without a care for the native people. But there are certainly plenty of counterexamples too. This is sort of the "colonial mindset" (in the pejorative sense) versus the conqueror's mindset. The latter tends to invest more in the country, and the wellbeing of its populace is integral to success.
[25/11/2022, 22:37:27] Alex Regueiro: Until the mid 300s yep. So, almost.
[25/11/2022, 22:37:43] Alice Lafferty: Yes but people are outgrouped even intra-ethnically. The caste system is a good example.
[25/11/2022, 22:38:55] Alex Regueiro: Only after a massive revolt where lots of Romans were killed. I'm not taking sides here, but the Romans' harsh response was sort of predictable by anyone! Their policy was always like "we're going to be nice to you, integrate you properly into the Empire and invest in you, so long as you accept us as overlords and don't stir up trouble... if you do that, we're going to let loose on you!"
[25/11/2022, 22:39:38] Alice Lafferty: The argument here is that the British introduced parliamentary government to India, and built railways or whatever there.
[25/11/2022, 22:39:41] Alex Regueiro: Yep. It's a big criticism of late capitalism, that elites in the West are drawing away from their average 'fellow' citizen not only economically but also socioculturally. There's plenty of support for this empirically too.
[25/11/2022, 22:40:38] Alex Regueiro: And outlawed the practice of sati and a few other barbaric things. And eliminated the thuggees. And gave them a unifying language, you could say. But anyway, I'd considered these all legitimate benefits we brought to them whilst not denying the great wrongs we did them.
[25/11/2022, 22:41:19] Alex Regueiro: Reminds me though, the British were guilty of exploiting and promoting the caste system for their own cynical goals. They hardly created it, but you could argue they brought out the worst in it.
[25/11/2022, 22:41:38] Alice Lafferty: Yes.. I'm not sure how far along this spectrum China is preparing to go.
[25/11/2022, 22:42:49] Alex Regueiro: It will be interesting to see, as an impartial observer... though by the time we know we'll probably already be lamenting it.
[25/11/2022, 22:44:21] Alice Lafferty: Actually, the revolts were themselves a result of Roman overreach. The 66Ad war was triggered by Roman soldiers forcibly entering the Temple treasury under false pretence of tax collection.
[25/11/2022, 22:44:21] Alex Regueiro: China claim to (and indeed mainly evidence) economic hegemony and colonialism outside of their sphere of influence... unlike, say, the American's attempt at worldwide military/political hegemony. But we can't forget the British Empire started off very much as an economic and mercantile endeavour, with a few exceptions.
[25/11/2022, 22:44:48] Alice Lafferty: Is this true? I've kind of only got a one-sided picture I think.
[25/11/2022, 22:46:18] Alice Lafferty: Right... I can see China installing friendly leaders into places like Angola or Djibouti for sure.
[25/11/2022, 22:46:21] Alex Regueiro: I'm not going to argue this, since it's been too long since I read about it. I suspect the Romans may well have been too heavy-handed, but it's also quite telling that the Jews were the only ones to revolt so strongly, and I put this down to their powerful monotheistic religion, clearly incompatible with Roman pantheism/pluralism (unlike almost any other), and a strong and defensive group identity overall, which is only natural given their history... even by that point.
[25/11/2022, 22:47:02] Alex Regueiro: That said, the early Roman history of Judea was very lax in that they devolved a huge amount of power, even more than usual. Herod, for one. The problem was he was quite a bastard to his own people. Which may well prove your earlier point.
[25/11/2022, 22:47:17] Alice Lafferty: I don't think their motivation is entirely economic - they actually have a strong precedent of debt forgiveness in Africa.
[25/11/2022, 22:47:26] Alex Regueiro: My understanding is that it's valid up to a point, but often exaggerated. I'm not terribly knowledgeable about it though.
[25/11/2022, 22:47:35] Alice Lafferty: It does seem to be softer political power they're after.
[25/11/2022, 22:48:11] Alex Regueiro: Right, these "debt traps"... but they expect big concessions of some form or other when they do.
[25/11/2022, 22:48:17] Alex Regueiro: I'd buy that
[25/11/2022, 22:48:24] Alice Lafferty: Haha this is true. Jews have tended to be culturally insular.
[25/11/2022, 22:49:27] Alice Lafferty: And second temple judaism had a strong zealot faction.
[25/11/2022, 22:49:27] Alex Regueiro: They like promoting it as purely economic (and benign) interest in foreign affairs. The truth is less clearcut. I suspect economic colonialism is always destined to turn political, be it with Imperial Britain or modern China, or post WWII US even.
[25/11/2022, 22:49:57] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. The way that started changing in 19th C Europe is really interesting though...
[25/11/2022, 22:50:00] Alice Lafferty: I agree.
[25/11/2022, 22:50:02] Alex Regueiro: not in Russia maybe
[25/11/2022, 22:50:06] Alex Regueiro: but in Germany and Britain and whatnot
[25/11/2022, 22:50:08] Alex Regueiro: France too
[25/11/2022, 22:50:33] Alex Regueiro: Sadly the worst attacks against the Jews came just as they were integrating into mainstream European society more than ever!
[25/11/2022, 22:50:57] Alice Lafferty: They have military bases in some four or five African countries already I believe.
[25/11/2022, 22:51:00] Alex Regueiro: Or perhaps because of it, if you look at the Nazi propaganda and whatnot
[25/11/2022, 22:51:30] Alex Regueiro: üò´
[25/11/2022, 22:52:01] Alice Lafferty: Have to change tact after being formally expelled from pretty much every country on Earth.
[25/11/2022, 22:52:55] Alice Lafferty: To be honest I think it's always been pretty bad.
[25/11/2022, 22:53:20] Alex Regueiro: Yep, though I'd say some European were genuinely being more welcoming and encouraging integration by that point. Britain and certain German states, for one. France and Italy too, to an extent. Not saying antisemitism suddenly disappeared, but it declined drastically in these places with modernisation and industrialisation.
[25/11/2022, 22:53:25] Alice Lafferty: But yes you can't beat the 19th and 20th Cs for scale of persecution.
[25/11/2022, 22:53:37] Alex Regueiro: Especially for non-religious Jews
[25/11/2022, 22:54:07] Alice Lafferty: Haha maybe that is very much the point.
[25/11/2022, 22:54:40] Alex Regueiro: You've got to be really torn about Cromwell on this point... on one hand, he brutally persecuted the Irish and ravaged their country; on the other, he welcomed Jews back to England for the first time since Edward I expelled them!
[25/11/2022, 22:54:46] Alice Lafferty: True it couldn't have been that bad in continental Europe otherwise so many Jewish families would never have been able to establish themselves so well the way they did.
[25/11/2022, 22:55:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, though I suppose at least you can say it wasn't so brutally racial a policy as the Nazis had. They didn't care what religion you practiced or what your predominant culture was.
[25/11/2022, 22:55:52] Alice Lafferty: Ha. I privately like Cromwell... Irish notwithstanding.
[25/11/2022, 22:55:55] Alex Regueiro: Right, the Rothschilds for one... very much rose in the wake of the Enlightenment, liberalisation, industrialisation.
[25/11/2022, 22:56:03] Alex Regueiro: I'm telling your dad
[25/11/2022, 22:56:03] Alex Regueiro: !
[25/11/2022, 22:56:30] Alex Regueiro: I'm actually very torn about him, at a personal and wider level.
[25/11/2022, 22:56:44] Alice Lafferty: Anti-semitism is a great historiographical mystery really.
[25/11/2022, 22:57:02] Alice Lafferty: Specifically the strength and extent of it, I mean.
[25/11/2022, 22:57:21] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure it's quite such a mystery, though I agree it reached inordinate heights and that takes some explaining!
[25/11/2022, 22:59:54] Alex Regueiro: Both are perhaps explained by the huge diaspora and the limited degree of integration in most places, which was a consequence both of prejudice/xenophobia from their host nations and their own wilful insularity/separatism. I'm loath to discuss this too much online though, as it's so easy to misinterpret haha.
[25/11/2022, 23:00:34] Alex Regueiro: I don't want to seem like an even more callous arse than I am, you know?
[25/11/2022, 23:00:47] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm not going to accuse you of 'victim-blaming' or something.
[25/11/2022, 23:00:54] Alice Lafferty: It requires explanation.
[25/11/2022, 23:01:03] Alice Lafferty: Haha not at all!
[25/11/2022, 23:01:20] Alex Regueiro: Right. Purely descriptively, not as justificaiton or anything!
[25/11/2022, 23:02:21] Alice Lafferty: It is difficult to discuss without taking a 'why do you make me hit you' kind of line.
[25/11/2022, 23:02:33] Alex Regueiro: Fundamentally, the history of the Jews is tragic but fascinating.
[25/11/2022, 23:02:36] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, it is
[25/11/2022, 23:03:27] Alice Lafferty: But even if it is partly reluctance to integrate and other internal factors, those themselves need explaining and so on.
[25/11/2022, 23:03:38] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[25/11/2022, 23:04:00] Alex Regueiro: Exactly
[25/11/2022, 23:04:11] Alex Regueiro: Here, I really like Einstein's quote on this...
[25/11/2022, 23:04:43] Alex Regueiro: "For me, the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. ... The Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them."
[25/11/2022, 23:05:36] Alex Regueiro: It may seem a bit New Atheist, but I don't think that was Einstein really. It's a nice tidbit anyway.
[25/11/2022, 23:05:54] Alice Lafferty: So he's suggesting there isn't anything different about them after all? :s
[25/11/2022, 23:06:11] Alice Lafferty: Or they're especially narcissistic?
[25/11/2022, 23:06:19] Alex Regueiro: Well, he decries Jewish exceptionalism, I suppose.
[25/11/2022, 23:06:42] Alex Regueiro: I just thank that's the quote really epitomises the modern, secular, intellectual Jew.
[25/11/2022, 23:07:34] Alex Regueiro: I don't think he's denying they're distinctly "different" to other peoples, their host cultures.
[25/11/2022, 23:08:08] Alice Lafferty: Then why are they in fact treated so differently?
[25/11/2022, 23:08:15] Alex Regueiro: I suppose what I like is the humility. I share his sentiments even though I wouldn't personally be so harsh about any religion, Judaism or other.
[25/11/2022, 23:09:00] Alice Lafferty: I personally don't subscribe to mystical 'spirit of a nation' type explanations either.
[25/11/2022, 23:09:20] Alice Lafferty: Besides they're hardly the only group to have a 'chosen people' mythological identity.
[25/11/2022, 23:09:27] Alex Regueiro: You think they still are? In the past, when you mainly had monocultural states and such an obviously culturally/ethnically distinct minority living in them, I think it was sadly inevitable. Simple outgroup dynamics that got carried away with itself
[25/11/2022, 23:09:40] Alice Lafferty: But I don't see the explanatory power this has for anti-semitism.
[25/11/2022, 23:10:01] Alice Lafferty: Why were they so dispersed in the first place?
[25/11/2022, 23:10:01] Alex Regueiro: I reckon it would have happened if any other strikingly distinct culture had been embedded in many others for centuries... You could argue it did to a large extent, with the Roma
[25/11/2022, 23:10:40] Alice Lafferty: By the way I'm not posing these questions to you particularly! I'm just thinking aloud.
[25/11/2022, 23:11:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh I'm not saying it does. Sorry, I just liked the quote, because it's a famous Jew embracing Jewishness but at the same time eloquently denouncing the sillier aspects of his people's traditions, most notably the "chosen people" idea.
[25/11/2022, 23:11:15] Alex Regueiro: No worries, I get that. I know you well enough by now. üôÇ
[25/11/2022, 23:11:29] Alex Regueiro: The Romans did that
[25/11/2022, 23:11:37] Alex Regueiro: Babylonians to a small extent, but mainly the Romans
[25/11/2022, 23:12:25] Alice Lafferty: No, I agree it's a good quote. But the fact that Jews are so disproportionately the subject of conspiracy theories/persecuted kind of belies his point.
[25/11/2022, 23:13:11] Alice Lafferty: The Romans scattered lots of groups.
[25/11/2022, 23:13:30] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. I suspected he'd agree that they been singled out so often, as a matter of fact. He just means that they're not "intrinsically" chosen or have an inherently superior religion, I think?
[25/11/2022, 23:13:52] Alice Lafferty: It's a fundamental question in Biblical studies too, as to why the fate of the Israelite kingdom turned out so differently to the Judean.
[25/11/2022, 23:13:58] Alex Regueiro: Not to the same extent. The Romans issued some really harsh laws (unusually so) against them, after like the 3rd big revolt.
[25/11/2022, 23:14:43] Alice Lafferty: They were dispersed throughout Europe long before that.
[25/11/2022, 23:15:05] Alex Regueiro: The Charedi have a really interesting view on this. That the Jews should not return to their homeland, and should remain a diaspora, until the coming of the Messiah and the refounding of Jerusalem. Don't agree with it necessarily, just interesting how they embraced the idea of themselves as a diaspora.
[25/11/2022, 23:15:23] Alice Lafferty: There was a Jewish community in Paris in 1C AD.
[25/11/2022, 23:15:34] Alex Regueiro: They really weren't. There were small but significant communities in cities like Rome, Antioch, maybe Greece, before then... but that's all.
[25/11/2022, 23:15:36] Alice Lafferty: *1st century AD
[25/11/2022, 23:15:50] Alex Regueiro: It was far wider following the revolts and the punitive laws.
[25/11/2022, 23:16:42] Alex Regueiro: Yep, a small merchant class or something. Like all peoples conquered by Romans, some sought prosperity across the Empire. But it was a tiny number, not significant. The Italic peoples and Greeks were far more dispersed, for example. The Gauls too, perhaps.
[25/11/2022, 23:16:53] Alice Lafferty: Esp Lyon as well. Ireneaus discusses them.
[25/11/2022, 23:17:03] Alex Regueiro: What date is that?
[25/11/2022, 23:17:13] Alex Regueiro: Some left after the first revolt
[25/11/2022, 23:17:14] Alice Lafferty: 160s-180s maybe
[25/11/2022, 23:17:22] Alex Regueiro: Oh that's well after the third even
[25/11/2022, 23:17:25] Alice Lafferty: So a bit later
[25/11/2022, 23:17:27] Alex Regueiro: Big diaspora by then
[25/11/2022, 23:17:30] Alice Lafferty: But still
[25/11/2022, 23:18:12] Alex Regueiro: Jews were in Rome from the first C BC, and similar in other major cities like Alexandria, Antioch, but not smaller ones. They were basically just economic migrants hoping to make it big. And still outnumbered majorly by other immigrant groups.
[25/11/2022, 23:19:07] Alice Lafferty: Wait a sec I'm going to try and find a textbook.
[25/11/2022, 23:19:12] Alex Regueiro: Okay üôÇ
[25/11/2022, 23:19:35] Alice Lafferty: Committed to this point nowüòÖ
[25/11/2022, 23:20:09] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, I do think there is a little truth to Jewish exceptionalism. Just not that it's a good thing to internalise. It seems objectively true that they have higher average IQ, alongside higher rates of certain rare diseases.
[25/11/2022, 23:52:38] Alex Regueiro: Please don't tell me you're still reading your textbook! I don't want to ruin your evening over a little discussion heh.
[26/11/2022, 02:25:01] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I was looking for a pdf of a book I'd read about Hellenistic Judaism, and then I got distracted and forgot to actually reply to you!  
Josephus: "...there are but two tribes in Asia Minor, Gaul and Rome subject to the Romans, an immense multitude." (if you prefer a non-Christian source). There was already a Jewish diaspora living in Europe in the 1st C AD. And Alexandria was over 1/3 Jewish as early as 332BC. All of this is due to voluntary economic migration, not persecution.
[26/11/2022, 02:25:48] Alice Lafferty: Not the point really matters that much :(
[26/11/2022, 02:26:10] Alice Lafferty: Sorry and goodnight anyway.
[26/11/2022, 02:27:59] Alex Regueiro: Hah that's alright. As long as it was a good distraction!
[26/11/2022, 02:28:03] Alex Regueiro: (I'm still up, as you can see...)
[26/11/2022, 02:28:32] Alex Regueiro: Anyway that's interesting. 1/3 seems like a very hy estimate, considering that's literally the founding date of Alexandria, but it's very close to Judea so...
[26/11/2022, 02:28:46] Alex Regueiro: very high*
[26/11/2022, 02:28:47] Alice Lafferty: It's fine, I was just reading more generally and feeling nostalgic about being at university.
[26/11/2022, 02:28:49] Alex Regueiro: God knows how I typed that
[26/11/2022, 02:29:03] Alice Lafferty: That's one of your best ones I think.
[26/11/2022, 02:29:10] Alex Regueiro: Yahweh knows *
[26/11/2022, 02:29:52] Alex Regueiro: I wish I could blame autocorrect... but I'm not sure what happened. üòÖ
[26/11/2022, 02:30:00] Alex Regueiro: I'll blame the hour
[26/11/2022, 02:30:03] Alice Lafferty: I'm keeping slightly better hours these days.
[26/11/2022, 02:30:08] Alex Regueiro: Oh good
[26/11/2022, 02:30:22] Alex Regueiro: How'd you manage? Did you get on melatonin?
[26/11/2022, 02:30:25] Alice Lafferty: I think I woke up at 11amish or something which is definitely within reasonable bounds.
[26/11/2022, 02:30:38] Alex Regueiro: Wow, yeah. That's pretty good.
[26/11/2022, 02:30:42] Alex Regueiro: all things considered
[26/11/2022, 02:31:43] Alice Lafferty: I know. My tutors admitted that it's an open secret in the field that most of the population estimates from this time period are basically invented off of 'vibes'.
[26/11/2022, 02:32:11] Alice Lafferty: But still, I'm going to use it because it supports my argument. And that's what matters, after all, not accuracy.
[26/11/2022, 02:32:12] Alex Regueiro: Vibes... wonderful. That's most of academia these days, right?
[26/11/2022, 02:32:19] Alex Regueiro: The humanities and social sciences at least
[26/11/2022, 02:32:24] Alex Regueiro: And possibly string theory too
[26/11/2022, 02:33:02] Alice Lafferty: No! I'd need to book a GP appointment.
[26/11/2022, 02:33:03] Alex Regueiro: Love the intellectual integrity. But we live in the post-truth era, so why not right?
[26/11/2022, 02:33:49] Alice Lafferty: I'm just at a part of the cycle that coincides with regular business hours. It won't last that long
[26/11/2022, 02:34:14] Alice Lafferty: Right. Isn't there a huge replication crisis in psychology.
[26/11/2022, 02:34:20] Alex Regueiro: Feeling nostalgic enough to want to return or just being sentimental about the independence and intellectual environment?
[26/11/2022, 02:34:28] Alex Regueiro: Yep, social sciences too I think
[26/11/2022, 02:34:52] Alex Regueiro: Celebrate while it lasts then. üôÇ
[26/11/2022, 02:35:00] Alice Lafferty: God I was absolutely delighted when it came out that psychology was largely bunk. I was literally rubbing my hands together.
[26/11/2022, 02:35:07] Alice Lafferty: Idiots
[26/11/2022, 02:35:20] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[26/11/2022, 02:35:58] Alice Lafferty: Just sentimental! Really I prefer reading in the controlled environment of my own home.
[26/11/2022, 02:36:28] Alex Regueiro: I mean, when the field was founded by Freud, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise should it?
[26/11/2022, 02:36:33] Alice Lafferty: What's yours like?
[26/11/2022, 02:36:36] Alex Regueiro: I suspect the quality varies hugely though
[26/11/2022, 02:37:08] Alex Regueiro: I tend to regulate it by a mix of exercise and melatonin, so it doesn't drift too much these days. Usually just into PM though.
[26/11/2022, 02:37:33] Alice Lafferty: What time of day do you exercise?
[26/11/2022, 02:38:11] Alex Regueiro: Having complete control over your intellectual pursuits is wonderful. If only someone could pay me for such leisure...
[26/11/2022, 02:38:35] Alex Regueiro: Varies between early afternoon and the evening (which is pretty common with tennis)
[26/11/2022, 02:39:05] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. I need to passive income.
[26/11/2022, 02:40:05] Alice Lafferty: That sounds good. Although that would be the 'biological morning' to me.
[26/11/2022, 02:40:44] Alex Regueiro: Midday is sort of my biological morning. Every time I try to move it earlier, I reset pretty quickly. üôÅ Can do it for a few days tops.
[26/11/2022, 02:41:30] Alex Regueiro: To income. Nice verbing.
[26/11/2022, 02:47:13] Alex Regueiro: Incomo
[26/11/2022, 02:47:16] Alex Regueiro: Incomas
[26/11/2022, 02:47:18] Alex Regueiro: Incomat
[26/11/2022, 02:47:20] Alex Regueiro: Incomamus
[26/11/2022, 02:47:22] Alex Regueiro: okay
[26/11/2022, 02:47:29] Alex Regueiro: That's a sign to go to bed. Night!
[26/11/2022, 02:49:57] Alice Lafferty: J'income.
[26/11/2022, 02:50:09] Alice Lafferty: Ok, night
[26/11/2022, 16:36:58] Alex Regueiro: Sounds like a perfume for the rich.
[26/11/2022, 16:37:31] Alex Regueiro: Hope you got a good night's sleep in the end.
[27/11/2022, 21:15:30] Alice Lafferty: I did, thank you.
[28/11/2022, 21:33:55] Alex Regueiro: üôÇ
[28/11/2022, 21:34:16] Alex Regueiro: Been watching much of the football or doing more interesting things?
[28/11/2022, 21:35:18] Alex Regueiro: You're not missing much if so. The few I've caught have been largely disappointing.
[29/11/2022, 19:42:02] Alice Lafferty: I've only been watching the England games.
[29/11/2022, 19:42:32] Alice Lafferty: Watching England v Wales now, hopefully it's not another 0-0 match.
[29/11/2022, 19:43:07] Alice Lafferty: Not really very much else interesting... how about you?
[29/11/2022, 20:17:01] Alex Regueiro: I was going to say, that seems to be our national penance, but we've actually scored now!
[29/11/2022, 20:17:49] Alex Regueiro: Thank goodness. Was bordering on drudgery.
[29/11/2022, 20:20:01] Alex Regueiro: Nothing terribly exciting. I'm over my cold at least.
[29/11/2022, 20:20:11] Alex Regueiro: Been doing a little work, and had some interesting chats with salon people online.
[29/11/2022, 20:54:43] Alice Lafferty: Good!
[29/11/2022, 20:55:32] Alice Lafferty: What sort of people are part of this salon and what were you talking about?
[29/11/2022, 21:14:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh we're all Nazis
[29/11/2022, 21:14:03] Alex Regueiro: Clearly
[29/11/2022, 21:14:20] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I'm pretty sure that's how Guardianistas picture us...
[29/11/2022, 21:14:53] Alex Regueiro: It's the London "free speech salon" (part of Free Speech Champions and has less direct links to the Free Speech Union)
[29/11/2022, 21:16:50] Alex Regueiro: Mainly recent graduates and young professionals. (Early 20s to early 30s for the most part.) Quite a range of views... basically anyone dissatisfied with the status quo, the establishment. Probably a mix of libertarians, classical liberlals, and neo-conservatives roughly?
[29/11/2022, 21:17:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and we were talking about Christian persecution
[29/11/2022, 21:17:06] Alex Regueiro: Someone brought this up: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2022-0200/
[29/11/2022, 21:17:11] Alice Lafferty: Ohh, I had no idea. I thought it was a totally informal gathering fo friends!
[29/11/2022, 21:17:34] Alex Regueiro: And some article from a few years, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-christian-convert-asylum-refused-bible-not-peaceful-a8832026.html
[29/11/2022, 21:18:07] Alice Lafferty: I guess it's not surprising that it attracts those political types.
[29/11/2022, 21:18:20] Alex Regueiro: It kind of is. In theory it's open, but we all know each other fairly well by now. It's mainly a bunch of regulars. üôÇ
[29/11/2022, 21:18:58] Alex Regueiro: Yes, basically it's just a forum to discuss politically or philosophically controversial topics, and an excuse to have a few drinks and some banter.
[29/11/2022, 21:19:24] Alex Regueiro: WhatsApp group gets spicy occasionally, though less often these days!
[29/11/2022, 21:19:36] Alice Lafferty: By the way I was reading some Burke out of interest. It's funny that you seem to like him as a political scientist, because I don't think you'd agree with his metaphysics... he was a pure idealist.
[29/11/2022, 21:19:58] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah, I don't really know anything about his metaphysics
[29/11/2022, 21:20:12] Alex Regueiro: I used to be a subjective idealist, a proper Berkeleian, though...
[29/11/2022, 21:20:38] Alice Lafferty: This seems really far-fetched?
[29/11/2022, 21:21:11] Alice Lafferty: Haven't read the whole article yet but I really struggle to belive immigration would bother coming up with such a complex reason to reject a refugee.
[29/11/2022, 21:21:16] Alex Regueiro: It does. Seems to have happened though! The sort of sensational but very rare story that newspapers lap up
[29/11/2022, 21:21:36] Alex Regueiro: We got onto that topic from a tangent, mind you
[29/11/2022, 21:21:57] Alice Lafferty: I've said this before, but it sounds really fun, and I'm glad such groups exist really.
[29/11/2022, 21:23:06] Alice Lafferty: Interesting... I also used to belief that political positions were at least somewhat influenced by more basis philosophical positions but also maybe wrong...
[29/11/2022, 21:23:09] Alice Lafferty: *basic
[29/11/2022, 21:23:12] Alex Regueiro: I felt a little awkward about inviting you previously (hope you don't mind me saying)... just because we'd recently met and were going on. But now that we're friends... I'd be happy to have you join us if you fancy it!
[29/11/2022, 21:24:04] Alice Lafferty: Don't these kind of groups by nature ward off people who hold minority opinions though.
[29/11/2022, 21:24:40] Alex Regueiro: In theory they should be, shouldn't they? Marxism depending on materialism is a big one. I know Marx personally railed against idealists in philosophy. But I think to a large extent they're separable in practice. Or at least their metaphysics often get shunted aside or reformed.
[29/11/2022, 21:24:41] Alice Lafferty: I mean if I was a single libertarian in a group of 20 traditionalist conservatives I think I might just give up and find another group.
[29/11/2022, 21:24:55] Alice Lafferty: I mean the group must be self-selecting to some degre
[29/11/2022, 21:24:57] Alice Lafferty: *e
[29/11/2022, 21:25:12] Alex Regueiro: Stoicism is an interesting one. The ethics get all the attention (rightly so), but there's a whole Stoic logic & metaphysics that is essential to their ethics, so claimed the Stoics.
[29/11/2022, 21:25:47] Alice Lafferty: Maybe metaphysics is a post hoc rationalisation of political convictionsüò≥
[29/11/2022, 21:26:00] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's really really hard to avoid that. Free association can't help but give rise to like-minded people clustering and people with divergent views feeling or actually getting ostracised.
[29/11/2022, 21:26:15] Alex Regueiro: I'd say we maintain a pretty good level of intellectual (and other!) diversity though, all things considered.
[29/11/2022, 21:26:49] Alice Lafferty: Do you ever meet formally with other groups, say progressives etc
[29/11/2022, 21:26:56] Alex Regueiro: By its very nature, there are no apathetic pro-establishment types there really. But there's a good left-right spectrum at least.
[29/11/2022, 21:27:14] Alex Regueiro: Yes, succinctly put! Quite possibly so.
[29/11/2022, 21:27:30] Alice Lafferty: I completely understand that. Are you sure?
[29/11/2022, 21:28:09] Alice Lafferty: I can't tell whether thus constitutes a formal invitation or whether you're just being casual. Because I will actually come
[29/11/2022, 21:28:51] Alice Lafferty: I also won't take offence if you don't want me to by the way.
[29/11/2022, 21:28:52] Alex Regueiro: Some of the people in the group would describe themselves as "progressives" in certain ways, but yeah... we had a few at the start, but they went behind everyone's backs and squealed to the Guardian. This was just before I joined. One was the president of the Bristol Free Speech Society while I was there. He genuinely thought (and openly stated) that he viewed "free speech" as a tool for cultural revolution.
[29/11/2022, 21:29:38] Alice Lafferty: Haha classic
[29/11/2022, 21:30:12] Alex Regueiro: I hereby formally extend my welcome to Alice Lafferty to join the FSC London Salon and attend the next gathering she is able to make. üìú
[29/11/2022, 21:30:15] Alex Regueiro: Is that clear enough? üôÇ
[29/11/2022, 21:30:41] Alex Regueiro: No, I'd be more than happy to have you there. I think you'd be able to make some great contributions to discussion.
[29/11/2022, 21:30:43] Alice Lafferty: Haha, this is so thrilling for me.
[29/11/2022, 21:30:56] Alice Lafferty: When is the next gathering?
[29/11/2022, 21:31:31] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to immediately get designated as the 'religious voice in the room' if they find out about my Shame (theology degree...)
[29/11/2022, 21:32:22] Alex Regueiro: Most of us genuinely like dissent, so long as its polite! You know that hardcore Calvinist friend I mentioned? He used to come, until he got fed up of all the "classical liberal" types. He's culturally very conservative and economically very lefty. I mean, so am I in some sense you could say, but he was more extreme on both ends. Anyway, even the people he routinely disagreed with wanted him to keep coming. üôÇ
[29/11/2022, 21:32:56] Alex Regueiro: Hah. But we have actual committed Christians, so don't worry... will be fun. You can even correct them on their theology perhaps!
[29/11/2022, 21:33:10] Alice Lafferty: I might be a bit out of my depth if most people there are graduates many times over (like you are)? But I would very much like to come, even just to listen in.
[29/11/2022, 21:34:07] Alex Regueiro: We were thinking of having one on the 14th. I'm trying to arrange a Christmas "party" (casual night out really) with another organiser too... that will be shortly after. Anyway you can either come to that one or the first one of the new year, no pressure either way. üôÇ
[29/11/2022, 21:34:41] Alex Regueiro: Some people are much quieter than others, so don't worry how much you contribute. Just always feel free to speak your mind. (It's in the name.)
[29/11/2022, 21:35:02] Alice Lafferty: Right, you need these people to make dialectical progress.
[29/11/2022, 21:35:29] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I'm pretty sure I can make the 14th.
[29/11/2022, 21:36:05] Alice Lafferty: You might have to give me more details closer to the time. Thank you for inviting me anyway!
[29/11/2022, 21:36:58] Alex Regueiro: Of course. It's not even confirmed yet. (Date or topic.) But definitely will.
[29/11/2022, 21:37:14] Alex Regueiro: It's usually at the Sekford in Farringdon, occasionally at The Angel near TCR.
[29/11/2022, 21:38:01] Alex Regueiro: You do. The softer (read, not rabidly self-righteous and neo-Puritanical) progressives would also be nice to get in, though that's harder.
[29/11/2022, 21:38:21] Alice Lafferty: Are these things usually just decided communally or is there someone in an organisational role?
[29/11/2022, 21:38:39] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[29/11/2022, 21:38:50] Alex Regueiro: So you're not away skiing over Christmas?
[29/11/2022, 21:39:27] Alex Regueiro: Used to just be one guy, Laurie. He started the London salon, one of the founding "Free Speech Champions". (I'm not, but I help with a lot of organisation these days.)
[29/11/2022, 21:39:36] Alice Lafferty: No, not this year I don't think. December 27th-January 5th I think?
[29/11/2022, 21:39:38] Alex Regueiro: Lately we've been spreading it out, and any regular member can propose a topic and sort of host a salon
[29/11/2022, 21:40:03] Alex Regueiro: We're certainly not very hierarchical.
[29/11/2022, 21:40:28] Alex Regueiro: Oh so you are away, just later? Anyway sounds good.
[29/11/2022, 21:40:32] Alice Lafferty: I was just about to say this is perhaps surprising from a group of predominately conservatives haha
[29/11/2022, 21:41:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly. Are you going anywhere? Do you still get invited on holiday with your parents?
[29/11/2022, 21:41:18] Alex Regueiro: Haha. JP would be aghast, wouldn't he?
[29/11/2022, 21:41:39] Alex Regueiro: Actually we're kind of an even mix of conservatives and classical liberals, and some don't fit either label properly
[29/11/2022, 21:41:55] Alice Lafferty: It sounds nice and relaxed though and I look forward to it!
[29/11/2022, 21:42:46] Alice Lafferty: You're like an ecumenical council of the right.
[29/11/2022, 21:42:49] Alex Regueiro: I do sometimes, but in truth I'm a bit wary. Partly it's just I like my independence at my age (especially when I can't quite move out yet), and partly my dad can be a nightmare to travel with sometimes haha
[29/11/2022, 21:43:09] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. It's funny, because classical liberalism used to be considered the left but... not for a while
[29/11/2022, 21:43:16] Alex Regueiro: There are a couple of left-libertarians too
[29/11/2022, 21:43:35] Alex Regueiro: But you're mainly accurate in your summary
[29/11/2022, 21:43:53] Alice Lafferty: Haha same actually. I will freeload off them if they're going somewhere nice but otherwise I'm fine at home too.
[29/11/2022, 21:44:05] Alex Regueiro: It is. It's really chill, but also stimulating. Some salons are better than others, and attendance varies from maybe 6-16, but it's almost always good fun.
[29/11/2022, 21:44:56] Alex Regueiro: I think the last time I went skiing (in Jan?), we stayed in a shared chalet sort of thing and I got an abysmal case of bronchitis. So did my dad and sis.
[29/11/2022, 21:45:03] Alex Regueiro: Was a teenager then.
[29/11/2022, 21:45:16] Alex Regueiro: So although I like skiing, and the odd holiday with my parents, that definitely put me off it for a while...
[29/11/2022, 21:45:42] Alice Lafferty: Oh that sucks.
[29/11/2022, 21:45:58] Alice Lafferty: My dad got quite serious pneumonia on a skiing holiday a few years ago.
[29/11/2022, 21:46:04] Alex Regueiro: The Lincolnshire getaway was with them, but apart from that, our last trip together was to the Isle of Wight over the summer in-between lockdowns. That was pretty pleasant to be fair.
[29/11/2022, 21:46:08] Alex Regueiro: Oh dear
[29/11/2022, 21:46:21] Alex Regueiro: That's even more serious. Had to be hospitalised?
[29/11/2022, 21:46:46] Alice Lafferty: I actually really like travelling around the UK and really intend to do more of it.
[29/11/2022, 21:46:57] Alex Regueiro: It's the combo of biting cold and lots of germ-ridden holidaymakers staying together, I reckon.
[29/11/2022, 21:47:14] Alice Lafferty: Travel is so much easier and you don't get so much of that kind of displaced unfamiliar feeling.
[29/11/2022, 21:47:40] Alice Lafferty: I've never been to the Isle of Wight though! Reccomend?
[29/11/2022, 21:47:47] Alice Lafferty: *recommend :s
[29/11/2022, 21:47:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Honestly, one of the upsides of Lockdown for me was realising just how much beauty (and even diversity) there is within the UK. Cities and countryside alike.
[29/11/2022, 21:48:13] Alex Regueiro: Definitely! I could recommend a few towns/sights in particular when you consider it properly.
[29/11/2022, 21:48:54] Alex Regueiro: Ventnor is a lovely town. The other one in my mind, I forget its name. Really twee, but not in a sickly way
[29/11/2022, 21:49:03] Alice Lafferty: Yes... fortunately my parents tend to rent like a small place whenever they go on holiday. So don't tend to stay much in resort type places.
[29/11/2022, 21:49:36] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. Sometimes it's nice to go abroad, but often the cost-benefit doesn't merit it. And if you do, there's more than enough in Europe (or the Near East) most of the time.
[29/11/2022, 21:50:00] Alex Regueiro: It wasn't a resort we stayed at exactly, but it was a large chalet shared by a few families. A perfect germ incubator.
[29/11/2022, 21:50:10] Alice Lafferty: Ok nice! Maybe it's more like a summer destination, I get the impression...? I would like to plan some trips.
[29/11/2022, 21:51:12] Alice Lafferty: Would really like to go up to some of the Scottish islands too.
[29/11/2022, 21:51:32] Alice Lafferty: Into France by train is really good I think.
[29/11/2022, 21:51:50] Alice Lafferty: Were there young children?
[29/11/2022, 21:53:06] Alex Regueiro: Can't remember to be honest
[29/11/2022, 21:53:10] Alex Regueiro: I was in my teens
[29/11/2022, 21:53:30] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'd love that. The Hebrides in particular. Last time (only time) I was in Scotland, I only got as far as Helensborough sadly.
[29/11/2022, 21:53:41] Alice Lafferty: They're very effective at spreading illnesses.
[29/11/2022, 21:53:45] Alex Regueiro: Definitely. Osborne House was beautiful in the summer.
[29/11/2022, 21:53:52] Alex Regueiro: And some of the coastal villages too.
[29/11/2022, 21:54:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, train is far more pleasant. I did that when I last went to Paris/Fontainebleau a few years  back
[29/11/2022, 21:54:20] Alex Regueiro: See Fingal's cave! And Iona. üôÇ
[29/11/2022, 21:54:28] Alice Lafferty: I think I've only been once. Stac Pollaidgh or something like that...? I was pretty young.
[29/11/2022, 21:55:12] Alice Lafferty: I would love to go to Iona! There's a wonderful stone circle there!
[29/11/2022, 21:55:59] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm going to float all of this to my parents. They're really into walking and seafood.
[29/11/2022, 21:56:51] Alex Regueiro: Walking and seafood... that's my dad in a nutshell!
[29/11/2022, 21:56:53] Alex Regueiro: Anyway sounds good
[29/11/2022, 21:57:14] Alex Regueiro: I think you'd really love it. That summer was balmy, so perfect for 4/5 days down there like we did
‚Äé[29/11/2022, 21:57:56] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/11/2022, 21:58:24] Alex Regueiro: Shanklin. That's the place I was thinking of. There are so many interesting/pretty things to do packed into a tiny island though.
[29/11/2022, 21:58:48] Alex Regueiro: Oh I didn't know that. Or forgot it. Is the abbey just a pile of rubble now?
[29/11/2022, 22:07:26] Alex Regueiro: By the way, I stumbled across this yesterday. Would be curious on your thoughts if it piques your interesting. https://unherd.com/2022/10/the-year-of-the-femcel/
[29/11/2022, 22:08:05] Alex Regueiro: To be clear, just because I thought this might be something you muse about; I'm not remotely implying you're one of them haha!
[29/11/2022, 23:58:02] Alice Lafferty: This looks really pretty (although the tarmac is kind of jarring)
[30/11/2022, 00:00:18] Alice Lafferty: It was actually rebuilt in the late 19th C I believe... it looks like it's been quite tastefully done.
[30/11/2022, 00:01:25] Alice Lafferty: Honestly - I think this message already contains the implication that I am one.
[30/11/2022, 00:01:58] Alice Lafferty: Else why would it be interesting to me? I don't know how else to take it.
[30/11/2022, 00:02:38] Alex Regueiro: Sorry! I just thought it was interesting from an intellectual perspective
[30/11/2022, 00:02:40] Alice Lafferty: Mary Gaitskill is a writer I really like though. She's kind of a maverick.
[30/11/2022, 00:03:08] Alex Regueiro: The only reason I wrote that is because you said you felt kind of misandrist at points in the past.
[30/11/2022, 00:03:09] Alice Lafferty: I'd already read the article actually.
[30/11/2022, 00:03:19] Alex Regueiro: And maybe that's one thing in common
[30/11/2022, 00:03:52] Alex Regueiro: (For the record, I hate the incel culture, but I've share one or two feelings with them in my darker moments too!)
[30/11/2022, 00:04:01] Alice Lafferty: I don't think she is a misandrist?
[30/11/2022, 00:04:02] Alex Regueiro: Oh cool
[30/11/2022, 00:04:23] Alex Regueiro: No no, not her. But femcels would be?
[30/11/2022, 00:04:30] Alex Regueiro: Anyway. Just an interesting social trend
[30/11/2022, 00:05:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I can imagine. She has nice style. I also thought when reading it that she made one or two points that sounded like you. üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 00:05:28] Alex Regueiro: let me find the one...
[30/11/2022, 00:05:49] Alice Lafferty: Not really. I think they're more self-hating that anything else.
[30/11/2022, 00:07:10] Alice Lafferty: I thought she spent too long talking about her own experiences. There was probably a lot more to be said about 'femcel' as a 21st C conceptual identity, specifically an 'internet identity'.
[30/11/2022, 00:07:39] Alex Regueiro: I think she was saying that they're less misandrist then incels are misogynist, but that a good portion of them still are, no?  Or maybe I read that elsewhere.
[30/11/2022, 00:08:02] Alice Lafferty: For the record, I have never identified myself as such, particularly, but I can very easily see how that label could be applied to me externally. As she did to the girls she discussed in her article.
[30/11/2022, 00:08:03] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's quite a personal article. Which makes it nice in a sense, though not the best appraisal of a wider social trend.
[30/11/2022, 00:08:59] Alex Regueiro: God no. Sorry. I really phrased that the wrong way originally. I was worried you might assume that was why I was linking you to the article, rather than just wanting your opinion on something I know you've thought about a fair bit.
[30/11/2022, 00:09:14] Alice Lafferty: I think the 'misandry' of femcels is literally just an affective stance rather than an actual political one.
[30/11/2022, 00:09:35] Alex Regueiro: It may be true what incels say, that if femcels ‚Äúlowered their standards‚Äù (that is, if they would have sex with anyone), they could. But I think this is probably true of young men as well: that they, too, could have sex if they would accept literally anyone.
[30/11/2022, 00:09:42] Alice Lafferty: It's ok! I understand why you would think that given how much I talked about being unattractive etc
[30/11/2022, 00:09:57] Alice Lafferty: This is true.
[30/11/2022, 00:10:02] Alex Regueiro: That paragraph. I thought you might have said something like that. Or maybe it's just that I strongly agree with it?
[30/11/2022, 00:10:19] Alice Lafferty: Oh haha was this a quote?
[30/11/2022, 00:10:25] Alex Regueiro: haha yes
[30/11/2022, 00:10:30] Alex Regueiro: pulled it from the article
[30/11/2022, 00:10:32] Alice Lafferty: Well yes! She's right
[30/11/2022, 00:10:56] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, never know how to quote paragraphs in chat. I like ¬´¬ª. Very continental European though
[30/11/2022, 00:11:27] Alice Lafferty: I tend to put it like this: the experience of unattractive men and women is quite similiar it's just that *there are more unattractive men than there are women*
[30/11/2022, 00:11:35] Alice Lafferty: Ugh I hate the bold text.
[30/11/2022, 00:11:39] Alice Lafferty: O for an italiciser...
[30/11/2022, 00:11:39] Alex Regueiro: Glad you understand. But yeah, I think her article is almost reassuring in that it suggests if women (or men) find their niche, they can overcome points that work against them, quite well in fact
[30/11/2022, 00:12:21] Alice Lafferty: This is much better actually yes. Going to use that in future. Sometimes use ,xxx' too.
[30/11/2022, 00:13:44] Alice Lafferty: I don't really see that... I think some people are genuinely hopelessly below the attractiveness standard of what even an 'incel' of the opposite sex would consider. Barring like, extreme cosmetic surgery.
[30/11/2022, 00:13:50] Alex Regueiro: Hah. It's fooled me before too. There's a common text format in the software dev world where * means italic and ** means bold. Ugh.
[30/11/2022, 00:14:14] Alice Lafferty: Again, there are more men than women in this position becaus men on average have lower standards than women. * not NO standards though.
[30/11/2022, 00:14:29] Alex Regueiro: Oh I'm not saying it's everyone. But I do think it applies to a portion of femcels or potential femcels.
[30/11/2022, 00:14:59] Alex Regueiro: more unattractive men than there are unattractive women, or than there are women full stop? üòõ
[30/11/2022, 00:15:35] Alice Lafferty: It's pretty interesting that she kind of semi-identified herself with that group... I've seen pictures of her when she was young and she was quite attractive.
[30/11/2022, 00:15:43] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I don't think I got the best angle. Then again, a quaint cobblestone street would do wonders...
[30/11/2022, 00:16:13] Alex Regueiro: My impression is that she didn't quite put herself in the group but she did see how easy it is to slip into it, and show a lot of empathy.
[30/11/2022, 00:16:39] Alice Lafferty: The percentage of women who are unable to find a sexual partner is smaller than the same percentage of men (but still nontrivial).
[30/11/2022, 00:16:48] Alex Regueiro: Right
[30/11/2022, 00:16:50] Alex Regueiro: That's true
[30/11/2022, 00:16:57] Alice Lafferty: Because on average men are more promiscuous.
[30/11/2022, 00:17:40] Alex Regueiro: Yes. More desirous of sex or a partner, as well. Even the monogamous ones.
[30/11/2022, 00:18:00] Alice Lafferty: I think the most 'empathetic' thing you can do in this situation is donate to their plastic surgery bills.
[30/11/2022, 00:18:27] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[30/11/2022, 00:19:00] Alex Regueiro: I saw a terrible new-feminist take the other day that said that's nonsense because "if you look at how women were portrayed historically, they were always the lascivious ones who needed to be controlled"... well, YEAH, but that was men writing about their fears!
[30/11/2022, 00:19:16] Alice Lafferty: But anyway, I think there have been better write-ups than hers (as much as I like her).
[30/11/2022, 00:19:26] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and the conclusion was "therefore women are actually more sexualised, just ignore biology".
[30/11/2022, 00:19:56] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure there have been. I'm glad I picked out a writer you like at least though
[30/11/2022, 00:20:03] Alice Lafferty: ? She was trying to claim that women actually have higher libidos than men?
[30/11/2022, 00:20:19] Alex Regueiro: yep
[30/11/2022, 00:20:26] Alice Lafferty: --Your brain on social constructivism--
[30/11/2022, 00:20:33] Alex Regueiro: and are naturally more promiscuous
[30/11/2022, 00:20:55] Alice Lafferty: To be fair it is curious that this idea would have ever come about?
[30/11/2022, 00:20:58] Alex Regueiro: Just, you know, completely ignore some of the most well-evidence evo psych and generally biology around.
[30/11/2022, 00:21:10] Alice Lafferty: I guess it's just that men project their own sexuality onto women a lot of the time.
[30/11/2022, 00:21:57] Alex Regueiro: It's like the anti-Louise Perry view. That the Sexual Revolution unlocked the full potential women, and lets them find fulfilment in their natural behaviour.
[30/11/2022, 00:22:28] Alex Regueiro: Definitely that too. Generates some insecurity/fear (some of which is fair, but which often got grossly exaggerated in the past).
[30/11/2022, 00:24:04] Alice Lafferty: What I don't quite get about her position is why she takes it as given that women 'have to' be sexually promiscuous post-60s?
[30/11/2022, 00:24:21] Alice Lafferty: I think she kind of de-agentifies women a lot.
[30/11/2022, 00:24:55] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. I don't know her work well, but I suppose she'd say social pressure and norms take care of the rest?
[30/11/2022, 00:25:26] Alice Lafferty: She makes a bit of a leap between 'casual sex is destigmatised' and 'women are forced to participate in it' - this is not true at all?
[30/11/2022, 00:25:30] Alex Regueiro: I don't think the fact that a lot of women are now pushing back against such expectations/norms is necessarily contradictory.
[30/11/2022, 00:26:06] Alex Regueiro: I think she'd also argue the revolution was about more than just destigmatisation
[30/11/2022, 00:26:14] Alex Regueiro: indeed a promotion of such a lifestyle
[30/11/2022, 00:26:27] Alice Lafferty: I have very little sympathy for people who do things because of 'pressure', expectations', or '''attitudes'''.
[30/11/2022, 00:26:29] Alex Regueiro: May or may not be right
[30/11/2022, 00:26:51] Alice Lafferty: But you literally don't have to participate in it if you don't want to?
[30/11/2022, 00:28:11] Alex Regueiro: I used to be like that too. These days I'm still harsh about feckless types, but I understand that most humans just are just sheepish and not remotely independent-minded. It's more a pity... though I have to guard against getting too conceited.
[30/11/2022, 00:28:40] Alice Lafferty: I think it has some very awkward implications. If the average woman has such a weak sense of self she can't make an agentic decision about who she has sex with - well, what other decisions can't she make?
[30/11/2022, 00:28:48] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of infantilising - you see?
[30/11/2022, 00:29:13] Alex Regueiro: It's so much easier to fall in line with the herd, especially if you're not naturally inclined towards independent thought, towards questioning things for yourself. Part of that is a failure of education perhaps, part of it is just "normality".
[30/11/2022, 00:30:03] Alex Regueiro: It is. Though I think contemporary society infantilises your average man or woman to a high degree anyway.
[30/11/2022, 00:30:28] Alice Lafferty: I appreciate that people are heavily influenced by social norms, but like... it does not absolve them of personal responsibility.
[30/11/2022, 00:30:42] Alice Lafferty: Listen to me, I sound like a Tory.
[30/11/2022, 00:30:45] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[30/11/2022, 00:30:58] Alex Regueiro: It's quite a classical liberal view too.
[30/11/2022, 00:32:08] Alex Regueiro: The idea that we're all completely free rational beings or can even become such is a harmful one however. One of the great fallacies of the Enlightnment. (Not that we shouldn't aim for it to some extent. But we can and should admit our inextricable human irrational tendencies.)
[30/11/2022, 00:32:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I have to catch myself sometimes because I'm understanding that my instinctive emotive inclination is to basically say 'deal with it yourself'.
[30/11/2022, 00:32:21] Alice Lafferty: *libertarian almost.
[30/11/2022, 00:32:28] Alice Lafferty: Not that I necessarily think this correct.
[30/11/2022, 00:32:36] Alex Regueiro: Now you sound like JP even!
[30/11/2022, 00:32:44] Alex Regueiro: (Sorry, that's too harsh)
[30/11/2022, 00:33:00] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I'd go as far as to say rational! But yeah
[30/11/2022, 00:33:36] Alice Lafferty: It's also contrary to most of our scientific understanding of group behaviour.
[30/11/2022, 00:34:16] Alex Regueiro: In my ideal world, everyone strives to be an independent and largely rational agent, but is wholly at piece with their very particular human drives.
[30/11/2022, 00:34:43] Alice Lafferty: Also re the sex-negative feminists, their project is essentially hopeless because social norms change according to technological capacity.
[30/11/2022, 00:34:45] Alex Regueiro: And a recognition they're part of a group/community that needs to get along to a *certain* degree
[30/11/2022, 00:35:04] Alice Lafferty: If they want to see the SR reversed, they would have to literally sabotage the birth control factories.
[30/11/2022, 00:35:14] Alex Regueiro: Material determinism again. üòÄ I actually agree with you for the most part here.
[30/11/2022, 00:35:20] Alex Regueiro: There's no turning the clock back
[30/11/2022, 00:35:25] Alice Lafferty: Writing books won't make a single bit of difference.
[30/11/2022, 00:35:53] Alex Regueiro: But there can be an education of how different lifestyles and social norms are more or less beneficial for different types and for society as a whole.
[30/11/2022, 00:36:12] Alex Regueiro: It will provoke debate and self-reflection at least! But that's not enough, I admit.
[30/11/2022, 00:36:13] Alice Lafferty: I agree. It can be used, it will be used.
[30/11/2022, 00:36:43] Alice Lafferty: It will give the commentariat something to talk about yeah..
[30/11/2022, 00:36:54] Alice Lafferty: But that's it.
[30/11/2022, 00:37:35] Alex Regueiro: The bourgeois intellectualising class too. (Of which I grudgingly concede I'm a member.)
[30/11/2022, 00:38:07] Alice Lafferty: Haha, yeah.
[30/11/2022, 00:39:45] Alice Lafferty: Stigmatisation of extra-marital sex has community wide benefits but extremely high costs to defectors... so is kind of utilitarian argument, in a sense.
[30/11/2022, 00:40:36] Alice Lafferty: I'm talking about a spectrum of social mechanisms ranging from Magdalen laundries to honour killings.
[30/11/2022, 00:40:57] Alex Regueiro: Kind of yes. I can't quite shake my once-affinity for utilitarianism...
[30/11/2022, 00:41:36] Alex Regueiro: I can't help but think that some sort of stigmatisation is far more beneficial than harmful to your average person... but probably fairly low on the overall scale.
[30/11/2022, 00:42:18] Alice Lafferty: Yes agree about the average person. But huge injustices happen in edge cases...
[30/11/2022, 00:42:24] Alex Regueiro: Low level of stigma, I mean.
[30/11/2022, 00:42:30] Alex Regueiro: What sort of injustices are you picturing?
[30/11/2022, 00:43:03] Alex Regueiro: (I don't consider depriving nymphomaniacs of opportunity to fulfil their hedonistic dreams any grave injustice!)
[30/11/2022, 00:43:07] Alice Lafferty: Ostracisation, honour killings...
[30/11/2022, 00:43:12] Alex Regueiro: Oh right
[30/11/2022, 00:43:13] Alex Regueiro: in that sense
[30/11/2022, 00:44:08] Alex Regueiro: I mean, ostracisation of single mothers is an issue. A really delicate point though, because the problems it generates for both the child and for society as a whole are still significant.
[30/11/2022, 00:44:40] Alex Regueiro: Honour killings are clearly way too far into reactionary paleoconservative territory.
[30/11/2022, 00:44:58] Alice Lafferty: Me neither. It's just that it has horrific failure-modes, eg. rape victims being murdered etc.
[30/11/2022, 00:45:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I know
[30/11/2022, 00:45:21] Alex Regueiro: That really shocked me the first time I heard of it
[30/11/2022, 00:46:15] Alice Lafferty: I have my own thoughts about single motherhood/children of divorce which slightly departs from the rw line.
[30/11/2022, 00:46:27] Alex Regueiro: Do tell, I'm curious
[30/11/2022, 00:46:48] Alice Lafferty: Some of the data doesn't really add up.
[30/11/2022, 00:47:34] Alex Regueiro: I know it happened in medieval times. But I think honour killings in modern times are more or less restricted to premarital sex. Not that makes it much less horrific, but still...
[30/11/2022, 00:47:44] Alice Lafferty: https://care.org.uk/news/2022/04/divorce-worse-for-children-than-bereavement-study-shows
[30/11/2022, 00:48:24] Alice Lafferty: Children who lose a father to illness fare worse than children who 'lose' a father due to parental separation. Think about the implications of this for a second.
[30/11/2022, 00:48:41] Alice Lafferty: I don't think they were ever commonplace in Europe.
[30/11/2022, 00:49:00] Alice Lafferty: I think they're specific to Islamic MENA. Just like veiling and seclusion.
[30/11/2022, 00:49:04] Alex Regueiro: Remember being shocked seeing it in Cathedral of the Sea (very good Spanish miniseries)
[30/11/2022, 00:49:47] Alex Regueiro: They were somewhat common in parts of medieval Europe. Honour killings of women who committed adultery occasionally happened well into the 20th C in southern Italy (and Greece I think).
[30/11/2022, 00:49:51] Alice Lafferty: The reason why MENA is so much more patriarchal than almost anywhere else is a really interesting anthropological question but anyway
[30/11/2022, 00:49:58] Alex Regueiro: My Italian researcher told me this just the other day. Was shocked to hear it.
[30/11/2022, 00:50:27] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I did not know this...
[30/11/2022, 00:50:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Surely a consequence in part of the hold Islam has over the people.
[30/11/2022, 00:50:33] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I was thinking of NW Europe.
[30/11/2022, 00:50:59] Alice Lafferty: Where they took the shotgun wedding or banishment strategies.
[30/11/2022, 00:51:03] Alice Lafferty: Not great, but much better.
[30/11/2022, 00:51:12] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. In northern Europe I think it declined much earlier thanks to the liberalising effects of the Reformation.
[30/11/2022, 00:51:19] Alex Regueiro: right
[30/11/2022, 00:51:48] Alice Lafferty: What do you mean 'your Italian researcher'?
[30/11/2022, 00:52:17] Alex Regueiro: I think you'd like the series by the way. It's just a good medieval tale at its heart.
[30/11/2022, 00:52:38] Alex Regueiro: The Italian woman who helps me research my ancestors from over there.
[30/11/2022, 00:52:46] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[30/11/2022, 00:53:08] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see.
[30/11/2022, 00:53:27] Alex Regueiro: (There's a sequel I haven't seen too)
[30/11/2022, 00:54:39] Alex Regueiro: As long as you can tolerate a little sensationalism...
[30/11/2022, 00:55:26] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, as I was saying - I suspect that the link between negative life outcomes and being a child of divorce is not causal.
[30/11/2022, 00:56:09] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. What would it be then?
[30/11/2022, 00:56:22] Alice Lafferty: I like that kind of Arthurian stuff, so yes!
[30/11/2022, 00:57:12] Alex Regueiro: If you've seen Pillars of the Earth, it's a lot like that I'm told. (I haven't, however)
[30/11/2022, 00:57:39] Alice Lafferty: People with certain personality traits (poor impulse control, disagreeability, propensity towards addiction and many others) are more likely to divorce. Their children inherit these personality traits, and themselves have poor life outcomes as a consequence.
[30/11/2022, 00:58:03] Alice Lafferty: Otherwise how do you account for the fact that fatherlessness due to death has fewer negative correlates?
[30/11/2022, 00:58:15] Alice Lafferty: *than fatherlessness due to divorce?
[30/11/2022, 00:59:12] Alice Lafferty: I suspect divorce is symptomatic, not causal, basically.
[30/11/2022, 00:59:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, Excalibur is a gem, we agree. John Boorman did some other great stuff, like Zardoz (wacky and wonderful).
[30/11/2022, 00:59:31] Alex Regueiro: Hmm
[30/11/2022, 00:59:47] Alice Lafferty: I haven't. Have said this before but I don't watch a lot of TV. Probably missed some good stuff.
[30/11/2022, 00:59:48] Alex Regueiro: That may well account for some of the correlation
[30/11/2022, 00:59:55] Alex Regueiro: But I'd be loath to attribute all of it to it
[30/11/2022, 01:00:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, you did. I'm not a big TV watcher myself, but I went through a phase where I dug up lots of old classics. üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 01:01:07] Alex Regueiro: I believe there *is* some more clearly evidence of causal connection in the academic literature, but I wouldn't want to put %s on it
[30/11/2022, 01:01:31] Alice Lafferty: Why would your parents getting divorced mess you up so badly in a way that like death of a parent, poverty, childhood illness doesn't? It doesn't really make sense.
[30/11/2022, 01:01:41] Alex Regueiro: It's one of those messy phenomena where many factors are surely at play.
[30/11/2022, 01:01:51] Alice Lafferty: Very diplomatic of you
[30/11/2022, 01:01:52] Alex Regueiro: But they all do, to varying degrees.
[30/11/2022, 01:02:04] Alex Regueiro: I know, I'm great at fence-sitting. But I have to here!
[30/11/2022, 01:02:14] Alice Lafferty: Yes but have read claims that divorce is 'the absolute worst'.
[30/11/2022, 01:02:17] Alice Lafferty: Out of these
[30/11/2022, 01:02:22] Alex Regueiro: The anecdotal evidence in favour of it is also shouting inside my head.
[30/11/2022, 01:02:54] Alice Lafferty: Very interesting, anecdotally I have observed the opposite!
[30/11/2022, 01:04:27] Alice Lafferty: Know lots of people from quite complicated families who are doing very well, and vice versa. There's no correlation in my experience, but of course, that doesn't prove anything.
[30/11/2022, 01:04:30] Alex Regueiro: I mean, is it really so implausible that the separation of your parents, to which you have an immense inbuilt  psychological bond, if suddenly imposed on you in your early childhood (say, pre-adolescence), would cause serious psychological scarring? I don't think it is.
[30/11/2022, 01:05:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes it is implausible - because for most of human history fathers were not involved in their child rearing at all!
[30/11/2022, 01:05:11] Alex Regueiro: I have a few examples among cousins and friends, but yes, small sample size
[30/11/2022, 01:05:30] Alice Lafferty: *separation from the mother in infancy... is a different matter altogether.
[30/11/2022, 01:05:29] Alex Regueiro: I don't think that's true... depends how far back you extend human history though!
[30/11/2022, 01:05:56] Alex Regueiro: We can agree that (early) separation from the mother is more traumatic though.
[30/11/2022, 01:06:25] Alex Regueiro: Ironically my grandfather was a wonderful counterexample to my point, and his brother a wonderful example in favour.
[30/11/2022, 01:06:38] Alice Lafferty: I don't know when paternal investment in children became commonplace, but think about the exact nature of that investment.
[30/11/2022, 01:07:04] Alice Lafferty: It wouldn't have been like immediate, affective bond like the maternal relationship.
[30/11/2022, 01:07:19] Alice Lafferty: 'Investment' might just mean bringing food home.
[30/11/2022, 01:07:29] Alex Regueiro: It's more indirect for the most part, absolutely
[30/11/2022, 01:08:46] Alex Regueiro: But in premodern society when the father could provide food and shelter and protection, that would free up the mother enormously to raise the children well. And the father would almost always play some role in the raising of children after a certain age. I definitely believe in the benefit of a good father figure for both boys and girls, even if it might be overstated.
[30/11/2022, 01:08:57] Alice Lafferty: Unfortunately my dad is not. He was adopted at ~6 weeks and with all due to respect to him, remains at 56 uncomfortable with expressing affection.
[30/11/2022, 01:09:15] Alice Lafferty: *beyond what you should expect of a 'normal' English man.
[30/11/2022, 01:09:23] Alex Regueiro: Heh, good qualifier
[30/11/2022, 01:10:07] Alice Lafferty: If your dad pays child support and you seem him at the weekend or whatever, is that really so different from normal paternal involvement for most of civilisational history...
[30/11/2022, 01:10:19] Alex Regueiro: That's unfortunate indeed, but probably not uncommon, and probably more a consequence of not having a mother present in his earliest years (when the father is almost totally irrelevant in terms of direct influence on the child).
[30/11/2022, 01:10:54] Alice Lafferty: I won't say anymore because I feel as though I'm talking about him behind his back. But yes I think the effect is unmistakable.
[30/11/2022, 01:12:25] Alex Regueiro: Even if you don't, and you have a good stepfather, that's probably very nearly as good as having a good biological father there to raise you. But I do think some masculine psychological influence (and transferral of memes) can be highly beneficial. On the other end, potentially very detrimental (if the father is abusive or highly aggressive for example), but I think the mean outcome is still positive.
[30/11/2022, 01:12:35] Alice Lafferty: Well, anyway, I just wanted to push back a tiny bit against the conservative narrative about 'single mothers!!!!!'
[30/11/2022, 01:12:44] Alex Regueiro: That's fair. I'm much freer to speak about the dead here!@
[30/11/2022, 01:13:21] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough, my granddad lost his mother at age ~4, and his brother at age ~7, and it was his brother who was far more effected. But I'm sure that a good portion of that was genetic.
[30/11/2022, 01:13:29] Alice Lafferty: I think introducing a man who is not your child's biological father into your household is one of the worst things you can do. With some exceptions obviously.
[30/11/2022, 01:13:44] Alex Regueiro: They both got beaten by nuns at a convent orphanage for years...
[30/11/2022, 01:14:47] Alex Regueiro: It's risky as hell. What I meant is that if he treats his stepchildren like his own, then I think that is very nearly as good as the biological father helping raise them. Big if though, possibly!
[30/11/2022, 01:15:44] Alice Lafferty: Right... how common childhood exposure to death, violence, abuse, starvation was.. have to assume most people who ever lived were to some degree 'traumatised'.
[30/11/2022, 01:16:00] Alice Lafferty: Or you have to recalibrate what 'trauma' means.
[30/11/2022, 01:16:08] Alex Regueiro: affected* (damnit)
[30/11/2022, 01:16:32] Alex Regueiro: I think people/society have recalibrated enormously what trauma means over the last 200 years, say
[30/11/2022, 01:16:35] Alice Lafferty: Was this in Ireland?
[30/11/2022, 01:16:56] Alex Regueiro: Try explaining "microaggressions" or "trigger warnings" to an 18th century peasant!
[30/11/2022, 01:17:02] Alex Regueiro: New York City
[30/11/2022, 01:17:29] Alex Regueiro: probably Irish nuns for the most part though...
[30/11/2022, 01:17:55] Alex Regueiro: Did your dad have a similar experience?
[30/11/2022, 01:18:12] Alex Regueiro: Or was he adopted early on?
[30/11/2022, 01:18:14] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I'm being nosy...
[30/11/2022, 01:18:17] Alice Lafferty: My mum never told me she was proud of me - trauma. I watched three of my siblings die of dysentery and my mother starve to death - ?
[30/11/2022, 01:18:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting.
[30/11/2022, 01:18:34] Alex Regueiro: hah right
[30/11/2022, 01:19:09] Alice Lafferty: I don't have a good account for why they were so specifically cruel.
[30/11/2022, 01:19:24] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe they weren't - and they're just the only ones we know about.
[30/11/2022, 01:19:41] Alex Regueiro: At the same time, it's not like human emotions and grief were fundamentally different. His mother lost several children to miscarriage and disease due to poor living conditions and other factors... We know it was traumatic for her. And who can rightly say it shouldn't be, at any point in human history.
[30/11/2022, 01:20:26] Alice Lafferty: He was adopted as a baby so no, fortunately. But he was born in that kind of institution, and adopted via the Catholic Children's Society in Dublin.
[30/11/2022, 01:20:33] Alice Lafferty: So he was lucky in a way.
[30/11/2022, 01:20:38] Alex Regueiro: Who knows... I can't help but think it's partly selection bias though. That is, the sort of women (in the 20th C) that is drawn towards a life in a convent.
[30/11/2022, 01:20:46] Alice Lafferty: I believe they practised very early infant-mother separation though.
[30/11/2022, 01:20:57] Alex Regueiro: Well I'm glad to hear that much at least.
[30/11/2022, 01:21:00] Alex Regueiro: I see
[30/11/2022, 01:21:46] Alex Regueiro: That's harmful even at a physiological level, I believe. (We're not so different from cattle, after all!)
[30/11/2022, 01:21:54] Alex Regueiro: potentially harmful, at least
[30/11/2022, 01:22:27] Alice Lafferty: Of course. I don't understand how most people who ever lived were not totally deranged from suffering.
[30/11/2022, 01:23:17] Alice Lafferty: I think so. Long-term stress (which that would have caused) makes long-term neurobiological imprints.
[30/11/2022, 01:23:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, nor do I. Sheer necessity of the circumstances, I suppose. But a lot of people must have still lost the plot, and justifiably so. Survival of the fittest was really doing overtime back then, you could say.
[30/11/2022, 01:23:40] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[30/11/2022, 01:24:06] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes good point.
[30/11/2022, 01:24:21] Alex Regueiro: Well, at least we can both be grateful for growing up with caring mothers, it sounds like! And parents who stayed together, to boot.
[30/11/2022, 01:24:43] Alice Lafferty: I think it was Mary Gaitskill again actually who suggested nuns were vicious towards promiscuous women due to sublimated jealousy or something.
[30/11/2022, 01:24:46] Alex Regueiro: A rare gift, in this day and age....
[30/11/2022, 01:25:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes, you're right.
[30/11/2022, 01:25:10] Alex Regueiro: I mean, that's not implausible...
[30/11/2022, 01:25:49] Alice Lafferty: And it is very easy for me to sit here, a product of a conventional nuclear family, and say that your parents getting divorced is no big deal.
[30/11/2022, 01:25:53] Alex Regueiro: My granddad said there were literally just two nuns who were kind to him, out of the lot. The rest raised from callous to borderline sadistic.
[30/11/2022, 01:26:38] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. In truth there's enormous variation both amongst children with our sort of comfortable upbringing, and the most traumatic ones.
[30/11/2022, 01:27:05] Alice Lafferty: God. And you say he seems okay in spite of it all?
[30/11/2022, 01:27:25] Alice Lafferty: Education seemed to attract these personality types too right.
[30/11/2022, 01:27:31] Alex Regueiro: I don't even know what level of correlation we're talking about. And "welfare" is so multidimensional anyway. Okay, I'm being really dull and noncommital agian...
[30/11/2022, 01:28:26] Alex Regueiro: Seemed, but yeah, certainly was. I mean, he had a wonderful life in multiple ways despite all this shit when he was a child. A large chunk of it was sheer good fortune though, I imagine.
[30/11/2022, 01:28:40] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean?
[30/11/2022, 01:28:52] Alice Lafferty: All the same do you think there's any harmful effects incurred from living in a household where your parents visibly detested each other?
[30/11/2022, 01:30:13] Alice Lafferty: Well that's good to hear. Resilience to trauma would be good gene group to isolate...
[30/11/2022, 01:30:41] Alice Lafferty: I mean the prolific use of corporal punishment in schools.
[30/11/2022, 01:31:04] Alex Regueiro: I'd be very surprised if there weren't, unless you were highly resilient and had other benign influences outside. As children we strongly internalise ideas about appropriate emotional response and how relationships work from the people close to us. I'm reluctant to downplay "nurture" in most cases, even if I'm a big believer in genetic effects all the same.
[30/11/2022, 01:32:02] Alice Lafferty: This is a good point.
[30/11/2022, 01:32:01] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. I don't even know if I have it, as comparatively I've had very little trauma to face.
[30/11/2022, 01:32:18] Alex Regueiro: Oh right, yes.
[30/11/2022, 01:32:32] Alex Regueiro: All jobs need a few perks though, right?
[30/11/2022, 01:32:40] Alice Lafferty: It's a terrifying responsibility to have a child!
[30/11/2022, 01:33:32] Alex Regueiro: It is, especially for mothers. I reckon it's super easy to overestimate the reward and underestimate the burden, but also vice versa.
[30/11/2022, 01:33:44] Alice Lafferty: Me neither, I've been very lucky, and yet... I'm kind of dysfunctional in lots of ways.
[30/11/2022, 01:34:35] Alice Lafferty: Sometimes I attribute it to having a sibling born very soon after me and being like usurped and having to compete for attention.
[30/11/2022, 01:34:38] Alex Regueiro: Before I forget, here's another music recommendation. It came up on shuffle yesterday and thought you might enjoy it! Do tell me to stop my recommendations if I'm getting annoying though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITRsdq9SQS4
[30/11/2022, 01:35:02] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I'm not going to continue navel gazing!
[30/11/2022, 01:35:07] Alex Regueiro: Ooh, I'm going to use that excuse too
[30/11/2022, 01:35:14] Alice Lafferty: And forcing you to listen
[30/11/2022, 01:35:23] Alice Lafferty: It's a really bad habit.
[30/11/2022, 01:35:34] Alex Regueiro: I've actually heard of it... but never gave it much attention.
[30/11/2022, 01:35:36] Alice Lafferty: What is the age gap between you and your sister?
[30/11/2022, 01:36:01] Alice Lafferty: Thank you. Added to my watch later. It's not annoying.
[30/11/2022, 01:36:00] Alex Regueiro: My mum was lucky she was the 5th of 6 and there was a four year gap before her younger brother. (He was an accident and he knows it hah.)
[30/11/2022, 01:36:11] Alex Regueiro: 22 months
[30/11/2022, 01:36:14] Alex Regueiro: So not super short but...
[30/11/2022, 01:36:37] Alice Lafferty: The youngest sibling(s) are always super coddled!
[30/11/2022, 01:37:29] Alice Lafferty: You still would have been under 2, so very impressionable. I was 13 months when my brother was born.
[30/11/2022, 01:37:47] Alex Regueiro: Don't worry. I mean, it's pretty interesting hearing you muse about your life in a way. You've not overdone it... yet! (All the same, I admire self-awareness.)
[30/11/2022, 01:38:23] Alex Regueiro: Yeah you got short changed in terms of having mum all to yourself!
[30/11/2022, 01:38:53] Alex Regueiro: I've heard quite a few stereotypes about eldest/youngest/middle children and I must say, the folk wisdom does have something to it...
[30/11/2022, 01:39:09] Alice Lafferty: Ok, you can tell me when it does! It's good to talk these things out... I am trying to think a bit more objectively about why I struggle with some things so much. Short of going to therapy.
[30/11/2022, 01:39:13] Alice Lafferty: Or could just be autism.
[30/11/2022, 01:39:58] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Now this may gross you out but I believe in pre-modern human groups mothers would often nurse infants until 2-3 years old.
[30/11/2022, 01:40:07] Alex Regueiro: Eldest are meant to be more likely to be big successes... I would amend that to: either big successes or big flops, but rarely anywhere in-between. And the younger ones are meant to be more emotionally stable but less ambitious/successful, I think?
[30/11/2022, 01:40:28] Alice Lafferty: And breastfeeding induces anovulation, preventing further pregnancies during that time period.
[30/11/2022, 01:40:39] Alice Lafferty: So maybe something to be said for larger gaps between children.
[30/11/2022, 01:40:47] Alex Regueiro: It's a little gross but... kind of makes sense, I suppose? I recall hearing some contemporary cases of that, which does gross me out.
[30/11/2022, 01:41:30] Alex Regueiro: Well, I'm no therapist, but if it's any reassurance, I'm sure I've gone through some of the same struggles and thought processes before. üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 01:41:32] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I'm not sure whether these differences ever play out in a statistically significant way but it is very interesting.
[30/11/2022, 01:42:09] Alice Lafferty: Interestingly my middle brother is the most stable, happy and well-adjusted of my family.
[30/11/2022, 01:42:12] Alex Regueiro: Quite possibly. Might be less taxing on the mother both physically and emotionally, too? I know it's really risky if the gap between children is less than 11 or even 12 months.
[30/11/2022, 01:42:56] Alice Lafferty: Yes, definitely.
[30/11/2022, 01:43:31] Alice Lafferty: I cannot imagine the physical toll of carrying >10 pregnancies...
[30/11/2022, 01:43:42] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. My father is the middle of three, and he turned out the most stable and certainly most successful. But (and I say this not to disparage him in the slightest), he clearly still has issues from development. Things he never quite learned.
[30/11/2022, 01:43:55] Alex Regueiro: Yep, brutal. Wouldn't wish it on anyone.
[30/11/2022, 01:44:39] Alice Lafferty: Really, what sort of things? (if you don't mind?)
[30/11/2022, 01:45:05] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I love my father, he's a great man in so many ways. But I do reckon there are certain things we all fail to learn to some extent, during development. Or else it may be a genetic predisposition.
[30/11/2022, 01:45:15] Alex Regueiro: In his case possibly because he rushed through school and university at such a young age
[30/11/2022, 01:45:56] Alice Lafferty: Of course.
[30/11/2022, 01:45:59] Alex Regueiro: Ability to read social situations and pick up on certain cues, for one...
[30/11/2022, 01:46:11] Alice Lafferty: ?
[30/11/2022, 01:46:34] Alice Lafferty: Every single thing you've said about your father so far could well apply to mine.
[30/11/2022, 01:47:07] Alice Lafferty: But as you said not bad enough to affect his professional life?
[30/11/2022, 01:47:24] Alex Regueiro: Hah really? Part of me is really curious if they'd get along. I know we joked before they'd both enjoy reminiscing about Thatcher and griping about Tube strikes!
[30/11/2022, 01:47:39] Alice Lafferty: Or personal life either? I mean he basically has had a successful career and marriage? Which is more than a lot of people can say.
[30/11/2022, 01:47:41] Alex Regueiro: He was very successful in his job, though possibly it prevented him going into higher management...
[30/11/2022, 01:47:55] Alex Regueiro: A lot of it could just be his personality though.
[30/11/2022, 01:48:15] Alex Regueiro: I have some of the same neuroticisms he has. And strengths too, I'd hope.
[30/11/2022, 01:48:22] Alex Regueiro: ?
[30/11/2022, 01:49:04] Alice Lafferty: To be honest a degree of male-pattern social inhibition is normal, but I guess this went beyond that?
[30/11/2022, 01:49:52] Alice Lafferty: Don't want to say the A-word either because I sound like a broken record but..
[30/11/2022, 01:50:05] Alex Regueiro: It's not so such inhibition as he just didn't fully learn the social conventions. He's actually quite extroverted. At least compared to my mum or to me.
[30/11/2022, 01:50:22] Alex Regueiro: I feel a bit bad saying these things though... hope I'm not doing him a disservice.
[30/11/2022, 01:50:31] Alice Lafferty: Right
[30/11/2022, 01:50:37] Alice Lafferty: Ah I see.
[30/11/2022, 01:51:11] Alex Regueiro: Can I say, I feel oddly comfortable talking to you about things I wouldn't normally share with someone so readily. Oddly... but maybe it's a good thing? I don't mind sharing any of it, I'm just self-reflecting here.
[30/11/2022, 01:51:21] Alice Lafferty: Haha, that's how I felt too. You don't have to say anymore if you don't want to, but I think what you've sketched of him has been very sensitive.
[30/11/2022, 01:51:37] Alex Regueiro: Okay, thanks üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 01:51:59] Alex Regueiro: I try to be. My relationship with him is one of paradoxes.
[30/11/2022, 01:52:40] Alice Lafferty: That's probably because I shared compromising information about myself first.
[30/11/2022, 01:53:32] Alice Lafferty: So we're not going to hold/use it against each other or something.
[30/11/2022, 01:53:42] Alex Regueiro: Oh, you wanted me to elaborate I suppose? I'm flitting over things. He went to university at 14, and rushed through 3 degrees (as he changed course away from music). Not saying this to boast, but perhaps it gives him a good excuse as he didn't go through the same process of social maturation most teenagers go through.
[30/11/2022, 01:54:02] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's definitely part of it. It's sort of disarming, in a nice way!
[30/11/2022, 01:54:23] Alice Lafferty: That is often the way...
[30/11/2022, 01:54:25] Alex Regueiro: I'm not necessarily close off normally, but nor am I warm and fuzzy.
[30/11/2022, 01:54:39] Alex Regueiro: Or particularly disposed to sharing personal things, even
[30/11/2022, 01:54:51] Alice Lafferty: Hopefully basically not antagonistic though?
[30/11/2022, 01:55:03] Alex Regueiro: I love how our discussions always turn meta after a point haha
[30/11/2022, 01:55:33] Alice Lafferty: 14?? Why did skip so many school years?
[30/11/2022, 01:55:41] Alice Lafferty: That definitely explains a lot!
[30/11/2022, 01:55:43] Alex Regueiro: We've had our fair share of conflict, but all fathers and sons due to an extent I reckon, especially when they're around each other too much. In some ways we're too similar! In other ways too different.
[30/11/2022, 01:55:52] Alex Regueiro: Yep. He was a bit of a musical prodigy.
[30/11/2022, 01:56:12] Alex Regueiro: And his father pushed him too, you could say...
[30/11/2022, 01:56:17] Alice Lafferty: I can't imagine at 14 being thrust into a social environment of 18 year olds.. poor him.
[30/11/2022, 01:56:36] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Though skipping years in the US is more common, especially back then.
[30/11/2022, 01:56:45] Alex Regueiro: Some of it was self-inflicted... but yeah, I agree.
[30/11/2022, 01:56:57] Alex Regueiro: that is, very much his own choice
[30/11/2022, 01:57:17] Alice Lafferty: Me neither. I rarely discuss emotions with my parents because my mother is (bless her) extremely intense prone to tears, and my dad for reasons already stated.
[30/11/2022, 01:57:57] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. These seem like total opposites emotionally. Politically opposites too? Albeit neither seems extreme/radical.
[30/11/2022, 01:58:02] Alice Lafferty: It's good to talk to someone who you're acquainted with but there's not that messy painful aspect of intense mutual emotional investment, as there is with parents.
[30/11/2022, 01:58:29] Alice Lafferty: Right.
[30/11/2022, 01:59:13] Alice Lafferty: From music how did he get into banking?
[30/11/2022, 01:59:52] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I'll be honest, that "messy painful aspect of intense mutual emotional investment" is one of the reasons I was so wary of getting involved in anything romantic for long periods...
[30/11/2022, 02:00:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes! They're like extreme versions of classic male/female emotional types.
[30/11/2022, 02:00:03] Alex Regueiro: So much easier with friends. Or siblings even
[30/11/2022, 02:00:23] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. That was sort of my thought.
[30/11/2022, 02:00:32] Alex Regueiro: My parents are a bit different in that sense...
[30/11/2022, 02:01:10] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Although to be honest I can't imagine ever being as emotionally entangled in the way I am with my parents.
[30/11/2022, 02:01:33] Alice Lafferty: Are you close with your sister?
[30/11/2022, 02:02:46] Alex Regueiro: At 18 (done his music master's then), his main teacher, whom he really respect told him not to pursue a career as a concert pianist unless he saw it as his only path in life. Maybe the teacher was a bit jaded, but I think my dad was having second thoughts anyway, and rebelling a little against his very focused childhood and whatnot. Or maybe just the idea of a comfortable high-earning job started appealing to him. Rather than travelling the world, performing, and worrying where your next paycheck is coming from. (Very very few classical musicians have a comfortable living, and it's also difficult to start a family, not that he was thinking about that at 18.)
[30/11/2022, 02:03:06] Alex Regueiro: Reasonably. As close as we can be living on different continents!
[30/11/2022, 02:03:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, romance is a very different sort of love. I think we talked about this before. But we can probably agree it's a messy entanglement all the same.
[30/11/2022, 02:03:43] Alex Regueiro: And being incredibly different personalities
[30/11/2022, 02:03:51] Alex Regueiro: How about you and your brothers?
[30/11/2022, 02:04:25] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. I was wondering about that pianist we saw at SJSS, whether she earned a living off of those kind of concerts.
[30/11/2022, 02:05:16] Alice Lafferty: If she does then she's one of very few. That's a shame though... does he have any regrets about not pursuing music or?
[30/11/2022, 02:05:51] Alex Regueiro: She was professional I'm pretty sure. So yeah. They usually have to teach on the side too, whether they like it or not.
[30/11/2022, 02:06:09] Alex Regueiro: She?
[30/11/2022, 02:06:52] Alice Lafferty: That's good. Me and my younger brother have really strikingly similar personalities. Whereas my middle brother is kind of a """normie""", I'm using that word at least semi-ironically. But he's also great!
[30/11/2022, 02:06:58] Alex Regueiro: He doesn't have too many regrets, even though I sometimes joke he sold his soul... His father was very disappointed, to some extent until the day he died. Though he very decently kept them to himself almost entirely.
[30/11/2022, 02:07:06] Alice Lafferty: *she (the pianist)
[30/11/2022, 02:07:19] Alex Regueiro: Oh, of course, yes...
[30/11/2022, 02:07:38] Alice Lafferty: That's interesting that his father was disappointed that he entered a highly lucrative career!
[30/11/2022, 02:07:45] Alex Regueiro: I mean, there are thousands, but the great majority don't make any more money than a decent plumber, and have a hectic and stressful schedule
[30/11/2022, 02:08:48] Alex Regueiro: I think because he *had* to earn a good living given his upbringing and the few opportunities that came his way at first. Circumstances almost forced him to be a conventional success in life or a complete failure. But as he told me several times, if he had a chance to go back and do everything over again (and no constraints), he would have been a physicist rather than an engineer.
[30/11/2022, 02:08:50] Alice Lafferty: Eh but I don't believe another person will truly ever see me as an end rather than a means.
[30/11/2022, 02:09:36] Alice Lafferty: It's a shame its not better paid because it means a lot of intelligent, creative people are drawn out of music and into banking/law or whatever (like your father).
[30/11/2022, 02:09:46] Alex Regueiro: So he really wanted his son to pursue his passion and talent. Of course, my dad had plenty of talent for finance too (as a salesman), but it's only fair to see it as a more pragmatic and less romantic/idealistic vocation.
[30/11/2022, 02:10:17] Alex Regueiro: It is... And the same can be said of many other noble career paths that just don't pay (except for a lucky handful)
[30/11/2022, 02:11:08] Alice Lafferty: I see. This has clarified things a bit. I guess he was very pleased when you did a physics degree then?
[30/11/2022, 02:11:18] Alice Lafferty: *your grandfather
[30/11/2022, 02:11:19] Alex Regueiro: That made me cry a little inside. Do you really think that?
[30/11/2022, 02:11:41] Alex Regueiro: Just that it would really depress me to live that way. Even if I have felt like that at moments.
[30/11/2022, 02:11:52] Alice Lafferty: Oh I didn't mean it in a self-pitying way! I'm quite all right with that.
[30/11/2022, 02:12:33] Alex Regueiro: I don't actually remember his reaction. He had a severe stroke soon after I went off to uni... I think that was the timing?
[30/11/2022, 02:12:58] Alice Lafferty: I mean, any pain that I feel my mother genuinely experiences it empathetically as if it was inflicted on herself. That's how invested she is in me.
[30/11/2022, 02:13:11] Alice Lafferty: I really don't expect or even particularly want that from another person.
[30/11/2022, 02:13:41] Alice Lafferty: It would be better if we had a good patronage system.
[30/11/2022, 02:13:53] Alice Lafferty: Oh that's a shame.
[30/11/2022, 02:13:55] Alex Regueiro: Okay, but I hope you will believe me when I say I don't think of you remotely as a means. Or my other good friends. I mean, we haven't known each other that long, but I would at least call a friend now.
[30/11/2022, 02:14:19] Alex Regueiro: And not just because I've studied Kant and like like the Kingdom of Ends!
[30/11/2022, 02:14:50] Alice Lafferty: This is very kind, but probably all people instrumentalise each other to some extent? Even in really benevolent ways?
[30/11/2022, 02:14:57] Alex Regueiro: I've often thought of that. Large corporations and government bodies have sort of taken over this role, to some extent. It's really not the same though. Not when it comes to individual patronage.
[30/11/2022, 02:15:18] Alice Lafferty: They take it over and then refuse to allocate funds to it.
[30/11/2022, 02:15:39] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps it's built into us. It could be said all altruism is ultimately self-beneficial, but I don't think that diminishes it in any way.
[30/11/2022, 02:15:41] Alice Lafferty: We need like a Medici type family to fund wonderful cathedrals.
[30/11/2022, 02:15:48] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah
[30/11/2022, 02:15:52] Alex Regueiro: We really do
[30/11/2022, 02:16:07] Alex Regueiro: One of the great advantages of having super-rich elites!
[30/11/2022, 02:16:27] Alice Lafferty: Actually friendships might be less suceptible to this than romantic relationships. Maybe it's really the superior form
[30/11/2022, 02:16:42] Alex Regueiro: Albeit not brutally materialistic deracinated ones like we tend to get these days. Whose only return to the community is really a form of narcissism (philanthropy, etc.)
[30/11/2022, 02:16:59] Alex Regueiro: Not that it wasn't in the past, but they had genuine ties to their communities and cultures back then
[30/11/2022, 02:17:40] Alice Lafferty: Yes to be fair some of those Victorian industrialists commissioned some pretty nice buildings and artworks.
[30/11/2022, 02:17:47] Alex Regueiro: Even if they don't, it seems very superficial. Corporate sponsorship, I'm thinking of
[30/11/2022, 02:18:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Carnegie Hall is a prime example, speaking of music!
[30/11/2022, 02:18:16] Alice Lafferty: I don't know why that stopped. Like Jeff Bezos sank billions into that Lord of the Rings adaptation but it was... not that good?
[30/11/2022, 02:18:18] Alex Regueiro: Wigmore Hall might be too even?
[30/11/2022, 02:18:50] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure.
[30/11/2022, 02:19:03] Alex Regueiro: It might well be. There's something a lot safer and more comfortable about them. But also less rewarding?
[30/11/2022, 02:19:11] Alex Regueiro: Either way, that's no invitation to double friend-zone me! üòâ
[30/11/2022, 02:19:47] Alex Regueiro: I read the reviews and saw the trailers, and frankly it's an abomination and an insult to Tolkien's artistic legacy. I won't say anything more, even though I easily could...
[30/11/2022, 02:20:35] Alex Regueiro: Artistic, moral, cultural, and aesthetic legacy. There. I'm not mincing my words, am I?
[30/11/2022, 02:21:21] Alice Lafferty: Probably because of the sexual element in romantic relationships, there's a huge degree of vulnerability, and it's more difficult to act truly altruistically as a consequence.
[30/11/2022, 02:22:10] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's reasonable. Interestingly more and more people seem to be detaching the sex from romance these days. Not sure how well it works but... why not.
[30/11/2022, 02:22:36] Alice Lafferty: ! Most of what I say is just speculation and has no bearing on real life events
[30/11/2022, 02:22:58] Alex Regueiro: Here's a plug for my friend (from the salon). He's no Tolkien nerd like me, but still... https://www.spiked-online.com/2022/09/14/the-rings-of-power-is-an-insult-to-fans/
[30/11/2022, 02:23:14] Alex Regueiro: That was 95% a joke, to be clear!
[30/11/2022, 02:23:34] Alice Lafferty: Haha your friend is a journalist at spiked?
[30/11/2022, 02:23:34] Alex Regueiro: And I know, our discussion has been pretty meta for a while already. üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 02:23:37] Alex Regueiro: yep
[30/11/2022, 02:23:40] Alex Regueiro: intern for now
[30/11/2022, 02:24:22] Alice Lafferty: Ha interesting.
[30/11/2022, 02:24:27] Alex Regueiro: I've met quite a few people in the (anti-establishment) journalistic world through it and similar events, actually!
[30/11/2022, 02:24:34] Alex Regueiro: Despite it being far removed from my own world
[30/11/2022, 02:26:04] Alice Lafferty: Maybe this is more honest. In some ways the historical attempts to marry the two was always basically a falsification.
[30/11/2022, 02:26:41] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, I think they're fairly prominent now, along with unherd.
[30/11/2022, 02:26:47] Alex Regueiro: So the (co-)founder of the salon (though she didn't really do much beyond help brainstorm it I think?) is Inaya Folarin Imam. She founded Free Speech Champinos, among other things, and she's a fairly well-known young journalist. Had a show on GB News for a while, and has written for all sorts of publications, including Spiked, but also major newspapers occasionally. She occasionally comes to the salons.
[30/11/2022, 02:26:51] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[30/11/2022, 02:27:09] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to an Unherd party (all the salon was invited) on the 15th actually.
[30/11/2022, 02:27:24] Alice Lafferty: Oh that's cool. I'm going to look her up.
[30/11/2022, 02:28:00] Alex Regueiro: It could well be. I'm still not sure to be honest. But there's at least a modicum of evidence you can have romance without sex, I'd say...
[30/11/2022, 02:28:22] Alice Lafferty: Very nice...! Have a sneaking suspicion those journalists are poised to take over as the regnant media class.
[30/11/2022, 02:28:42] Alex Regueiro: Do. She's an interesting young woman who's made a very bright start to her career.
[30/11/2022, 02:28:43] Alice Lafferty: Unherd publishes some really great writers.
[30/11/2022, 02:29:13] Alice Lafferty: That entire scene is just so much more intellectually vibrant than the Guardian/progressives.
[30/11/2022, 02:29:38] Alice Lafferty: People will move towards the novel. A 'vibe shift' if you will.
[30/11/2022, 02:30:00] Alex Regueiro: Hah, if only... I suspect they'll remain the dissidents for some time yet. The "march through the institutions" by the neo-progressives was completed some years ago. So that subsumes almost all mainstream culture.
[30/11/2022, 02:30:23] Alice Lafferty: Right exactly. It's already mainstream and getting stale.
[30/11/2022, 02:31:02] Alice Lafferty: There's an entry position for a sexy new wave ideology with its attendant journalists, books, magazines etc.
[30/11/2022, 02:31:04] Alex Regueiro: This is true. And I feel the sort of "Times centrist" space is equally dead and desiccated. (Even if they still publish great cryptics, sorry!)
[30/11/2022, 02:31:26] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. It's already begun, you could say... long way off becoming dominant, mind you.
[30/11/2022, 02:31:57] Alice Lafferty: The columnists in the Times are completely of touch. They're all in their sixties and still banging on about Blair and Islamic terrorism or whatever. It's like a timewarp to 2005.
[30/11/2022, 02:31:59] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, you're welcome to come to that too... though no pressure.
[30/11/2022, 02:32:13] Alice Lafferty: But I loyally do the crosswords yes..
[30/11/2022, 02:32:15] Alex Regueiro: Haha exactly
[30/11/2022, 02:33:14] Alice Lafferty: It is/will attract youth during the 2020s, becoming mainstream by 2030ish. That's my 2 cents anyway.
[30/11/2022, 02:33:16] Alex Regueiro: At least it's still more genuinely centrist than the BBC, but still...
[30/11/2022, 02:33:56] Alex Regueiro: I won't gainsay you. You're more "optimistic" than me but yeah, it's possible.
[30/11/2022, 02:34:30] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure if it's always been like this but at the moment the Times has a pretty explicit centre-right bent.
[30/11/2022, 02:34:32] Alex Regueiro: "2 cents". That damn American cultural hegemony will take longer to undo though. üò§
[30/11/2022, 02:35:07] Alice Lafferty: I watch the BBC sometimes and I don't see a huge left bias - with the big exception of their coverage of US news.
[30/11/2022, 02:35:14] Alex Regueiro: I got the impression there's been a shift towards centre-left in recent years, no? I sort of picture it as centre-centre, with a little either side.
[30/11/2022, 02:35:26] Alice Lafferty: Haha. What can I say? Two pennies??
[30/11/2022, 02:35:42] Alex Regueiro: It depends very much on the topic. Sometimes it's obvious, sometimes they do a good impression of impartiality still.
[30/11/2022, 02:35:48] Alex Regueiro: Damn right.
[30/11/2022, 02:35:53] Alex Regueiro: üá¨üáß
[30/11/2022, 02:36:06] Alex Regueiro: Rule Britannia!
[30/11/2022, 02:36:34] Alice Lafferty: I mean, not really. They have pretty hawkish Ukraine coverage, publish lots of 'the damn wokes' type of content.
[30/11/2022, 02:36:42] Alex Regueiro: Telegraph was traditionally the centre-right one I reckon, these days it's a mix of centre-right and plain "right".
[30/11/2022, 02:36:54] Alice Lafferty: It's aligned with the Spectator, I'd say.
[30/11/2022, 02:36:56] Alex Regueiro: Fair enough. You know it much better than me!
[30/11/2022, 02:37:08] Alex Regueiro: I always think of the Telegraph as more aligned with the Speccie...
[30/11/2022, 02:37:11] Alex Regueiro: certainly in terms of editors
[30/11/2022, 02:37:39] Alice Lafferty: Honestly? Flipping through the Times and the Telegraph, the centre/centre-right distinction doesn't exist in reality.
[30/11/2022, 02:38:07] Alice Lafferty: I don't know why we even bother discussing these old media pubs.
[30/11/2022, 02:38:08] Alex Regueiro: There's a lot of common ground between the two, as far as I can tell, though the Telegraph is a little more rightist?
[30/11/2022, 02:38:16] Alice Lafferty: They have little bearing on anything!
[30/11/2022, 02:38:26] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, like I've said before, I hate the (1D) political spectrum, so enough of this.
[30/11/2022, 02:38:30] Alice Lafferty: Yea maybe. I'm not a regular reader to be fair.
[30/11/2022, 02:38:42] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. As
[30/11/2022, 02:38:48] Alex Regueiro: Your parents are though I take it?
[30/11/2022, 02:39:32] Alice Lafferty: True. Ok a more subtle distinction is that the Times is more libertarian and the Telegraph is maybe more traditionalist.
[30/11/2022, 02:39:47] Alex Regueiro: That's fair
[30/11/2022, 02:39:49] Alice Lafferty: Yes my dad buys the Times every day and brings it home for me to read.
[30/11/2022, 02:40:28] Alex Regueiro: Or the Times is classical liberal at least. Libertarian might be too strong. The Telegraph mixes classical liberalism and traditional conservatism more, perhaps.
[30/11/2022, 02:40:40] Alex Regueiro: By "read", you mean do the cryptic?
[30/11/2022, 02:40:50] Alex Regueiro: What a kind father, anyway. üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 02:41:06] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I use libertarian and classic lib interchangeably although maybe I shouldn't.
[30/11/2022, 02:41:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes, and I skim the articles too and read if there's something interesting.
[30/11/2022, 02:41:31] Alex Regueiro: The distinction is more a matter of degree than qualitative, but yeah...
[30/11/2022, 02:41:57] Alice Lafferty: They often do quaint little stories like 'woman bakes cake in the shape of her dog' or something.
[30/11/2022, 02:42:50] Alice Lafferty: I know that doesn't sound newsworthy but literally.
[30/11/2022, 02:42:52] Alex Regueiro: I wouldn't begrudge you not looking at the news content to be honest, even though I teased. I stopped following the news religiously years ago. Just don't find it psychologically beneficial, or even practically to be fair.
[30/11/2022, 02:43:07] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[30/11/2022, 02:43:10] Alex Regueiro: Fell good stories
[30/11/2022, 02:43:17] Alex Regueiro: There's a lot of demand for them!
[30/11/2022, 02:44:00] Alex Regueiro: There's even an app for them (in the broad sense) called "Good News Network".
[30/11/2022, 02:44:46] Alice Lafferty: I browse the Guardian or BBC news, I guess because I'd feel embarrassed if something came up in discussion and I couldn't follow.
[30/11/2022, 02:45:03] Alex Regueiro: In light of what I just said, I don't blame you at all for turning to such stories. Though I do get slightly miffed when they occupy too much of the news headlines!
[30/11/2022, 02:45:34] Alex Regueiro: I used to feel this way. I had (still have to an extent) a massive security about being ignorant of the world. It's probably why I got good at general knowledge!
[30/11/2022, 02:46:03] Alice Lafferty: But you must have a bit of an idea if you read the Spectator, unherd or whatever?
[30/11/2022, 02:46:26] Alice Lafferty: They tend to comment on whatevr's in the news cycle.
[30/11/2022, 02:46:57] Alice Lafferty: It's ok! I think they're sweet and harmless, and usually tucked away in the back pages so it's fine.
[30/11/2022, 02:47:14] Alex Regueiro: I mainly read online articles these days. Spiked, Unherd, Spectator, Telegraph, the odd BBC/Guardian/Times one.
[30/11/2022, 02:47:45] Alice Lafferty: The Time does a court circular, marriages and deaths and a Bible quote too. It's very old-fashioned.
[30/11/2022, 02:47:51] Alice Lafferty: I find stuff like that comforting.
[30/11/2022, 02:47:57] Alex Regueiro: Right. In print media there's really nothing to complain about. Sweet and harmless like you say. On the 12/6 o'clock news however...
[30/11/2022, 02:48:03] Alice Lafferty: That is the news!
[30/11/2022, 02:48:09] Alex Regueiro: That quaintness sort of makes me happy though
[30/11/2022, 02:48:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeah but I rarely read newspapers or turn on the TV for news any more. Just the odd article... usually one I stumble across or a friend links me to!
[30/11/2022, 02:48:50] Alice Lafferty: I think that's the way everyone under 40 consumes news now.
[30/11/2022, 02:49:00] Alex Regueiro: I was trying to find a good Simpsons jibe at print media (from two decades ago) but couldn't...
[30/11/2022, 02:49:26] Alex Regueiro: About it being a dying medium basically. Though I reckon they've reformed pretty well and carved out a niche for themselves.
[30/11/2022, 02:49:33] Alice Lafferty: You're not like totally shut off, like, 'who's the prime minister?' sort of thing.
[30/11/2022, 02:49:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah of course, not to that level
[30/11/2022, 02:49:53] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, their niche is catering to young fogeys like myself.
[30/11/2022, 02:50:04] Alex Regueiro: But I used to stay very up to date. Like daily. No more. And I'm glad for it.
[30/11/2022, 02:50:07] Alice Lafferty: And the genuinely elderly of course.
[30/11/2022, 02:50:31] Alice Lafferty: Yeah people have been calling time on it for decades and yet...
[30/11/2022, 02:50:46] Alice Lafferty: I wonder what percentage of the Times' readerships online vs print.
[30/11/2022, 02:51:38] Alex Regueiro: But no one cares about them
[30/11/2022, 02:51:51] Alex Regueiro: (I wish I were joking...)
[30/11/2022, 02:52:13] Alex Regueiro: They seem to have focused on the subscription model, like the Telegraph... so probably a lot of people get both?
[30/11/2022, 02:52:24] Alice Lafferty: Eh, they're wealthy.
[30/11/2022, 02:52:49] Alex Regueiro: It's a bit annoying when I see a good Times article that's been paywalled... At least I can read the Telegraph ones.
[30/11/2022, 02:53:15] Alex Regueiro: Sort of. But also vulnerable. The pandemic showed us that!
[30/11/2022, 02:53:40] Alice Lafferty: Going to follow your lead I think.
[30/11/2022, 02:53:54] Alice Lafferty: Not their pensions though...
[30/11/2022, 02:54:38] Alex Regueiro: True. They grew up in times of economic prosperity (mainly) when the average job was enough to afford your own house and a relatively comfy lifestyle!
[30/11/2022, 02:55:00] Alice Lafferty: By the way, I thought you said you were sleeping at more regular hours!
[30/11/2022, 02:55:50] Alex Regueiro: My dad's deepest fear is being shunted off into an awful old folk's home. It's totally irrational given his savings haha.
[30/11/2022, 02:55:57] Alice Lafferty: Yep, free education, healthcare and pensions.
[30/11/2022, 02:56:10] Alex Regueiro: üëÄ
[30/11/2022, 02:56:20] Alice Lafferty: I'm not even talking about boomers I'm talking about the 75+ 'silent generation'.
[30/11/2022, 02:56:27] Alice Lafferty: Or whatever silly name they've come up with.
[30/11/2022, 02:56:44] Alex Regueiro: My cold sort of knocked my circadians for six again.
[30/11/2022, 02:56:49] Alex Regueiro: How about you?
[30/11/2022, 02:57:15] Alex Regueiro: Though I did just realise it's almost 3 and I've been putting off showering since getting back from the gym. Oops.
[30/11/2022, 02:57:34] Alice Lafferty: Might do a kind of holdover day where I try to stay awake until 7pm this evening.
[30/11/2022, 02:57:41] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[30/11/2022, 02:57:44] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. Still, bar the 70s and their early childhood, you could argue they have it better than us in many ways?
[30/11/2022, 02:57:59] Alex Regueiro: Interesting
[30/11/2022, 02:58:01] Alice Lafferty: Definitely.
[30/11/2022, 02:58:28] Alex Regueiro: Are your grandparents still alive?
[30/11/2022, 02:59:06] Alice Lafferty: Just my maternal grandmother, and she is quite far gone with dementia.
[30/11/2022, 02:59:12] Alice Lafferty: Are any of yours?
[30/11/2022, 02:59:58] Alex Regueiro: My drift forwards slower I think, and I can keep it getting too bad with tricks like exercise or melatonin sometimes... but still a bit tricky.
[30/11/2022, 03:00:20] Alex Regueiro: Nope, last one went in 2014. At least I got to know 3 pretty well though.
[30/11/2022, 03:01:00] Alice Lafferty: Ah good.
[30/11/2022, 03:01:40] Alex Regueiro: Dementia is so sad at a personal level. Back in 2011 I visited my granddad who was pretty far gone after his stroke, and my grandmother had late-stage dementia. Didn't even recognise me.
[30/11/2022, 03:02:07] Alice Lafferty: It is.
[30/11/2022, 03:02:44] Alice Lafferty: I'm ashamed to say I've avoided seeing my grandmother for the last few months because she's very confused and understandably anxious and belligerent sometimes.
[30/11/2022, 03:03:40] Alex Regueiro: I can't blame you to be hoenst
[30/11/2022, 03:03:48] Alex Regueiro: As bad as it seems on the surface
[30/11/2022, 03:04:03] Alice Lafferty: She's currently convinced that there are people living in her attic and kind of rants about it. She was very active and intelligent just ~a year ago. It's pretty difficult to watch.
[30/11/2022, 03:04:54] Alex Regueiro: Since mine lived so far away, was easier in a way. The only time I saw her like that, all her comments were silly and benign really
[30/11/2022, 03:05:16] Alex Regueiro: She confused my uncle (who was looking after her) and me for brothers.
[30/11/2022, 03:06:00] Alice Lafferty: She didn't seem to be suffering then? Or didn't have an awareness that she was losing her memory?
[30/11/2022, 03:06:03] Alex Regueiro: Started randomly speaking in Italian (from her youth)
[30/11/2022, 03:06:06] Alice Lafferty: I think that's preferable in some ways.
[30/11/2022, 03:06:19] Alice Lafferty: I think there is this regression to childhood in dementia patients.
[30/11/2022, 03:07:31] Alex Regueiro: She clearly was at some level, though she had such a positive and fun-loving character, she coped with it better than many I think. What really bothered her was seeing her husband, my granddad, in the home. Only rare moments of lucidity, but otherwise mentally and physically very incapacitated.
[30/11/2022, 03:07:40] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. Really saw it with her
[30/11/2022, 03:07:57] Alice Lafferty: My grandmother (before she got ill) actually said old age was like after you throw a stone in a pond, the ripples eventually converge back to the centre.
[30/11/2022, 03:08:15] Alex Regueiro: And she didn't even have full awareness of what had happened to him, but at some deep emotional level she knew, and you could tell it hurt her seeing him like that.
[30/11/2022, 03:08:33] Alex Regueiro: That's a really nice image.
[30/11/2022, 03:08:55] Alice Lafferty: That's awful. I think my paternal grandparents died (breast and stomach cancer respectively) before they became bedridden per se.
[30/11/2022, 03:08:58] Alex Regueiro: One of the better metaphors for sure
[30/11/2022, 03:09:29] Alex Regueiro: I missed this one somehow! Oh dear. That's sad. üôÅ
[30/11/2022, 03:09:46] Alex Regueiro: Not uncommon though, I gather
[30/11/2022, 03:09:59] Alex Regueiro: Did you know them well?
[30/11/2022, 03:10:45] Alex Regueiro: Going out bedridden isn't fun... though nor is cancer! So I won't say they were lucky. Just be glad you don't have to worry about the heritability there!
[30/11/2022, 03:11:00] Alice Lafferty: Yes. We were told the best strategy at that stage is simply to entertain their illusions/try to soothe them above all else.
[30/11/2022, 03:12:01] Alice Lafferty: Well, they were 'adoptive' grandparents. Honestly, there was always a certain distance... not imputed - I felt it before I knew my father was adopted.
[30/11/2022, 03:12:04] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, makes sense I suppose. Managed decline...
[30/11/2022, 03:12:11] Alice Lafferty: But it was sad all the same.
[30/11/2022, 03:12:30] Alex Regueiro: Oh I see. When did your dad tell you?
[30/11/2022, 03:12:48] Alice Lafferty: I want to sign a form that permits a doctor to give me a fatal dose of morphine if I'm ever unable to use the toilet independently.
[30/11/2022, 03:13:00] Alice Lafferty: When I was 13ish?
[30/11/2022, 03:13:50] Alex Regueiro: Bet he's glad at some level now... that they weren't his birth parents.
[30/11/2022, 03:14:01] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm totally with you
[30/11/2022, 03:14:24] Alex Regueiro: Reasonable, I suppose? At least they didn't tell you you were adopted heh
[30/11/2022, 03:15:12] Alex Regueiro: My parents have always told me (half jokingly half serious) to just pull the plug on them if they're ever vegetative or horribly disabled. They don't want to extend their lives for the mere sake of it.
[30/11/2022, 03:15:14] Alice Lafferty: Eh, I don't think they had particularly underiable genes. Their deaths weren't premature particularly. They were both 80+. Something has to get you in the end!
[30/11/2022, 03:15:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, cancer is a complex one... sometimes heritable, sometimes just a consequence of age and/or lifestyle.
[30/11/2022, 03:15:46] Alex Regueiro: Or a bit of both
[30/11/2022, 03:15:51] Alice Lafferty: Haha mine have said something similar.
[30/11/2022, 03:16:13] Alex Regueiro: My mother's mother had bowel cancer, which was awful, but she made it into her 80s too. She was very stoic for the most part.
[30/11/2022, 03:16:49] Alex Regueiro: Mother's father died when I was just 5, so barely even remember him.
[30/11/2022, 03:17:02] Alex Regueiro: Can't blame them, can we? Not that I like to think about it really.
[30/11/2022, 03:17:08] Alice Lafferty: Ouch. Did your genetic reports flag up anything of concern re cancer by the way ?
[30/11/2022, 03:17:40] Alice Lafferty: Interesting. My mother's father also died when I was 5.
[30/11/2022, 03:17:50] Alex Regueiro: Nope. I actually got a pretty positive report. Some sort of vulnerability to macular generation was probably the worst thing?
[30/11/2022, 03:18:00] Alex Regueiro: Was he the Jewish one?
[30/11/2022, 03:18:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[30/11/2022, 03:18:25] Alice Lafferty: In fairness, he did not look after himself very well.
[30/11/2022, 03:19:05] Alex Regueiro: FYI, in case you're thinking of doing the test or gifting one to to your mum or dad, 23andMe sent me an email about a big black Friday sale recently. Just thought I'd mention!
[30/11/2022, 03:19:10] Alice Lafferty: That must have been reassuring to find out!
[30/11/2022, 03:19:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh I see. Jews on the whole tend to be a fairly long-lived lot. The usual normal distribution though...
[30/11/2022, 03:19:45] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes you did mention that in the past.. I'm going to look.
[30/11/2022, 03:20:04] Alice Lafferty: Yes. I think his death was almost entirely due to poor lifestyle.
[30/11/2022, 03:20:07] Alex Regueiro: It was. I guess they just haven't identified the crazy gene yet!
[30/11/2022, 03:20:42] Alice Lafferty: Huh they have ¬£50 off a health and ancestry kit.
[30/11/2022, 03:20:50] Alex Regueiro: I see. My grandfather didn't have a particularly bad lifestyle. He died from a heart disease. Bad arteries. But he wasn't even overweight. Genetic predisposition plus maybe a less-than-ideal diet.
[30/11/2022, 03:20:52] Alice Lafferty: Only ¬£99. That's not bad at all.
[30/11/2022, 03:21:07] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, that's a good price, from what I know. üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 03:21:38] Alice Lafferty: He was kind of mentally ill though.
[30/11/2022, 03:21:40] Alex Regueiro: I think my mum avoided the gene (touch wood) but I know a few of her brothers and sisters have had to worry about cholesterol a lot, and none of them is overweight.
[30/11/2022, 03:21:48] Alice Lafferty: Sat fat?
[30/11/2022, 03:22:11] Alex Regueiro: Red meat, I think.
[30/11/2022, 03:22:30] Alice Lafferty: Right. I think it's quite controllable.
[30/11/2022, 03:22:43] Alice Lafferty: That'll do it I guess.
[30/11/2022, 03:22:47] Alex Regueiro: Maybe other stuff too. Didn't smoke. His own dad and granddad died young too. The infamous Horvath gene, we say!
[30/11/2022, 03:23:28] Alice Lafferty: Maybe ignorance is bliss...
[30/11/2022, 03:24:04] Alex Regueiro: Oh. Do you know what sort? Treatment for his generation was frankly primitive.
[30/11/2022, 03:24:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Though maybe I'd want to know at this point, if I have the gene!
[30/11/2022, 03:25:47] Alice Lafferty: Yes, we don't know. He was never formally diagnosed with anything. But obviously extremely eccentric. Used to cover his windows up with brown paper bags and pretty much didn't see anyone for the last 20 years of his life. Some kind of schizotypal personality disorder probably.
[30/11/2022, 03:26:24] Alice Lafferty: There's lots of that on my mother's sideüò¨
[30/11/2022, 03:27:16] Alice Lafferty: If that's not enough to put you off me as a romantic prospect...!
[30/11/2022, 03:29:32] Alex Regueiro: My other grandfather lived just shy of 90, which was pretty good considering everything he went through in life. The really tragic thing near the end was when I went to the care home and played the piano for him then. I finished playing and he said something about packing up the piano and moving it. He thought I was my father as a boy, and they were about to pack up and move across the country, as they did a few times back then. üò¢
[30/11/2022, 03:29:35] Alex Regueiro: (My grandmother with dementia was there too and even she knew what was going on at some level.)
[30/11/2022, 03:30:44] Alex Regueiro: Haha. Given my eccentricities and the loons in my family, I wouldn't have any legs to stand on!
[30/11/2022, 03:31:10] Alice Lafferty: That must have been moving... maybe not in an entirely negative way?
[30/11/2022, 03:31:30] Alex Regueiro: That's sad. It does sound a bit like the paranoia you get with schizophrenia-related conditions, yeah.
[30/11/2022, 03:32:02] Alex Regueiro: You're right, not entirely negative. But there was still a real sense of pathos.
[30/11/2022, 03:32:30] Alice Lafferty: I suppose it's nice to have some kind of identity with successive generations of a family..
[30/11/2022, 03:33:55] Alice Lafferty: Even when people lose their sense of self/temporality, they basically remained grounded in familial relationships.
[30/11/2022, 03:34:44] Alex Regueiro: Like I mentioned in passing the other day, there may be a little genetic exceptionalism with the Jews. They do tend to have especially high rates of genius and mental illness alike!
[30/11/2022, 03:34:54] Alex Regueiro: "The Lord giveth with one hand, and taketh away with the other."
[30/11/2022, 03:35:17] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes.
[30/11/2022, 03:35:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I think that's quite true
[30/11/2022, 03:35:43] Alice Lafferty: And sometimes "He takes and takes and takes..."
[30/11/2022, 03:36:07] Alex Regueiro: These things clear form strong neural connections that even strokes and dementia can't sever fully...
[30/11/2022, 03:36:15] Alex Regueiro: Hah indeed
[30/11/2022, 03:37:15] Alex Regueiro: And when he gives too much, you wonder if he's really the Devil tricking you.
[30/11/2022, 03:38:08] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to go take my shower finally, and then try to get some sleep.
[30/11/2022, 03:39:14] Alex Regueiro: Good to end on a cheery subject, after all!
[30/11/2022, 03:39:58] Alex Regueiro: Good night, my fellow vampire
[30/11/2022, 03:43:51] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm cooking some pasta.
[30/11/2022, 03:45:36] Alice Lafferty: :) good night.
[30/11/2022, 16:49:28] Alex Regueiro: Always a good late night option.
[30/11/2022, 16:49:59] Alex Regueiro: How are you faring with your plan for a circadian reset?
[30/11/2022, 18:33:20] Alice Lafferty: I ended up falling asleep at like 5am.
[30/11/2022, 18:33:24] Alice Lafferty: https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/eisai-presents-full-results-lecanemab-phase-3-confirmatory
[30/11/2022, 18:36:36] Alice Lafferty: Incidentally this was published today. "Lecanemab treatment showed 31% lower risk of converting to next stage of disease by Global CDR assessment (Hazard Ratio: 0.69)". Seems to be real. Interesting because I thought the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's had been debunked.
[30/11/2022, 18:38:21] Alex Regueiro: Oh that could be worse. Maybe I tired you out with all the texting. üôÇ
[30/11/2022, 18:40:09] Alex Regueiro: Are those the misfolded proteins?
[30/11/2022, 18:40:11] Alex Regueiro: Interesting
[30/11/2022, 18:40:36] Alex Regueiro: I'm hearing more about treatments for Alzheimers these days. Seems several promising drugs like that one are well in the works
[30/11/2022, 18:44:24] Alice Lafferty: I think those are prions.
[30/11/2022, 18:44:52] Alex Regueiro: Oh okay. My knowledge of biology is nicht gut
[30/11/2022, 18:45:26] Alice Lafferty: Although I think amyloid is also a form of protein...
[30/11/2022, 18:45:35] Alice Lafferty: Same!
[30/11/2022, 18:46:27] Alex Regueiro: I know the basics. Hopefully enough to look after my own body!
[30/11/2022, 18:46:31] Alice Lafferty: I do follow the research because I'm really hopeful there will be some good therapies available by the time I enter the high risk age group.
[30/11/2022, 18:46:46] Alice Lafferty: So like in 50-60 years. It looks promising.
[30/11/2022, 18:46:47] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's wise. I read the odd interesting article too.
[30/11/2022, 18:47:12] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I have heard the term "amyloid plaque" before actually
[30/11/2022, 18:47:31] Alex Regueiro: A mere 40-50 years for me. üòî
[30/11/2022, 18:49:37] Alice Lafferty: Optimistically 20 years (thinking of my parents). It doesn't even seem that extravagant.
[30/11/2022, 18:50:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Might well be good medicines in time for them even
[30/11/2022, 18:51:03] Alex Regueiro: They're pretty healthy for now I take it?
[30/11/2022, 18:52:00] Alex Regueiro: https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2022/event/beethovens-ninth
[30/11/2022, 18:52:26] Alex Regueiro: By the way, saw that the other day while looking for concerts to go to with a friend... too bad your away!  Thought you might enjoy that one.
[01/12/2022, 21:52:51] Alice Lafferty: Ah this looks good.
[01/12/2022, 21:53:15] Alice Lafferty: Hope you get to go anyway, and can tell me how it was.
[01/12/2022, 22:20:42] Alex Regueiro: Sure, will do
[01/12/2022, 22:20:48] Alex Regueiro: I'll probably go with a friend
[01/12/2022, 22:24:13] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough this came up on my Facebook feed just after I saw the concert!
[01/12/2022, 22:24:13] Alex Regueiro: https://www.facebook.com/watch?v=1325844608160974
[01/12/2022, 22:40:19] Alex Regueiro: Oh wow, tickets just became available for this one. https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/sir-andras-schiff-202212091930
[01/12/2022, 22:40:31] Alex Regueiro: One of my favourite (living) pianists. Any interest??
[01/12/2022, 22:45:09] Alex Regueiro: Very fortunate that the meetup group I occasionally attend sent a notice.
[02/12/2022, 11:00:26] Alice Lafferty: Damn, sorry I didn't see this earlier. It's already sold out.
[02/12/2022, 11:00:44] Alice Lafferty: Less than 24 hours? :s
[02/12/2022, 11:01:07] Alice Lafferty: Did you get a ticket?
[02/12/2022, 16:13:41] Alex Regueiro: Hah no worries
[02/12/2022, 16:15:11] Alex Regueiro: Oh it sold out ages ago. Was that way when I first checked a couple of weeks ago. But I got the notification from my meetup group and noticed it didn't say "sold out" any more...
[02/12/2022, 16:15:26] Alex Regueiro: Two people must have cancelled, so I snapped up those tickeets!
[02/12/2022, 16:15:36] Alex Regueiro: Does the "damn" suggest you're interested?
[02/12/2022, 18:20:05] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see..
[02/12/2022, 18:22:44] Alice Lafferty: I think it sounds nice. However if this pianist's a big deal for you, you might prefer to go with someone who would be properly appreciative of him!
[02/12/2022, 18:23:18] Alice Lafferty: If you have a spare ticket I'd be happy to go but also not offended if you offer it to someone else.
[02/12/2022, 19:00:54] Alex Regueiro: As long as the concert takes you fancy, I'd like for you to join me! I'm going to two others with different friends this month anyway. üôÇ
[02/12/2022, 19:01:24] Alex Regueiro: It's your chance to see an absolutely world-class performance, after seeing an amateur (albeit very high level) one heh
[02/12/2022, 19:16:30] Alex Regueiro: Here's another essay you might find interesting, by the way. https://www.spiked-online.com/2012/04/23/is-autism-just-another-identity/
[02/12/2022, 19:16:51] Alex Regueiro: Don't feel obliged to read it though
[02/12/2022, 19:17:02] Alex Regueiro: Just stumbled across it today
[02/12/2022, 19:35:09] Alice Lafferty: Ok!
[02/12/2022, 19:38:40] Alice Lafferty: I will read this in a sec but I think even if this seems like a kind of youth/internet phenomenon, it's downstream of a (well-meaning but wrong) medicine-led push to diagnose more women to redress the gender 'imbalance'. I was v suspicious about how my psychiatrist went out about my evaluation, I think I told you about this?
[02/12/2022, 19:39:39] Alice Lafferty: & 'destigmatisation' ininitiatives etc. This is imo anyway.
[02/12/2022, 19:50:18] Alice Lafferty: Also I'm only peripherally aware of online 'autism' communities.
[02/12/2022, 19:54:54] Alice Lafferty: All I know is that I have a lifelong pattern of failed social interactions and autism has become a useful shorthand for that. 

Although I'm working on a theory now that this could be due my physical unattractiveness. Physical attractiveness is the main female status indicator, and what I've experienced may just have been serotonin stress from long-tern social subordination.
[02/12/2022, 19:55:07] Alice Lafferty: 'Female autism' could just be 'ugly woman syndrome'.
[02/12/2022, 19:57:25] Alice Lafferty: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01378-2
[02/12/2022, 19:57:56] Alice Lafferty: Suspect this is how SSRIs work (if/when they do) - they replicate the neurochemical conditions of high status in the brain.
[02/12/2022, 19:58:42] Alice Lafferty: Now, I am ""info-dumping"" (or maybe not? maybe this is just normal) so I will stop.
[02/12/2022, 20:21:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeah you didn't go into too many details but you did say you were sceptical. Rightly so, I think.
[02/12/2022, 20:22:16] Alex Regueiro: I'd agree with you that you probably wouldn't have been placed on the spectrum if you were male.
[02/12/2022, 20:22:22] Alex Regueiro: Or 15 years ago for that matter
[02/12/2022, 20:23:26] Alice Lafferty: I did read the article and I thought it was very restrained actually.
[02/12/2022, 20:24:00] Alex Regueiro: I gather they're pretty big, though I know almost zilch about them. I also get the feeling that there's an impetus towards hyperdiagnosis (is that a word?) as a catch-all for anyone differs markedly from the norm
[02/12/2022, 20:24:24] Alex Regueiro: Interesting theory heh
[02/12/2022, 20:24:34] Alice Lafferty: I agree that the term has been very diluted in the last ~10 years. But the author didn't really touch on the online communities that have formed around it?
[02/12/2022, 20:24:52] Alice Lafferty: Not even - most of them are 'self-diagnosed'.
[02/12/2022, 20:24:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it was. What it contained was largely fair in my experience... could have been bolder, by Spiked standards at least,
[02/12/2022, 20:24:57] Alex Regueiro: Right
[02/12/2022, 20:25:00] Alex Regueiro: I was going to say that
[02/12/2022, 20:25:02] Alex Regueiro: but tentative
[02/12/2022, 20:25:17] Alex Regueiro: To comment on something I don't have (by genuine or self diagnosis!)
[02/12/2022, 20:26:18] Alice Lafferty: I had a reddit account for like ~2 months and got negative karma for merely stating in the 'Autism in women' communities that there is actually a diagnostic criteria.
[02/12/2022, 20:26:22] Alex Regueiro: I hate to say it, but you see a similar trend with gender dysphoria and even non-gender-dysphoria transgenderism. Self-diagnosis, complete prioritisation of the subjective, lowering standards...
[02/12/2022, 20:26:41] Alice Lafferty: I really urge you to go and look at them, they're pretty funny.
[02/12/2022, 20:26:57] Alex Regueiro: And no, you were totally fine. I don't actually mind your "info-dumping" but this wasn't even that.
[02/12/2022, 20:27:02] Alex Regueiro: Oh god
[02/12/2022, 20:27:09] Alex Regueiro: I've seen too much of Reddit already, for my sanity
[02/12/2022, 20:27:16] Alex Regueiro: As a lurker though mainly
[02/12/2022, 20:27:37] Alex Regueiro: Some subreddits are echo chambers of the most vile kind
[02/12/2022, 20:27:44] Alex Regueiro: Or at least deluded
[02/12/2022, 20:27:52] Alice Lafferty: For sure
[02/12/2022, 20:27:53] Alex Regueiro: So I'm sort of not surprised about this üôÅ
[02/12/2022, 20:28:40] Alex Regueiro: This seems impressively close to JP's talk about lobsters and whatnot. üòÄ
[02/12/2022, 20:29:58] Alice Lafferty: I mean, I agree with him on that. It's the Jungian stuff I couldn't get on board with.
[02/12/2022, 20:30:06] Alex Regueiro: Yeah so do I
[02/12/2022, 20:30:16] Alex Regueiro: Honestly, I never really took a proper dive into his Jungian stuff
[02/12/2022, 20:30:30] Alex Regueiro: Only picked up on what he mentioned it in talks that focused on other topics
[02/12/2022, 20:30:57] Alex Regueiro: The little I saw came across as big extrapolation, slightly pseudoscientific or borderline mystical.
[02/12/2022, 20:31:03] Alex Regueiro: So I never bothered learning more about it
[02/12/2022, 20:31:15] Alice Lafferty: I've never really seen an attractive woman in these spaces. Same with pro-ana.
[02/12/2022, 20:31:25] Alex Regueiro: Even though ironically Jung is credited with making psychology a much more scientific field following the bollocks of Freud!
[02/12/2022, 20:31:34] Alice Lafferty: It's literally just woo
[02/12/2022, 20:31:35] Alex Regueiro: Pro ana?
[02/12/2022, 20:33:30] Alice Lafferty: It is mystical. It's dressed-up platonism. Archetypes, enneagrams, etc patently nonsense.
[02/12/2022, 20:33:53] Alice Lafferty: Communities of anorexic women.
[02/12/2022, 20:34:21] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I really won't bother educating myself more on it then. I do get the impression Jung made some genuinely excellent contributions to psychology, though this probably isn't part of it.
[02/12/2022, 20:34:48] Alex Regueiro: A shame, because JP prides himself on being very empirical and he usually lives up to it in other areas... clearly not always
[02/12/2022, 20:34:52] Alex Regueiro: oh right
[02/12/2022, 20:35:37] Alice Lafferty: Honestly just beginning to think all philosophical systems can be reduced to platonic (rational) vs aristotelean (empirical)
[02/12/2022, 20:35:46] Alice Lafferty: Exactly, it's so weird.
[02/12/2022, 20:35:58] Alice Lafferty: Uh such as...?
[02/12/2022, 20:36:24] Alice Lafferty: 'Shadow work', 'anima and animus' - literally don't correspond to anything in reality.
[02/12/2022, 20:36:25] Alex Regueiro: I don't want to hypothesise too much, but I do think in many cases in the autism community the (perceived) low attractiveness of such women is partly a consequence of being quite far from the "neurotypical"... if you don't mind that term. And also from low self-esteem in part.
[02/12/2022, 20:37:25] Alex Regueiro: Is there meant to be a correlation between certain physical traits and autism? I vaguely recall reading something about this in men at least.
[02/12/2022, 20:37:51] Alice Lafferty: Although to be fair I think some neo-jungians HAVE made some good contributions to psychology yes.
[02/12/2022, 20:38:14] Alex Regueiro: Hah, it's not that simple to me, though I would probably agree it's the fundamental dichotomy/spectrum
[02/12/2022, 20:38:56] Alex Regueiro: Don't probe me too much because I'm pretty ignorant, but the collective unconscious, perhaps? And individuation? Extraversion?
[02/12/2022, 20:39:18] Alex Regueiro: I do think he at least gave more respect to the empirical aspect that Freud. And didn't have the same fixation on sex, thank goodness.
[02/12/2022, 20:39:56] Alice Lafferty: Physical attractiveness in women is not really affected by obscuring factors like personality or 'low self esteem' (as it is in men). Honest visual cues trigger hormonal responses to a very high degree of accuracy.
[02/12/2022, 20:40:19] Alex Regueiro: I know nothing about shadow work. Animus and anima sounds like a very primitive notion, but I can't believe it has much substance. Fun as pop psychology in novels, that's about it.
[02/12/2022, 20:40:51] Alice Lafferty: Yes there is... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404287/
[02/12/2022, 20:40:55] Alex Regueiro: Maybe not so much, but I do think women's perception of their own physical attractiveness is partly based on it.
[02/12/2022, 20:40:58] Alice Lafferty: This suggests androgyny interestingly.
[02/12/2022, 20:41:06] Alex Regueiro: I'm using anecdotal evidence from friends and acquaintances though, I'll admit!
[02/12/2022, 20:41:20] Alice Lafferty: 'several physical features (including faces) of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were more androgynous than those of their typically developed counterparts, suggesting that ASD may be understood as a 'gender defiant' disorder.'
[02/12/2022, 20:41:38] Alex Regueiro: And I'm not forgetting about the experiment you conducted, don't worry üôÇ
[02/12/2022, 20:42:05] Alex Regueiro: Interesting idea
[02/12/2022, 20:42:08] Alex Regueiro: yeah just saw that
[02/12/2022, 20:42:22] Alice Lafferty: No, if anything people overestimate their own attractiveness.
[02/12/2022, 20:42:42] Alex Regueiro: Might partially explain why so many (I think genuine) autists are drawn to the idea of transgenderism and its communities?
[02/12/2022, 20:42:52] Alex Regueiro: And all the non-binary stuff too
[02/12/2022, 20:44:04] Alice Lafferty: He had this relentless urge to categorise I think. I can see why it's appealing, but most people are not perfect cases.
[02/12/2022, 20:44:06] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure on the stats on this... I think most men do at least
[02/12/2022, 20:44:15] Alice Lafferty: Right.
[02/12/2022, 20:44:24] Alice Lafferty: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339852349_Unattractive_people_are_unaware_of_their_unattractiveness
[02/12/2022, 20:44:36] Alice Lafferty: Women might be slightly more accurate maybe..
[02/12/2022, 20:45:03] Alex Regueiro: Agrees with my experience.
[02/12/2022, 20:45:12] Alex Regueiro: I love how well-versed you are in this area of academic literature heh
[02/12/2022, 20:45:24] Alice Lafferty: I've gone about it in a much more objective way though.
[02/12/2022, 20:45:54] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I've read a lot of it. It's been really helpful.
[02/12/2022, 20:46:28] Alex Regueiro: I hope you don't mind this question... but I'm curious: do you see yourself as particularly (or even slightly) androgynous, either in mind or body?
[02/12/2022, 20:47:05] Alice Lafferty: Ehh, I might be somewhat psychologically androgynous yes.
[02/12/2022, 20:47:26] Alex Regueiro: (I'll let you know what I think after, but only if you want)
[02/12/2022, 20:47:39] Alice Lafferty: I guess I lack strongly sexually dimorphic physical characteristics too.
[02/12/2022, 20:48:11] Alice Lafferty: Like I'm pretty narrow all over.
[02/12/2022, 20:48:20] Alice Lafferty: Ok, what do you think?
[02/12/2022, 20:51:31] Alex Regueiro: I'd probably agree, a tad psychologically androgynous... though I'd phrase it more as you've not got the stereotypical female psychology, perhaps? And not exactly the stereotypical male one either.
[02/12/2022, 20:51:36] Alex Regueiro: Physically, I think you look quite feminine
[02/12/2022, 20:51:53] Alex Regueiro: Even if you're right about "body measurements" (the three numbers, whatever it's called)
[02/12/2022, 20:52:27] Alice Lafferty: No. I don't want to overstate the way in which I'm ""not like other girls"" or something.
[02/12/2022, 20:52:55] Alice Lafferty: I also find that men on average can be too boisterous or crass.
[02/12/2022, 20:53:52] Alice Lafferty: Plus I'm quite neurotic which influenced a lot of my decisions and is stereotypically female. But I rarely get on with women either. So yeah androgyny is probably right.
[02/12/2022, 20:54:36] Alice Lafferty: This is probably because yo have only ever seen me wearing makeup which give dishonest cues of physical femininity?
[02/12/2022, 20:54:49] Alex Regueiro: I would also add: it can work as a big plus. There's something about me that makes it particularly difficult for me to deal with the very stereotypical (I stress, stereotypical, and some would say misogynistic) female personality traits like emotionalism and diminished interest in things and abstract ideas.
[02/12/2022, 20:54:53] Alice Lafferty: I feel like you've described yourself as androgynous as well before.
[02/12/2022, 20:55:20] Alex Regueiro: I didn't use that word, but I think the first time we met I described myself as "very masculine in some ways, a bit feminine in others"
[02/12/2022, 20:55:21] Alice Lafferty: Haha, you and all men!
[02/12/2022, 20:56:21] Alex Regueiro: Right. I honestly think men have a preference for strongly female physical traits and slightly masculine mental traits. I'm like that to a fair extent.
[02/12/2022, 20:56:37] Alex Regueiro: And frankly I think you do pretty well on that basis
[02/12/2022, 20:56:38] Alice Lafferty: Right. You are very systems-orientated (masculine) but perhaps score lower in something like aggression?
[02/12/2022, 20:57:42] Alice Lafferty: Masculine traits are weird because they seem to come together to create two very distinct and incoherent 'types'.
[02/12/2022, 20:58:02] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, aggression is a tough one to pinpoint. I'm definitely more aggressive than your average "nerd". I've gotten into a few fights in my time too. But nor am I too high on the scale. I never go out looking for a rowdy time.
[02/12/2022, 20:58:19] Alex Regueiro: But I can often say what I think to people's faces or even swear at them without worrying about escalating! üò¨
[02/12/2022, 20:58:24] Alex Regueiro: i.e. I'm not particularly conflict averse
[02/12/2022, 20:58:51] Alex Regueiro: Even though I really don't enjoy the "rough and tumble" side of being a boy/man
[02/12/2022, 20:59:06] Alex Regueiro: And yes, I'm certainly system-oriented and drawn to things and abstract ideas.
[02/12/2022, 20:59:12] Alice Lafferty: Like: autistic, cerebral, hyper-rational, vs 'loutish', unsophisticated, hyper-violent etc. Do you recognise what I mean?
[02/12/2022, 20:59:35] Alex Regueiro: I'd probably go down as a mix of masculine and not-so-masculine in terms of appearance too.
[02/12/2022, 20:59:48] Alice Lafferty: I think men select only for physical femininity and disregard psychological traits.
[02/12/2022, 20:59:48] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I know exactly what you mean
[02/12/2022, 21:00:03] Alice Lafferty: Really, I actually struggle to picture this!
[02/12/2022, 21:00:06] Alex Regueiro: Either you're somewhat mistaken or I'm a very atypical man in that regard ha
[02/12/2022, 21:00:15] Alice Lafferty: I guess you have a physical advantage over most people?
[02/12/2022, 21:01:44] Alice Lafferty: I think you fall around average in terms of sexual dimorphism? I'm actually not that good at telling with men.
[02/12/2022, 21:02:00] Alex Regueiro: I also find (especially with women who are high in aggression) that people tend to get very defensive, unnecessarily so, with tall men
[02/12/2022, 21:02:01] Alice Lafferty: Besides physically hyper masculine men are not that attractive, as we've discussed.
[02/12/2022, 21:02:14] Alex Regueiro: Sounds fair
[02/12/2022, 21:02:27] Alex Regueiro: I did cite a study into this, though obviously it's in my favour. üòÄ
[02/12/2022, 21:02:52] Alice Lafferty: Maybe we're going about it the wrong way in trying to bean-count every gendered trait anyway.
[02/12/2022, 21:03:01] Alex Regueiro: And a subset of women do really like hyper-masculine men. You know, very muscly, tough guy attitude, Cro-Magnon looks!
[02/12/2022, 21:03:08] Alex Regueiro: Not sure how large that subset is...
[02/12/2022, 21:03:51] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, I guess on alert for potential danger or something...?
[02/12/2022, 21:03:58] Alex Regueiro: Possibly because it's offset by my other stereotypical male traits? I'm quite a paradox in that respect, as are all men to a degree.
[02/12/2022, 21:04:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Well, there's a market for almost anything.
[02/12/2022, 21:04:09] Alex Regueiro: Something like that
[02/12/2022, 21:04:24] Alex Regueiro: Men don't usually have a problem with me. Or most women for that matter.
[02/12/2022, 21:04:44] Alex Regueiro: And the Internet is proof of it. You know the saying...
[02/12/2022, 21:05:30] Alice Lafferty: Specifically - it doesn't make sense that men would go about life in a 'cool' highly analytic way then just randomly explode in hot violent outbursts... they seem to be contradiction.
[02/12/2022, 21:05:44] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I've mischaracterised the first trait slightly.
[02/12/2022, 21:05:53] Alex Regueiro: I'm very much of the defensive type of conflict-averse. Partly this may be learned, from my school days... but partly I think it's inherent
[02/12/2022, 21:06:12] Alice Lafferty: Was your school all-boys?
[02/12/2022, 21:06:20] Alex Regueiro: Primary school yes, secondary school mixed
[02/12/2022, 21:06:43] Alice Lafferty: Must have slightly diffused the tension?
[02/12/2022, 21:07:12] Alex Regueiro: Bullying was an issue between the ages of roughly 9/10 and 15/16. For a number of reasons. I was young for the year and socially late to develop anyway. And always pretty bookish and solitary. But I learnt in due course!
[02/12/2022, 21:07:27] Alex Regueiro: Wasn't particularly tall until about 13/14 either.
[02/12/2022, 21:07:28] Alice Lafferty: This is probably the best way to be anyway. Not antagonistic but also not a push-over.
[02/12/2022, 21:07:48] Alice Lafferty: Really, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope not physical?
[02/12/2022, 21:08:00] Alex Regueiro: I hope you're right. I'd like to think it's the way. I've certainly never been called a pushover, not remotely.
[02/12/2022, 21:08:15] Alex Regueiro: Very rarely.
[02/12/2022, 21:08:34] Alex Regueiro: It sucked, but I look it as part of the maturation process now. Taught me a lot of useful things.
[02/12/2022, 21:08:46] Alice Lafferty: Were you quite earnest?
[02/12/2022, 21:08:51] Alex Regueiro: very much so
[02/12/2022, 21:08:55] Alex Regueiro: since a young age even
[02/12/2022, 21:09:11] Alice Lafferty: From primary school, those were the boys who seemed to catch the most flak. It was quite sad, they were in general just trying to keep to themselves.
[02/12/2022, 21:09:21] Alex Regueiro: Serious-minded. I only really started balancing that out around 15/16.
[02/12/2022, 21:09:28] Alex Regueiro: Sixth form was much more pleasant for me
[02/12/2022, 21:09:47] Alice Lafferty: It's good that you've come to look at it that way I guess?
[02/12/2022, 21:09:48] Alex Regueiro: Did you have to put up with much bullying or did you avoid it mainly?
[02/12/2022, 21:10:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I'd say at least half of all boys have to put up with some sort of bullying during their formative years.
[02/12/2022, 21:10:10] Alice Lafferty: Although, I used to have an adaptation of the old saying: 'what doesn't kill you makes you weird at parties'.
[02/12/2022, 21:10:28] Alex Regueiro: I had more than most, but I don't look at it like a total negative now. It really wasn't
[02/12/2022, 21:10:55] Alice Lafferty: That is good!
[02/12/2022, 21:10:57] Alex Regueiro: Boys definitely gain respect in their peer groups by showing toughness, either verbally or physically. Took me a while to realise that.
[02/12/2022, 21:11:16] Alice Lafferty: It's that time between 11-15 when people are going through puberty...
[02/12/2022, 21:11:29] Alex Regueiro: Since I never really cared about being part of any clique.
[02/12/2022, 21:12:06] Alice Lafferty: No. Besides girls don't really bully in the same explicit way, I think. People largely left me to my own devices.
[02/12/2022, 21:12:53] Alice Lafferty: At a certain age does academic intelligence start to garner respect over physical/athletic?
[02/12/2022, 21:13:01] Alex Regueiro: I was just going to say, girls are very different in how they bully. The psychology of social dynamics and hierarchy is something else entirely.
[02/12/2022, 21:13:08] Alice Lafferty: Not sure because was in single-sex school.
[02/12/2022, 21:13:15] Alex Regueiro: To a certain degree yes. But only up to a point
[02/12/2022, 21:13:28] Alex Regueiro: Most of it was me learning how to diffuse situations better and stick up for myself when need be
[02/12/2022, 21:13:44] Alex Regueiro: Which came surprisingly naturally once reached a certain age.
[02/12/2022, 21:13:58] Alice Lafferty: This to me represents the maturation of one type of masculinity to another. Although of course lots of men never make it.
[02/12/2022, 21:14:29] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, I'm glad. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone, even though it's all to common for boys, and I personally grew from it.
[02/12/2022, 21:14:55] Alex Regueiro: I would say most men (or at least a huge minority) get stuck in a state of perpetual adolescence.
[02/12/2022, 21:14:58] Alex Regueiro: To some degree
[02/12/2022, 21:15:05] Alice Lafferty: Yea. It's even quite possible I was getting bullied but couldn't tell.
[02/12/2022, 21:15:24] Alice Lafferty: It's more like exclusion/reputation damage
[02/12/2022, 21:15:51] Alex Regueiro: Makes sense
[02/12/2022, 21:16:00] Alice Lafferty: There's actually a very Peterson-like flavour to this whole story arc.
[02/12/2022, 21:16:02] Alex Regueiro: It's kind of obvious why the dynamics are so different too. In terms of evo psych. üòâ
[02/12/2022, 21:16:07] Alex Regueiro: Haha there is
[02/12/2022, 21:16:17] Alice Lafferty: Ugh why is he infecting my thoughts so much...
[02/12/2022, 21:16:32] Alice Lafferty: Maybe there is something to him if I keep referencing him.
[02/12/2022, 21:16:52] Alex Regueiro: I do think he has a lot of good advice, especially to boys and young men. We both have a distaste for the Jungian crap and his more recent lack of nuance too, of course.
[02/12/2022, 21:17:01] Alice Lafferty: Honestly he's a good synecdoche for conservative ideals of personhood generally.
[02/12/2022, 21:17:11] Alice Lafferty: He's a great populariser, I have to hand it to him.
[02/12/2022, 21:17:36] Alex Regueiro: Yes, though I think he also has a lot of cognitive dissonance between that and his libertarian inclinations!
[02/12/2022, 21:17:45] Alex Regueiro: Yep.
[02/12/2022, 21:18:11] Alice Lafferty: In (women's) defence I will say that they are genuinely capable of behaving more cooperatively than men.
[02/12/2022, 21:18:12] Alex Regueiro: And talk about "male mind", he has that on steroids. Not the hormonal side, in terms of aggression. Just in his personality and thinking style.
[02/12/2022, 21:18:34] Alex Regueiro: Yes probably.
[02/12/2022, 21:18:35] Alice Lafferty: And I believe there actually is such a thing as 'female solidarity', that has its roots in female motherhood coaltions.
[02/12/2022, 21:18:49] Alice Lafferty: I've really seen it, I don't think it was fake.
[02/12/2022, 21:19:03] Alex Regueiro: They're also more capable of backstabbing and undermining peers, I'd say. One of those stereotypes with a lot of truth in it.
[02/12/2022, 21:19:13] Alex Regueiro: Don't dispute it at all, yep
[02/12/2022, 21:19:53] Alice Lafferty: Yes although isn't an interest in psychology itself female-coded.
[02/12/2022, 21:20:10] Alice Lafferty: I mean, psychology degrees are 85%+ female I think.
[02/12/2022, 21:20:36] Alex Regueiro: It seems like that. Though perhaps an academic/intellectual and "folk" or "everyday" approach to psychology can be distinguished? Not sure.
[02/12/2022, 21:21:00] Alex Regueiro: Just talking about predilection here, not necessarily ability.
[02/12/2022, 21:21:16] Alice Lafferty: I've noticed that men with higher verbal intelligence tend to engage in these more  feminine reputation-destruction tactics.
[02/12/2022, 21:21:32] Alex Regueiro: Yes
[02/12/2022, 21:21:41] Alex Regueiro: Could be EQ generally, which women seem to be higher in on average
[02/12/2022, 21:21:54] Alex Regueiro: (if you buy it as a self-consistent measure, even)
[02/12/2022, 21:22:06] Alice Lafferty: I though the general distinction was an interest in people vs things. Maybe he to some extent treats 'people as things to be studied'.
[02/12/2022, 21:22:12] Alice Lafferty: And therein lies the difference.
[02/12/2022, 21:23:03] Alex Regueiro: This was basically what I was getting at yeah
[02/12/2022, 21:23:35] Alex Regueiro: I think you do actually agree with JP on a surprising amount, just you find something about his demeanour and style antipathetic... which is not uncommon, especially for women!
[02/12/2022, 21:23:40] Alice Lafferty: Kind of interesting. Idk which one is better in a clinical setting.
[02/12/2022, 21:23:52] Alex Regueiro: Plus you've sniffed out the BS in what he says.
[02/12/2022, 21:24:44] Alice Lafferty: I had a knee-jerk allergic reaction to him when I was in my early teens because he was basically like 'women are side-characters who do not really participate in meaningful intellectual activity'.
[02/12/2022, 21:25:04] Alice Lafferty: Which he more or less says on many occasions!
[02/12/2022, 21:26:01] Alex Regueiro: He never says it in those words, and I'm still not sure he quite means that, but I can at least see why you got that impression
[02/12/2022, 21:26:12] Alice Lafferty: I was afraid that accepting average sex differences would damn me to some kind of half life. Didn't yet appreciate the term 'average'.
[02/12/2022, 21:26:14] Alex Regueiro: His target audience is quite explicitly male on most occasions
[02/12/2022, 21:26:17] Alex Regueiro: especially in his earlier stuff
[02/12/2022, 21:26:28] Alex Regueiro: ha, yes...
[02/12/2022, 21:26:39] Alice Lafferty: I promise you that he does say exactly that. If I can find the video I will show you.
[02/12/2022, 21:26:55] Alex Regueiro: Okay, please do if it's easy. Don't worry otherwise
[02/12/2022, 21:27:00] Alex Regueiro: I've only watched a (large) smattering
[02/12/2022, 21:27:13] Alice Lafferty: He basically says men need to strive for x y and z desiderata but 'women don't have to worry about that' because they can just 'have children'
[02/12/2022, 21:27:33] Alice Lafferty: It's a shame.
[02/12/2022, 21:27:36] Alex Regueiro: Ah right. Now that sounds closer to something he'd say
[02/12/2022, 21:28:25] Alex Regueiro: He's right to point out the evo psych basis of things, but he's probably at fault for portraying it as something we most follow slavishly... in modern society that's not always helpful.
[02/12/2022, 21:29:07] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I'm struggling to remember which video this was. It was an offhand remark in one of his lectures. Sorry!
[02/12/2022, 21:29:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah no problem.
[02/12/2022, 21:29:42] Alex Regueiro: Once you rephrased it, sounds more believable. We all put our own subconscious slant on things, which may or may not be fair.
[02/12/2022, 21:30:27] Alex Regueiro: Even though he's very precise with his language, he's sometimes unaware of how people tend to interpret his comments, I think. This was especially true early on
[02/12/2022, 21:30:33] Alice Lafferty: His project seemed to be to try to capture ""gender"" on every level of analysis, biological, social and metaphysical (this is what the Jung stuff does for him).
[02/12/2022, 21:30:48] Alex Regueiro: early on in his period of fame
[02/12/2022, 21:31:04] Alex Regueiro: I see...
[02/12/2022, 21:31:29] Alex Regueiro: I trust on you, since you've surely read more about the Jungian claptrap even whilst hating
[02/12/2022, 21:31:31] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I think he was very aware of how they came across. That's why he often answers questions with zero affect, kind of drawls.
[02/12/2022, 21:31:32] Alex Regueiro: hating it
[02/12/2022, 21:31:52] Alex Regueiro: So you're saying he's a troll basically? üòõ
[02/12/2022, 21:31:59] Alex Regueiro: You may be right, especially these days
[02/12/2022, 21:33:03] Alice Lafferty: I mean he orientated his 'how to live a meaningful life' towards one particular group even though I think it has universal application.
[02/12/2022, 21:33:27] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I think he's become very media adept.
[02/12/2022, 21:33:55] Alex Regueiro: I'd agree with you now (doing it all deliberately, to effect), though I think it was just his personality for the most part
[02/12/2022, 21:34:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah fair point. Maybe not all of the things he aims at young guys translates over well to girls/women, but a lot of it surely does
[02/12/2022, 21:34:47] Alex Regueiro: It's only natural he feels more comfortable giving it to guys (and that guys will be more receptive to him!)
[02/12/2022, 21:35:02] Alice Lafferty: We don't have to devote so much time to talking about him though! He's gained such prominnce only against the backdrop of impoverished public intellctuals.
[02/12/2022, 21:35:37] Alice Lafferty: *I mean, he looks very sophisticated standing next to like Alain de Botton.
[02/12/2022, 21:35:40] Alex Regueiro: I believe the statistics suggest that lack of meaning has come to afflict modern Western all-round, just men got hit the worst?
[02/12/2022, 21:35:46] Alex Regueiro: Alain de Botton hah
[02/12/2022, 21:35:49] Alex Regueiro: Okay, we move onto him
[02/12/2022, 21:35:57] Alex Regueiro: Do you care for him / his stuff?
[02/12/2022, 21:36:49] Alice Lafferty: Ok, maybe unfair to use him, as I've only cursorily watched some of his youtube videos... Idk he represents early 2010s middlebrow to me.
[02/12/2022, 21:36:55] Alex Regueiro: I'm mainly familiar with School of Life plus a few of his TV appearances and articles
[02/12/2022, 21:37:01] Alice Lafferty: Maybe that's unfair though.
[02/12/2022, 21:37:07] Alex Regueiro: Haha I don't think that's too unfair
[02/12/2022, 21:37:13] Alex Regueiro: He also has strong naive-liberal vibes
[02/12/2022, 21:37:44] Alex Regueiro: As in, "everything will be spiffing if we're just more rationalist and open-minded"
[02/12/2022, 21:38:26] Alice Lafferty: I'm skeptical of this because a) it's not a quantifiable and b) we have no real access to how 'meaningful' people's lives were beyond a couple of generations ago.
[02/12/2022, 21:38:41] Alex Regueiro: It's self-reported as far as I know
[02/12/2022, 21:38:47] Alice Lafferty: Right, reminds me of like AC Grayling.
[02/12/2022, 21:38:49] Alex Regueiro: But anecdotally it's very easy to believe
[02/12/2022, 21:39:07] Alex Regueiro: That we've been suffering from an increasing existential crisis since the early 20th C, probably earlier.
[02/12/2022, 21:39:20] Alice Lafferty: Couldn't that be due to different social norms in discussing mental health and such?
[02/12/2022, 21:39:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Did I link you to his debate with Tom Holland? That's a gem.
[02/12/2022, 21:39:40] Alice Lafferty: I don't think this is clear?
[02/12/2022, 21:39:51] Alex Regueiro: In part, but I generally think Nietzsche was spot on with this analysis
[02/12/2022, 21:40:13] Alice Lafferty: I wish that argument had had a better defender because it is the correct one. But yeah he's not great.
[02/12/2022, 21:40:49] Alice Lafferty: Idk.. read the psalms.
[02/12/2022, 21:40:52] Alex Regueiro: We mainly operate within completely impoverished value systems these days. Since the burden to create and maintain those systems falls almost squarely on the individual these days
[02/12/2022, 21:41:09] Alex Regueiro: Which argument exactly?
[02/12/2022, 21:41:52] Alice Lafferty: This is like an existentialist solution... you have to become yourself a meaning-maker.
[02/12/2022, 21:42:10] Alex Regueiro: Right, that's what the existentialist take is, basically
[02/12/2022, 21:42:21] Alex Regueiro: But the reality is that most of us have proven totally incapable of doing so
[02/12/2022, 21:42:31] Alex Regueiro: It's arguably too big a burden even for a towering philosophical mind!
[02/12/2022, 21:42:57] Alice Lafferty: Yes it's the failure to live up to the promise.
[02/12/2022, 21:43:29] Alex Regueiro: To have almost no social "guide-rails" or "training wheels" in terms of philosophy of life, meaning, etc. In a liberal society ideally we could challenge them and reject parts as we mature and think about it. But not having them in the first place is super problematic
[02/12/2022, 21:43:53] Alex Regueiro: And I'm not saying (traditional) Christianity are necessarily the right guiderails. But they were a lot better than the nothign we have now.
[02/12/2022, 21:44:16] Alice Lafferty: I am attracted to the idea that you have to strip everything away and confront nihilism - then you come away and say 'ok. what now?'
[02/12/2022, 21:44:24] Alice Lafferty: It's thrilling and fertile in a way.
[02/12/2022, 21:45:09] Alice Lafferty: It's bad on a societal level for sure.
[02/12/2022, 21:45:29] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of promethean.
[02/12/2022, 21:45:29] Alex Regueiro: What do you think people are doing now in developing the pseudoreligion of wokeism? It's a natural response to the ever-increasing existential crisis of modernity we've been living through. We had postmodernism from the 50s/60s, and now we've sort of come full circle. To reject that and embrace absolute morality and certainty again... just a rather nefarious sort
[02/12/2022, 21:45:39] Alex Regueiro: Right. I'm not saying everyone suffers the same...
[02/12/2022, 21:45:45] Alex Regueiro: But it's epidemic, and has been for decades, either way
[02/12/2022, 21:46:06] Alice Lafferty: Yes, social progressiveness is itself a framework of meaning.
[02/12/2022, 21:46:12] Alice Lafferty: So reject that too.
[02/12/2022, 21:46:48] Alex Regueiro: From a philosophical perspective, yes it is. And Nietzsche thought we should embrace the challenge of nihilism. (Obviously he was celebrating the decline of Christianity at one level, whilst pointing out its challenges.) But it's also utterly terrifying, and it should be.
[02/12/2022, 21:47:16] Alice Lafferty: And be the genuinely unaligned true subject.
[02/12/2022, 21:47:27] Alice Lafferty: It is terrifying.
[02/12/2022, 21:48:44] Alice Lafferty: That's why I still maintain 'post-modern neomarxism' never made sense!
[02/12/2022, 21:48:54] Alex Regueiro: But this is fundamentally why I'm a conservative ‚Äì unless you have a proper replacement for some cultural status quo in mind, and have good evidence it will work at least as well as the thing you're replacing, you are a fool to tear down the old! It's the fallacy of the whigs in particular, and of the progressives more generally.
[02/12/2022, 21:49:05] Alex Regueiro: And of course, I say this even though I'm agnostic and liberal in certain qualified senses (even progressive in a few ways, perhaps.
[02/12/2022, 21:49:19] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[02/12/2022, 21:49:25] Alex Regueiro: I always had qualms with it
[02/12/2022, 21:49:35] Alice Lafferty: Or your society undergoes increasing differentiation until everyone occupies a basically bespoke social role?
[02/12/2022, 21:49:36] Alex Regueiro: It's true it had roots in both these things, especially neo-Marxism
[02/12/2022, 21:49:40] Alex Regueiro: but it's morphed into something quite unique now
[02/12/2022, 21:50:00] Alex Regueiro: Far more certain, and it's departed even from the teachings of the old Critical Theorists.
[02/12/2022, 21:50:37] Alice Lafferty: Personally, I'm kind of inclined to advocate for social conservatism on a social organisational level but radical individualism for myself üòä
[02/12/2022, 21:50:42] Alex Regueiro: I used to have that desire, but not so much any more. To an extent, it's a noble aim. But it's also terribly unpragmatic and beyond the capability of a mere human.
[02/12/2022, 21:50:58] Alex Regueiro: Haha. I think I sort of do that already.
[02/12/2022, 21:50:59] Alice Lafferty: No, post-modernism and Marxism are fundamentally opposed.
[02/12/2022, 21:51:11] Alex Regueiro: The fusion of the two is an interesting question
[02/12/2022, 21:51:16] Alex Regueiro: Not necessarily diametrically opposed
[02/12/2022, 21:51:29] Alex Regueiro: Burke should be the guide! The liberal conservative.
[02/12/2022, 21:51:36] Alice Lafferty: There was no fusion. Progressivism just filled the void clawed open by post-modernism.
[02/12/2022, 21:51:51] Alice Lafferty: They were successive ideologies, not merged.
[02/12/2022, 21:51:59] Alex Regueiro: May as they well be, they did come together in academic circles like Critical Theory and the French school.
[02/12/2022, 21:52:12] Alex Regueiro: I meant conservatism and indivudalism here
[02/12/2022, 21:52:16] Alex Regueiro: individualism* damn
[02/12/2022, 21:52:32] Alex Regueiro: Sartre was the first
[02/12/2022, 21:53:21] Alice Lafferty: Post-modernism is just relativism. Any system can rush to fill the void left by relativism. It just so happened in the 20 C to be lib progressivism.
[02/12/2022, 21:54:43] Alice Lafferty: This is probably going to turn you off immediately but this desire is kind of rooted in my desire to escape the sex binary. Yet to find a system under which I am not ontologically inferior, so I prefer to eschew them all.
[02/12/2022, 21:54:55] Alex Regueiro: Right, it's extreme relativism. But people like Sartre and the Critical Theorists sort of embraced it as a tool for tearing down traditional Western culture and social structures.
[02/12/2022, 21:55:06] Alice Lafferty: I won't keep talking about this as I understand it is of limited interested.
[02/12/2022, 21:55:06] Alex Regueiro: Even if they didn't want the nihilism it entails
[02/12/2022, 21:55:20] Alex Regueiro: They presumably knew their own revolutionary ideology could then fill the voisd
[02/12/2022, 21:56:06] Alex Regueiro: Well, I'm curious at least. Why do you want to escape it? In what way to you consider yourself ontologically inferior?
[02/12/2022, 21:56:10] Alice Lafferty: I see. Yeah this has survived because some pop conservatives are not the greatest thinkers.
[02/12/2022, 21:56:35] Alex Regueiro: The paradox has survived you mean? If so, then yes
[02/12/2022, 21:57:12] Alex Regueiro: Sounds like something that a non-binary or transhuman activist would say. üò¨
[02/12/2022, 21:57:21] Alice Lafferty: No, this is what I'm saying. The existentialists/post-modernists deconstructed Western systems of meaning.
[02/12/2022, 21:57:50] Alice Lafferty: Postmodernism itself does not contain an explicitly or implicitly progressive agenda.  That was added later.
[02/12/2022, 21:58:10] Alex Regueiro: Okay, fair. I'm just saying the postmodernists and neo-Marxists were sometimes the same people, because they realised how complementary these ideologies could be to their ultimate goals and "praxis". Even if in theory they were contradictory.
[02/12/2022, 21:58:30] Alice Lafferty: Progressivism is basically supercessionist.
[02/12/2022, 21:58:58] Alex Regueiro: Hah that's a new one to me. *Looks up supercessionist*
[02/12/2022, 21:59:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes, this is true. But the postmodernism precedes the progressivism. Probably because as you said, these guys couldn't cope with the void they had uncovered.
[02/12/2022, 21:59:29] Alice Lafferty: I spelt it wrong!
[02/12/2022, 21:59:50] Alice Lafferty: It's a theological term I've inserted inappropriately here to mean 'successive'. :s
[02/12/2022, 21:59:56] Alex Regueiro: Either that or they were fundamentally neo-Marxists and postmodernism was just a means to an end.
[02/12/2022, 22:00:01] Alex Regueiro: Don't know their work well enough to say which
[02/12/2022, 22:00:06] Alex Regueiro: may be different case by case
[02/12/2022, 22:00:25] Alex Regueiro: Sound like they should be burnt at the stake anyway!
[02/12/2022, 22:00:26] Alice Lafferty: Yes that must be true of some of them too.
[02/12/2022, 22:00:40] Alice Lafferty: Sorry maybe I didn't explain myself very clearly.
[02/12/2022, 22:01:07] Alex Regueiro: I'm literally the anti-Whig. In the philosophical sense. Although ironically I find myself admiring certain historical Whigs.
[02/12/2022, 22:01:21] Alice Lafferty: I'd prefer to be 'a person' rather than 'a woman'.
[02/12/2022, 22:01:58] Alice Lafferty: I kind of discard Whiggism as a philosophy because as you know I'm a historical materialist.
[02/12/2022, 22:02:18] Alex Regueiro: Right, so this is sort of the other end of the horseshoe from things like non-binary sex and transhumanism!
[02/12/2022, 22:02:32] Alex Regueiro: Are you not, you think?
[02/12/2022, 22:02:35] Alice Lafferty: Like - the Whiggs aren't/weren't necessary. They just provided idealogical lubrication for inevitable technological changes.
[02/12/2022, 22:02:45] Alex Regueiro: You don't feel like you're treated first as a person in life?
[02/12/2022, 22:03:02] Alice Lafferty: No, never.
[02/12/2022, 22:03:11] Alex Regueiro: Weren't they necessary in that very sense though?
[02/12/2022, 22:03:22] Alice Lafferty: 'Man' is a stand-in for the universal, 'woman' isn't.
[02/12/2022, 22:03:40] Alex Regueiro: As the Hegelian antithesis, at least!
[02/12/2022, 22:03:42] Alice Lafferty: You might think this is all academic fluff but some of them were correct.
[02/12/2022, 22:04:09] Alice Lafferty: *some of the 20th C feminist thinkers.
[02/12/2022, 22:04:29] Alex Regueiro: I view Whiggism as inherently historicist. "The inevitable progression to better and better."
[02/12/2022, 22:04:44] Alice Lafferty: Well yes, just not in the way they thought. They conceived as themselves as the engines of change although their real role was after the fact. But yes you're right.
[02/12/2022, 22:05:17] Alex Regueiro: Eh, just look at the etymology. I mean, I accept the notion of the patriarchy to some extent, though I don't think it's a particularly useful concept all the same. It's a specious way of framing phenomena that are much better explained other ways.
[02/12/2022, 22:05:39] Alex Regueiro: Etymology being that it just meant "human" originally.
[02/12/2022, 22:05:45] Alex Regueiro: Until some point in Middle English
[02/12/2022, 22:06:02] Alice Lafferty: I'm not talking about legal systems like the patriarchy. I mean at the level of the ontological.
[02/12/2022, 22:06:13] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly.
[02/12/2022, 22:06:33] Alex Regueiro: We construct our ontology, as a social consensus, a sort of intersubjective truth.
[02/12/2022, 22:06:33] Alice Lafferty: So why did it come to mean 'male', and  exclude 'female'?
[02/12/2022, 22:06:46] Alice Lafferty: I disagree with this.
[02/12/2022, 22:06:56] Alex Regueiro: Because men occupied almost the entirety of the public sphere.
[02/12/2022, 22:07:14] Alex Regueiro: That's the sense of the patriarchy that is valid
[02/12/2022, 22:07:17] Alex Regueiro: perhaps the only one
[02/12/2022, 22:07:25] Alice Lafferty: I mean, if that's the case than I'm truly screwed.
[02/12/2022, 22:07:31] Alex Regueiro: Why??
[02/12/2022, 22:08:05] Alice Lafferty: This doesn't explain why 'man' (meaning 'humankind') would come to exclude women.
[02/12/2022, 22:08:55] Alice Lafferty: This is less an important point and more of an analogy about the general status of women.
[02/12/2022, 22:09:18] Alice Lafferty: If the social and ontological are identical, then women are ontologically inferior.
[02/12/2022, 22:09:56] Alex Regueiro: They're not identical, I'm just saying this type of ontology is socially constructed in some sense.
[02/12/2022, 22:10:15] Alex Regueiro: We've also inherited a language with all its historical artefacts
[02/12/2022, 22:10:19] Alex Regueiro: reflective of past ontologies
[02/12/2022, 22:10:21] Alice Lafferty: It doesn't make sense for ontology to be the product of social construction.
[02/12/2022, 22:10:22] Alex Regueiro: but not necessarily current ones
[02/12/2022, 22:10:37] Alice Lafferty: It's a description of an 'inherent' value or quality.
[02/12/2022, 22:10:48] Alice Lafferty: There can't be such a thing as a 'past ontology'.
[02/12/2022, 22:11:00] Alex Regueiro: Okay, you're being a thorough platonist here haha
[02/12/2022, 22:11:04] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[02/12/2022, 22:11:12] Alice Lafferty: Well no
[02/12/2022, 22:11:18] Alex Regueiro: What's your rationale for asserting the existence of such an ontology then?
[02/12/2022, 22:11:28] Alice Lafferty: Because what I'm saying is that we should reject all systems of meaning together.
[02/12/2022, 22:11:31] Alex Regueiro: Especially a timeless, mind-independent one
[02/12/2022, 22:11:57] Alex Regueiro: That's just ontological nihilism though. It's trivially true in some sense, but gets us precisely nowhere!
[02/12/2022, 22:12:44] Alice Lafferty: *by the way I'm talking from a very specific point of view here which I do not endorse in real life and which I think has too narrow a scope.
[02/12/2022, 22:12:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes.
[02/12/2022, 22:13:19] Alex Regueiro: It's a matter just of practicality, I think. If most of its usage is men talking to other men (as a consequence of male domination of the public sphere), they start to become effectively synonyms.
[02/12/2022, 22:13:22] Alice Lafferty: I'm basically presenting two options: platonic nihilism (and metaphysical nihilism generally) or platonism.
[02/12/2022, 22:13:27] Alex Regueiro: I see
[02/12/2022, 22:13:29] Alice Lafferty: There's no 'third' option.
[02/12/2022, 22:13:40] Alex Regueiro: Why?
[02/12/2022, 22:13:54] Alice Lafferty: Because either things have inherent meaning or they do not.
[02/12/2022, 22:14:22] Alex Regueiro: True platonism has no empirical support. Thus I cast it to the flames!
[02/12/2022, 22:14:32] Alice Lafferty: Then you're a platonic nihilist!
[02/12/2022, 22:14:34] Alex Regueiro: What's one with constructing meaning though?
[02/12/2022, 22:14:39] Alice Lafferty: Welcome!
[02/12/2022, 22:14:40] Alex Regueiro: wrong with*
[02/12/2022, 22:14:41] Alex Regueiro: haha
[02/12/2022, 22:14:45] Alex Regueiro: Let's see!
[02/12/2022, 22:15:31] Alice Lafferty: Eh, I'm not sure that culture can really confer meaning.
[02/12/2022, 22:15:45] Alice Lafferty: I think that's giving people too much credit.
[02/12/2022, 22:15:49] Alex Regueiro: Unless "platonic nihilist" just means there is no objective, mind-independent ontology "out there".
[02/12/2022, 22:16:01] Alex Regueiro: Fundamentally we construct meaning at an individual level
[02/12/2022, 22:16:01] Alice Lafferty: Right.
[02/12/2022, 22:16:06] Alex Regueiro: but there are intersubjective aspects to this
[02/12/2022, 22:16:23] Alice Lafferty: I think other levels except the platonic are too flimsy to construct meaning.
[02/12/2022, 22:16:25] Alex Regueiro: all or nearly all our humans minds agree to a large extent on certain basic ontologies of everyday life and the universe
[02/12/2022, 22:16:39] Alex Regueiro: for the simple practicality of living a human life in a human society
[02/12/2022, 22:16:46] Alex Regueiro: this is sort of culture in a nutshell
[02/12/2022, 22:16:50] Alice Lafferty: Exactly - it's just pragmatism.
[02/12/2022, 22:16:58] Alice Lafferty: Or 'social utility'
[02/12/2022, 22:17:33] Alice Lafferty: It's not a comment on what 'actually is'.
[02/12/2022, 22:17:41] Alice Lafferty: You admit this.
[02/12/2022, 22:18:06] Alice Lafferty: Your ontologies are social fictions.
[02/12/2022, 22:18:09] Alex Regueiro: They may seem like they're flimsy, but they're all we have. And since some metaphysics prove much more fruitful (pragmatically) than others, and prove amazingly persistent throughout continuous revisions, there must be some objective truth to them, even if the ontology itself isn't objective.
[02/12/2022, 22:18:27] Alex Regueiro: This sort of comes down to structural realism, which is what one of the essays I sent you was about üôÇ
[02/12/2022, 22:18:31] Alice Lafferty: I don't mean to sound combative by the way.
[02/12/2022, 22:18:34] Alex Regueiro: Obviously in an explicitly scientific context
[02/12/2022, 22:18:41] Alex Regueiro: Don't worry, you don't
[02/12/2022, 22:18:43] Alex Regueiro: We're just debating
[02/12/2022, 22:18:54] Alex Regueiro: Okay... we don't really disagree on this
[02/12/2022, 22:19:06] Alex Regueiro: And yes, I would even call physics a "social fiction" to a certain extent!
[02/12/2022, 22:19:19] Alice Lafferty: 'prove amazingly fruitful' - so we should choose meaning system based on its utility, basically.
[02/12/2022, 22:19:24] Alex Regueiro: In terms of its element-ontology, for sure.
[02/12/2022, 22:19:37] Alex Regueiro: I'm a pragmatist, this is nothing new. üòÄ
[02/12/2022, 22:19:42] Alice Lafferty: No I remember.
[02/12/2022, 22:19:48] Alex Regueiro: oh, you read it already?
[02/12/2022, 22:20:23] Alice Lafferty: At the least, the rejection of platonic forms in maths and the advocacy of maths as a natural science?
[02/12/2022, 22:20:39] Alice Lafferty: I know you sent two but now I've mixed them up.
[02/12/2022, 22:21:02] Alice Lafferty: Huh. Your system is internally coherent I guess.
[02/12/2022, 22:21:10] Alex Regueiro: Maybe even three, if I sent you the one on entropy and information? I forget, sorry
[02/12/2022, 22:21:30] Alex Regueiro: Right. A highly abstracted form of natural science. Though it can be abstracted even from more everyday ontologies.
[02/12/2022, 22:21:49] Alice Lafferty: I personally still struggle with anxiety about the metaphysical status of things and people.
[02/12/2022, 22:22:07] Alice Lafferty: Which you don't think needs accounting for at all.
[02/12/2022, 22:22:09] Alex Regueiro: Just that natural science is sort of the ultimate test. Since it is much more rigorous methdologically, thus vastly easier to arrive at intersubjective truth.
[02/12/2022, 22:22:27] Alice Lafferty: Right, specifically its predictive power?
[02/12/2022, 22:22:46] Alex Regueiro: I think it needs accounting for, I just think its origin is to a very large extent sociocultural.
[02/12/2022, 22:23:03] Alex Regueiro: Yep, and furthermore its resilience across "theory revision"
[02/12/2022, 22:23:43] Alex Regueiro: Since if you don't accept the latter, you end up as a constructive empiricist I think (van Fraassen's theory).
[02/12/2022, 22:24:03] Alice Lafferty: The problem is that people who construct social systems based on their usefulness often then try to impute 'essential' or 'ontological' characteristics to them.
[02/12/2022, 22:25:13] Alex Regueiro: It is also founded upon some objective structure of the universe, I'd say, though since we're talking about sociology and culture here, we're very far out in the Quinean "ontological web".
[02/12/2022, 22:25:27] Alice Lafferty: Eg. It's socially useful for males to control their female sexual partners -> males have inherent authority granted by God.
[02/12/2022, 22:25:36] Alex Regueiro: I know so little about ontology, but I suspect this is true, yeah.
[02/12/2022, 22:25:45] Alex Regueiro: Pragmatism need not mean truth pragmatism
[02/12/2022, 22:25:50] Alex Regueiro: It can be power pragmatism, if you will
[02/12/2022, 22:25:52] Alice Lafferty: 'It's also founded upon some objective structure of the universe' -???
[02/12/2022, 22:25:59] Alex Regueiro: Which is what you seem to be alluding to
[02/12/2022, 22:26:20] Alex Regueiro: Err, this is really difficult to explain online! Maybe my paper does to some extent but...
[02/12/2022, 22:26:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes pragmatism is not wedded to 'truth' at all. Doesn't that bother you?
[02/12/2022, 22:27:08] Alex Regueiro: The fundamental tenet (though it's really more a rational-empirical conclusion) of structuralism realism is that "structure" is real, while entities are not.
[02/12/2022, 22:27:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes I remember this from the essay.
[02/12/2022, 22:27:29] Alex Regueiro: It used to, perhaps. But not any more. After all, I was a subjective idealist for a while!
[02/12/2022, 22:27:39] Alice Lafferty: This is mereological nihilsm though right?
[02/12/2022, 22:28:03] Alice Lafferty: Eg. There's no such thing as a table, there are only 'mereological simples arranged table-wise'.
[02/12/2022, 22:28:07] Alex Regueiro: Kind of. What you call "nihilism" (I see why) I would often call "constructivism" though
[02/12/2022, 22:28:21] Alice Lafferty: Is that an accurate analogy?
[02/12/2022, 22:29:06] Alice Lafferty: Although begs the question of what 'mereological simples' are...
[02/12/2022, 22:29:08] Alex Regueiro: I don't believe in mereology being particularly fundamental, for the record
[02/12/2022, 22:29:20] Alex Regueiro: It's just one way of analysing/deconstructing our world.
[02/12/2022, 22:29:24] Alex Regueiro: Valid in part
[02/12/2022, 22:30:16] Alex Regueiro: Structure in structural realism is an abstract notion, though it can be made pretty concrete through mathematics and a pragmatic lens.
[02/12/2022, 22:30:42] Alice Lafferty: So you might say parts-wholes are not 'real' in any sense.
[02/12/2022, 22:30:47] Alex Regueiro: Nope
[02/12/2022, 22:30:51] Alex Regueiro: They haver no privileged position
[02/12/2022, 22:30:57] Alice Lafferty: I see
[02/12/2022, 22:31:02] Alex Regueiro: ontologically
[02/12/2022, 22:31:12] Alex Regueiro: No ontology is objectively privileged in fact
[02/12/2022, 22:31:30] Alex Regueiro: Only its structure can be said to be real (when we talk about a "good" scientific theory in some sense)
[02/12/2022, 22:31:38] Alex Regueiro: some... well-defined sense
[02/12/2022, 22:32:24] Alice Lafferty: When you use the word structure, doesn't that necessarily imply parts
[02/12/2022, 22:33:39] Alice Lafferty: Even if it's all purely relational, there still need to be identifiable nodes in a nexus of relations... if you see what I mean.
[02/12/2022, 22:33:47] Alex Regueiro: I can see why you think that, but this sort of structure is best identified formally with an isomorphism class of mathematical structures ("mathematical structure" having its own precise meaning, but it can be defined set-theoretically or category-theoreitcally, for example)
[02/12/2022, 22:34:10] Alex Regueiro: Yes. But the actual significance of those nodes is not intrinsic, but only comes from the overall structure and relations.
[02/12/2022, 22:34:28] Alex Regueiro: What you seem to be getting at is the difference between ante-rem and in-rem structuralism
[02/12/2022, 22:34:43] Alex Regueiro: which is a subject of ongoing philosophy!
[02/12/2022, 22:34:48] Alex Regueiro: especially in mathematics
[02/12/2022, 22:34:52] Alice Lafferty: Huh, and this is a good analogy for your theory that meaning is produced socially.
[02/12/2022, 22:35:09] Alice Lafferty: I'm afraid I don't know what those terms mean.
[02/12/2022, 22:35:14] Alex Regueiro: I mean, we've sort of digressed into science here, but the fundamentals are the same
[02/12/2022, 22:35:41] Alex Regueiro: No reason you should. Just something for you to look up if you're curious. I'd struggle to give you a clear explanation myself right now!
[02/12/2022, 22:36:27] Alex Regueiro: Recalling some of your Latin, you can get an idea anyway üòÄ
[02/12/2022, 22:36:36] Alex Regueiro: in-re*
[02/12/2022, 22:36:38] Alice Lafferty: I'm just thinking about this paragraph.
[02/12/2022, 22:36:44] Alex Regueiro: okay üôÇ
[02/12/2022, 22:37:34] Alex Regueiro: I think the last section of my essay deals with that the most clearly. Though it might assume too much background familiarity with bits of maths/logic
[02/12/2022, 22:37:51] Alice Lafferty: Is this just the difference between meanings inhering in structures or being produced by the interactions themselves...
[02/12/2022, 22:37:53] Alex Regueiro: This aspect of structural realism seems to be where philosophers diverge somewhat
[02/12/2022, 22:39:05] Alex Regueiro: That sounds fair.
[02/12/2022, 22:39:33] Alex Regueiro: Structuralists disagree a great deal over what existence we should attribute to structures themselves... if any
[02/12/2022, 22:39:57] Alex Regueiro: and if they're contingent on instantiation (in-re structuralism)
[02/12/2022, 22:40:03] Alex Regueiro: Hope that makes a bit of sense
[02/12/2022, 22:40:16] Alice Lafferty: If the entire world is 'just' structure, how can anything be isolated and identified.
[02/12/2022, 22:40:35] Alice Lafferty: I think I don't fully understand the way the term is being used here...
[02/12/2022, 22:40:45] Alex Regueiro: Well, some structural realists say it's just "structure all the way down" (adapted from turtles!)
[02/12/2022, 22:41:04] Alex Regueiro: I take issue with that though
[02/12/2022, 22:41:24] Alex Regueiro: I say we have to posit the entities in order to then talk about structure
[02/12/2022, 22:41:29] Alice Lafferty: So can we say that anything differs from anything else, or that all reality is essentially of the same substance.
[02/12/2022, 22:41:52] Alice Lafferty: Or I know you would say there 'is no substance'!
[02/12/2022, 22:42:06] Alex Regueiro: I suppose the ones who assert it's "structures all the way down" are monists in some sense, though they probably wouldn't call themselves that.
[02/12/2022, 22:42:20] Alice Lafferty: Right this is what I was getting at.
[02/12/2022, 22:42:25] Alex Regueiro: I don't really like the whole monism/dualism/pluralism debate
[02/12/2022, 22:42:36] Alex Regueiro: It sort of misses the point, to me
[02/12/2022, 22:42:38] Alice Lafferty: It seems relevant here.
[02/12/2022, 22:42:44] Alice Lafferty: Go on?
[02/12/2022, 22:44:03] Alex Regueiro: I can see it being relevant for certain types of structural realist, but since I assert that we construct ontologies (and even the metaphysical relations) ourselves, it's sort of beside the point. We get to decide what is and isn't the same "substance", and then reap the consequences ‚Äì good or bad, predictive or useless, whatever the pragmatic context is.
[02/12/2022, 22:44:39] Alice Lafferty: That in some sense things do not exist unless relationally.
‚Äé[02/12/2022, 22:44:52] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[02/12/2022, 22:46:00] Alice Lafferty: 'We construct ontologies' - do you believe that the mind occasions spontaneous new events/relations uncaused by the physical world...
[02/12/2022, 22:46:56] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I see a bit better now.
[02/12/2022, 22:47:23] Alex Regueiro: No, though I'm not too worried about how we construct them for the purpose of this argument.
[02/12/2022, 22:47:38] Alice Lafferty: Physical objects are linguistic conveniences basically.
[02/12/2022, 22:47:45] Alice Lafferty: *or social rather
[02/12/2022, 22:48:50] Alex Regueiro: Yes, social ones. I mean, in theory you could have your own purely internal ontologies and language and not share them with anyone, but in practice they are social/intersubjective conventions.
[02/12/2022, 22:49:24] Alex Regueiro: (Here I disagree with Wittgenstein.)
[02/12/2022, 22:49:47] Alice Lafferty: I do enjoy your kind of 'whatever works' approach.
[02/12/2022, 22:50:53] Alice Lafferty: Huh, I disagree with both of you a bit. I agree with Wittgenstein that private languages are impossible, but I also believe that ontologies can be pre-linguistic.
[02/12/2022, 22:50:58] Alex Regueiro: Haha. It almost looks anarchist at first, doesn't it? Until you catch yourself and rein things in by empirical-rational constraints.
[02/12/2022, 22:51:37] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps it's just a semantic point here. I can quite easily imagine a "private language", but is it a language in the ordinary sense?
[02/12/2022, 22:51:58] Alex Regueiro: I would argue it still shows enough features of "language", but...
[02/12/2022, 22:52:19] Alice Lafferty: I guess I still haven't quite grasped the nature of this 'structure' esp because it is clearly not uniform across time and space (unless time and space are themselves 'structure').
[02/12/2022, 22:52:55] Alex Regueiro: Maybe my understanding of private language is too basic though. I need to read up on it really.
[02/12/2022, 22:53:07] Alex Regueiro: In what way wouldn't it be uniform?
[02/12/2022, 22:53:17] Alice Lafferty: Can you? If you use a bare-bones definition of a language as just semiotics then maybe.
[02/12/2022, 22:53:33] Alice Lafferty: In that case animals 'have' language.
[02/12/2022, 22:53:52] Alex Regueiro: Right. I think Wittgenstein's concept of language may rely on translatability too.
[02/12/2022, 22:54:11] Alice Lafferty: There is more/less/different kinds of stuff in different places üòê
[02/12/2022, 22:54:18] Alex Regueiro: I will have to prevaricate here...
[02/12/2022, 22:54:50] Alice Lafferty: Or you have to at least acknowledge a difference in density?
[02/12/2022, 22:54:58] Alice Lafferty: Or complexity?
[02/12/2022, 22:56:18] Alice Lafferty: I think so. I never read the Tractus, only Philosophical Investigations to be fair. But a language is more than just the capacity to link Sign A with Phenomenon B.
[02/12/2022, 22:56:30] Alex Regueiro: We need to be clear what frame of reference we're using here. I'm a post-rem structuralist, so I wouldn't claim structure has any sort of platonic existence. Only it can be instantiated in the mind.
[02/12/2022, 22:56:46] Alice Lafferty: Oh a third option...
[02/12/2022, 22:56:56] Alex Regueiro: That's the more interesting one I hear.
[02/12/2022, 22:57:09] Alex Regueiro: But you're still doing better than me, who has only read excerpts plus secondary sources...
[02/12/2022, 22:57:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok..
[02/12/2022, 22:58:50] Alex Regueiro: Hope I haven't lost you? I'm giving pretty cursory explanations here, in truth
[02/12/2022, 22:59:17] Alex Regueiro: Because it's super hard to be thorough and rigorous through the medium of WhatsApp!
[02/12/2022, 23:00:14] Alex Regueiro: BTW there's a BBC biography of Wittgenstein's that's wonderful. As if you needed/wanted more recommendations... just thought I'd mention it!
[02/12/2022, 23:00:19] Alex Regueiro: Wittgenstein's life*
[02/12/2022, 23:00:37] Alice Lafferty: But (directed towards you and Quine)  you don't believe that the world is literally conjured up by human pragmatism. This is the question of what you believe is actually 'out there'.
[02/12/2022, 23:01:29] Alice Lafferty: Or is this a purely utilitarian metaphysic which remains silent on 'truth claims'?
[02/12/2022, 23:01:55] Alice Lafferty: Thanks, I will look!
[02/12/2022, 23:01:56] Alex Regueiro: Good question
[02/12/2022, 23:02:17] Alex Regueiro: Part of a series alongside ones on Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx
[02/12/2022, 23:02:44] Alice Lafferty: Is it new or?
[02/12/2022, 23:02:49] Alice Lafferty: Archived?
[02/12/2022, 23:03:10] Alex Regueiro: Not super old, but more than a few years old, I think... they're all on Youtube. One sec, I'll find the name if you like.
[02/12/2022, 23:03:24] Alice Lafferty: Otherwise it is just subjective idealism (again).
[02/12/2022, 23:03:47] Alex Regueiro: Yes, it really. AS an ex-subjective idealist perhaps I haven't given enough thought to this.
[02/12/2022, 23:04:02] Alex Regueiro: I suppose the ante-rem structuralists have a quick escape!
[02/12/2022, 23:04:26] Alice Lafferty: Isn't 'ante-rem structuralism' just... platonism
[02/12/2022, 23:04:29] Alex Regueiro: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07gpjmm
[02/12/2022, 23:04:42] Alex Regueiro: Full episodes you can just search on Google or Youtube üôÇ
[02/12/2022, 23:05:02] Alice Lafferty: Thanks. Interested to see what their takes are going to be.
[02/12/2022, 23:05:05] Alex Regueiro: In a way yes. But it's platonic about structure rather than entities or anything else.
[02/12/2022, 23:05:20] Alice Lafferty: I say potato...
[02/12/2022, 23:05:54] Alice Lafferty: I can't believe this was just a circuitous way of informing me that you are indeed still a subjective idealist.
[02/12/2022, 23:05:58] Alex Regueiro: haha
[02/12/2022, 23:06:10] Alex Regueiro: I suppose I would actually say the structure is real, though we only have access to its instantiations.
[02/12/2022, 23:06:29] Alex Regueiro: So maybe I am a quasi-platonist. üòß
[02/12/2022, 23:06:33] Alice Lafferty: I'm kidding - I appreciate the nuance between entities and structure.
[02/12/2022, 23:06:41] Alex Regueiro: Hah I know
[02/12/2022, 23:06:44] Alice Lafferty: I think that's a useful elaboration.
[02/12/2022, 23:06:54] Alex Regueiro: Thanks for drawing this out of me
[02/12/2022, 23:07:07] Alex Regueiro: Got me thinking about the deep questions pertaining to structuralism realism for the first time in ages
[02/12/2022, 23:07:28] Alice Lafferty: Does Quine address this anywhere?
[02/12/2022, 23:08:22] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[02/12/2022, 23:08:49] Alex Regueiro: Quine didn't even structural realism, to be clear. It took a while for these problems to be elaborated and discussed. Quine was actually platonic-pragmatist about mathematics (you can look up the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument, which is kind of weak in one sense).
[02/12/2022, 23:08:52] Alex Regueiro: didn't invent*
[02/12/2022, 23:09:22] Alice Lafferty: This seems to contradict the post-rem structuralism?
[02/12/2022, 23:09:31] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I take that back!
[02/12/2022, 23:09:35] Alex Regueiro: I'm probably ante-rem haha
[02/12/2022, 23:09:57] Alex Regueiro: Though I refute Benacerraf's issue with ante-rem, in that it's epistemically inaccessible
[02/12/2022, 23:10:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes you offered a kind of argument along the same lines in one of your papers right
[02/12/2022, 23:10:27] Alex Regueiro: Since we can use mathematics to describe such structures
[02/12/2022, 23:10:31] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[02/12/2022, 23:10:45] Alice Lafferty: This is surprising because I thought he strongly rejected platonism.
[02/12/2022, 23:10:51] Alex Regueiro: I mean, to be fair, I do show some sympathy to platonism in the most tangential way possible, in my philosophy of maths essay
[02/12/2022, 23:11:17] Alex Regueiro: We have to be clearer what we mean by platonism here
[02/12/2022, 23:11:19] Alice Lafferty: I thought you said it was not empirically viable!
[02/12/2022, 23:11:23] Alex Regueiro: In a sense yes, in a sense no
[02/12/2022, 23:11:54] Alice Lafferty: Oh the difference between 'discovering' and 'inventing' numbers in his case?
[02/12/2022, 23:12:12] Alex Regueiro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(philosophy_of_science)#Ontic_structural_realism
[02/12/2022, 23:12:16] Alex Regueiro: (short helpful paragraph)
[02/12/2022, 23:12:30] Alice Lafferty: By the way I'm missing at least 60% of these conversations because I don't know any maths.
[02/12/2022, 23:12:44] Alex Regueiro: So my supervisor James Ladyman was actually the one who first elucidated ontic vs. epistemic structural realism back in the late 90s
[02/12/2022, 23:13:20] Alex Regueiro: I think you're doing an impressive job of grasping the concepts for someone who has no formal maths education at higher level!
[02/12/2022, 23:14:13] Alice Lafferty: 'There are no identifiable objects with intrinsic properties' - I'm very amenable to this argument.
[02/12/2022, 23:14:55] Alex Regueiro: Right. This is fundamental to OSR.
[02/12/2022, 23:16:04] Alice Lafferty: I think I'd already come to it in a slightly different route.
[02/12/2022, 23:16:26] Alice Lafferty: I don't know, perhaps it has more explanatory power than I give it credit but
[02/12/2022, 23:17:07] Alex Regueiro: Yes, its success is sort of subtle, I'd say.
[02/12/2022, 23:17:11] Alice Lafferty: these theories seem preoccupied with the configuration of reality rather than its sort of existence-status.
[02/12/2022, 23:17:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, because existence is sort of arbitrary at some level
[02/12/2022, 23:17:51] Alex Regueiro: How we divvy up the universe depends on what discipline we're working in, and what our aims are even.
[02/12/2022, 23:19:04] Alice Lafferty: Is it more so a theoretical tool with which to do better science, rather than like purely expository?
[02/12/2022, 23:19:20] Alex Regueiro: Is what, specifically?
[02/12/2022, 23:19:26] Alice Lafferty: ?
[02/12/2022, 23:19:36] Alice Lafferty: Structural realism
[02/12/2022, 23:20:23] Alex Regueiro: Does a person exist? Is it their body that exists? Or should we only say their individual atoms exists? Or do they even exist definitely, given the quantum mechanical caveats?
[02/12/2022, 23:20:27] Alex Regueiro: just for example
[02/12/2022, 23:20:28] Alice Lafferty: Is it considered a hopeless cause to try and give an account of reality then.
[02/12/2022, 23:20:49] Alex Regueiro: You can easily quibble over the existence or "reality" of anything, especially abstract things, but even more concrete/physical objects we take for granted
[02/12/2022, 23:21:27] Alice Lafferty: Right.. is it just chance and fluctuations at a very basic level?
[02/12/2022, 23:21:31] Alex Regueiro: We can give *an* account, but it will only ever be one, isomorphic to other equally good ones (in terms of predictive power) within the structure of reality.
[02/12/2022, 23:21:53] Alex Regueiro: Don't get me going about QM, that's a convo for another time! (You don't want me to right now, trust me.)
[02/12/2022, 23:22:00] Alex Regueiro: Some would argue that, but not me
[02/12/2022, 23:22:05] Alice Lafferty: Oh, would you say this the prevailing mood in modern philosophy?
[02/12/2022, 23:22:15] Alex Regueiro: not really no
[02/12/2022, 23:22:31] Alex Regueiro: structural realists are still a minority, albeit a sizeable one
[02/12/2022, 23:22:31] Alice Lafferty: But isn't that central to the question.
[02/12/2022, 23:22:47] Alex Regueiro: It's actually become quite popular among working theoretical physicists, I'm told
[02/12/2022, 23:23:39] Alex Regueiro: It's a conceptual framework. That's how I'd put it. Or a method for elucidation.
[02/12/2022, 23:24:16] Alice Lafferty: In trying to reduce reality to its 'mereological simples' (sorry!), quantum mechanics is our access point?
[02/12/2022, 23:24:26] Alice Lafferty: Interesting
[02/12/2022, 23:25:25] Alice Lafferty: Ie objects>atoms>subatomic particles>quarks>.....
[02/12/2022, 23:26:03] Alice Lafferty: Beneath which there is some 'underlying structure'.
[02/12/2022, 23:26:06] Alice Lafferty: Of some kind
[02/12/2022, 23:26:17] Alex Regueiro: Hah you do like that term! I'm not sure I believe there are such things. Reminds me a bit of "causal set theory", which I know virtually nothing about, mind you
[02/12/2022, 23:26:27] Alex Regueiro: I think this is conflating structure with entities
[02/12/2022, 23:26:43] Alex Regueiro: just a category error
[02/12/2022, 23:26:54] Alice Lafferty: Aren't what we perceive as entities made up of structure
[02/12/2022, 23:27:37] Alice Lafferty: I'm not positing the actual existence of objects, that was just a historical progression of understanding.
[02/12/2022, 23:27:54] Alex Regueiro: I get the temptation to say this, but I think it's better to say they instantiate structures.
[02/12/2022, 23:28:07] Alex Regueiro: What we perceive as entities is very context-dependent
[02/12/2022, 23:28:23] Alex Regueiro: In the case of quarks, it's totally posited for its explanatory and predictive power.
[02/12/2022, 23:28:26] Alice Lafferty: I know! I found mereology really helpful in getting me to the point of 'entities are not real'.
[02/12/2022, 23:28:49] Alice Lafferty: Really I didn't know this.
[02/12/2022, 23:29:07] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I can get that, even I'd then sort of "chuck away the ladder" of mereology, personally!
[02/12/2022, 23:29:44] Alex Regueiro: We can't observe them directly in any sense. But the theory we have for them is very effective...
[02/12/2022, 23:29:54] Alice Lafferty: This has been incredibly disillusioning for me you know. I was under the impression that scientist and even philosophers were genuinely in the business of describing reality, not 'making predictive models'.
[02/12/2022, 23:30:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[02/12/2022, 23:30:05] Alex Regueiro: Pragmatism üôåüèº
[02/12/2022, 23:31:04] Alice Lafferty: Ok, so objects are purely mental phenomena.
[02/12/2022, 23:31:10] Alex Regueiro: Hah. I'm sure many would still claim that. Like I said, structural realism is increasingly popular among working scientists. But you'd be hard-pressed to find any subjective realist! All the rest would be traditional (entity) realists.
[02/12/2022, 23:32:05] Alex Regueiro: Right, you might even be able to call them "ideas" in the Kantian sense. But I prefer your description.
[02/12/2022, 23:32:06] Alice Lafferty: What is there relationship to structure? What is it about the brain that is able to pick out or hallucinate 'entities' from 'just' structure?
[02/12/2022, 23:32:31] Alice Lafferty: *their relationship
[02/12/2022, 23:33:29] Alice Lafferty: Again a lot of these questions are epistemological at bottom. Sorry
[02/12/2022, 23:33:31] Alex Regueiro: Good question again! I would say our very perceptions are just structural relations.
[02/12/2022, 23:34:07] Alex Regueiro: I won't pretend I have a complete theory of how the mind works though. At some level I just accept phenomenal experience.
[02/12/2022, 23:34:18] Alice Lafferty: But the brain is itself 'not an entity'. It is just structure.
[02/12/2022, 23:34:38] Alice Lafferty: How can there even be private mental experiences if brains do not 'actually' exist
[02/12/2022, 23:35:12] Alex Regueiro: My suspicion is that we're running into limitations with language here
[02/12/2022, 23:35:42] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure these questions have answers that would satisfy us
[02/12/2022, 23:36:07] Alice Lafferty: I struggle to understand how subjective experience can arise from this 'structure'....  it would have to be capable of perceiving itself, which is incoherent.
[02/12/2022, 23:36:24] Alex Regueiro: Now we're into the area of the hard problem of consciousness.
[02/12/2022, 23:36:27] Alex Regueiro: Good times
[02/12/2022, 23:36:43] Alice Lafferty: Probably.
[02/12/2022, 23:37:26] Alice Lafferty: It's funny how it does continue to throw a spanner in the works.
[02/12/2022, 23:37:52] Alex Regueiro: I might have to repeat one of the very first things I said to you, about it being a category error between subjective/phenomenal experience and scientific theory. I do concede it's not very satisfying though, even if it does provide a valid answer, I'd say.
[02/12/2022, 23:37:53] Alice Lafferty: I think the only compatible solution is that consciousness is kind of an an epiphenomenon.
[02/12/2022, 23:38:08] Alice Lafferty: Yes I remember!
[02/12/2022, 23:38:53] Alice Lafferty: Like 'steam coming off a train'. That doesn't contradict structural realism.
[02/12/2022, 23:39:10] Alex Regueiro: If this means what I think it does, sounds reasonable. I like the idea of a multi-layered reality, or whatever philosophers call it. It's very compatible with structural realism and pragmatism, I'd argue.
[02/12/2022, 23:39:45] Alice Lafferty: Honestly, I don't get more broadly how the brain can just 'imagine' objects. I think some distinguishing qualities must inhere in the real world in order for us to perceive them, ultimately.
[02/12/2022, 23:39:48] Alex Regueiro: You definitely gave me the most intelligent reply I've gotten on OKC!
[02/12/2022, 23:40:15] Alex Regueiro: Not that my sample size is particularly large...
[02/12/2022, 23:40:23] Alex Regueiro: But slightly unexpected nonetheless
[02/12/2022, 23:40:34] Alice Lafferty: So as you say ante-res or in-re.
[02/12/2022, 23:40:44] Alex Regueiro: Nor do I. I think we may be seeking an explanation that we're just incapable of.
[02/12/2022, 23:40:47] Alice Lafferty: Haha, how is it going on there by the way
[02/12/2022, 23:41:03] Alex Regueiro: At some level we have to accept things "just are" that way.
[02/12/2022, 23:41:09] Alex Regueiro: right
[02/12/2022, 23:41:25] Alex Regueiro: Oh I haven't really been using it. I'll sometimes open it or another app when I get a new like, that's it.
[02/12/2022, 23:41:47] Alice Lafferty: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent"
[02/12/2022, 23:42:21] Alex Regueiro: Yes!
[02/12/2022, 23:42:25] Alex Regueiro: Wise words
[02/12/2022, 23:43:06] Alex Regueiro: A lot of the appeal of structural realism is its humility, its very modest (conservative!) epistemological foundations
[02/12/2022, 23:43:16] Alex Regueiro: nay, and ontological
[02/12/2022, 23:43:33] Alice Lafferty: Yes I can see that.
[02/12/2022, 23:43:52] Alice Lafferty: Although I do also appreciate the more audacious attempts to give a grand theory of everything.
[02/12/2022, 23:44:44] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to go and walk my dog round the block.
[02/12/2022, 23:44:55] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough I got a message from a woman I'd chatted to a tiny bit previously the day of our cancelled date and all that jazz. We talked a bit more, and she seemed really nice, it was just so vapid.
[02/12/2022, 23:45:12] Alex Regueiro: So what I'm trying to say is, thank you for the stimulating intellectual conversation. üôÇ
[02/12/2022, 23:45:27] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good. How's he doing getting around these days?
[02/12/2022, 23:45:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha! I met lots of people like that on OKC.
[02/12/2022, 23:45:59] Alex Regueiro: It's very very attractive, but I suppose I have a bit of the postmodernist in me that shouts "caution"! Or maybe it's just my conservative proclivities.
[02/12/2022, 23:46:28] Alex Regueiro: Really banal opening messages, or banal ensuing conversations?
[02/12/2022, 23:46:31] Alice Lafferty: To be fair maybe people are reasonably quite guarded on there and not keen to jump into a discussion on consciousness or whatever.
[02/12/2022, 23:46:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah hah
[02/12/2022, 23:46:42] Alex Regueiro: It's not the most typical icebreaker, is it?
[02/12/2022, 23:46:51] Alice Lafferty: Very well. He's a little stoic.
[02/12/2022, 23:46:54] Alex Regueiro: Takes a weirdo like me to jump onto that question
[02/12/2022, 23:47:47] Alice Lafferty: I put in my profile as a kind of 'I'd be interested in talking about this!' invitation.
[02/12/2022, 23:47:53] Alice Lafferty: Sadly barely picked up on.
[02/12/2022, 23:48:05] Alice Lafferty: Otherwise, how else are you supposed to get to know someone organically?
[02/12/2022, 23:48:12] Alex Regueiro: Praise be to Marcus Aurelius!
[02/12/2022, 23:48:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I'm really glad you did. Opening exchanges can be so superficial and insipid otherwise.
[02/12/2022, 23:48:55] Alex Regueiro: It's not like real life where it's much easier to go off on a spur.

[04/12/2022, 21:13:10] Alex Regueiro: Where'd you see this? Are you playing around with Python more?
[06/12/2022, 08:38:05] Alice Lafferty: Have you been using GPT-3.5?
[06/12/2022, 08:38:46] Alice Lafferty: Twitter. I have to say Twitter provides such great value at times like this.
[06/12/2022, 08:39:02] Alice Lafferty: *didn't mean to send thumbs up :s
[06/12/2022, 08:40:29] Alice Lafferty: I'm seeing some apocalyptic takes but I'm sure it's all just part of the hype.

[06/12/2022, 18:11:21] Alex Regueiro: I haven't. My practical experience with ML and AI is sadly very limited. I plan to fix that soon!
[06/12/2022, 18:11:33] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes it does.
[06/12/2022, 18:12:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, there's so much hype in this space that even the experts occasionally buy into into it...
[06/12/2022, 18:14:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, interesting! Unsurprising perhaps though, since its understanding of these questions is very superficial. Almost entirely restricted to the linguistic level and very basic arithmetic, I think? I don't know if it could solve that simple "equation" if it's expressed more explicitly, but from what I've seen its ability to reason is severely restricted.
[06/12/2022, 18:15:38] Alex Regueiro: Always happy to be sent stuff like this. I don't even actively follow the news in this area. üôÇ
[06/12/2022, 18:15:42] Alex Regueiro: So thank you
[06/12/2022, 18:15:53] Alex Regueiro: Did you catch the England game?
[06/12/2022, 18:16:45] Alex Regueiro: I just saw Spain put in a rather unimaginative performance and then miss all their penalties heh. Shocking.

[06/12/2022, 18:18:29] Alex Regueiro: (In case you need some light relief from the serious of the football!)
[06/12/2022, 20:51:37] Alice Lafferty: I think it's just mainly Sam Altman
[06/12/2022, 20:51:53] Alice Lafferty: Against Senegal? Yes
[06/12/2022, 20:52:39] Alice Lafferty: Do you subscribe the anglopessimism re the France game.
[06/12/2022, 20:55:22] Alice Lafferty: Right.. I think everyone's agreed to just drop the pretence of concern.
[06/12/2022, 22:21:51] Alex Regueiro: I'm thinking mainly of that Google employee who was fired... mainly the experts offer some balance to the hyper, but occasionally...
[06/12/2022, 22:22:21] Alex Regueiro: Oh, my impression was one of unbridled optimism from the media and pundits, though then again I've only really seen BBC and ITV coverage!
[06/12/2022, 22:22:53] Alex Regueiro: I make France favourites, for sure, but on the day we could definitely win. üôÇ
[06/12/2022, 22:24:02] Alex Regueiro: I do think it's fair to separate the enjoyment of the football and the tournament from the circumstances surrounding its hosting... but yes, that's quite true when it comes to the myriad virtue signallers.
[06/12/2022, 22:25:03] Alex Regueiro: Read any more Burke, incidentally?
[06/12/2022, 23:50:48] Alice Lafferty: Bookmakers are giving France the slight edge apparently.
[06/12/2022, 23:51:18] Alice Lafferty: But we'll see
[06/12/2022, 23:51:28] Alice Lafferty: I haven't! Have you?
[06/12/2022, 23:55:11] Alex Regueiro: English bookmakers I presume. I believe the odds differ significantly based on country!
[06/12/2022, 23:57:00] Alex Regueiro: Which can even make for good arbitrage opportunities, if you're willing to go to the effort...
[07/12/2022, 22:38:30] Alex Regueiro: I somehow don't feel terribly emotionally invested in England this WC. Probably just as well. Will still cheer them on, mind you
[07/12/2022, 22:38:57] Alex Regueiro: How's your week going? Anything interesting?
[07/12/2022, 22:39:22] Alex Regueiro: Concert on Friday should be great. Looking forward to it!
[07/12/2022, 22:40:04] Alex Regueiro: Just got back from London. Thank god tomorrow is a quieter day. 3 days in London in a row is a nightmare for me.
[07/12/2022, 22:40:54] Alex Regueiro: Presume you're still good for that. üòä When shall we meet up?
[07/12/2022, 23:13:49] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, forgot to reply to this... no! It's on my list, though not sure when I'll get around to it. Was just curious because you mentioned it last week. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 00:18:16] Alice Lafferty: I've never been that interested in football but the atmosphere in my house when a match is playing is powerfully contagious!
[08/12/2022, 00:18:20] Alice Lafferty: I'm basically enjoying it.
[08/12/2022, 00:18:38] Alice Lafferty: What have you been doing there?
[08/12/2022, 00:19:42] Alice Lafferty: Is it a 7:30pm start again?
[08/12/2022, 00:20:05] Alice Lafferty: If so we can say 7:00 or 7:15 or something?
[08/12/2022, 00:45:50] Alex Regueiro: Haha I bet! A dad and two brothers who all love football?
[08/12/2022, 00:46:14] Alex Regueiro: My dad could barely be less interested in football. Even my mum is following the World Cup more.
[08/12/2022, 00:47:13] Alex Regueiro: At least I can chat to my sis a bit... not that she's a big fan either, but living in a football-mad country and all! Plus, she got me to provide all the predictions for her office competition. Not that I'm much help.
[08/12/2022, 00:48:15] Alex Regueiro: I'm glad! It's genuinely good fun. The knockout stage has all the drama too.
[08/12/2022, 00:52:20] Alex Regueiro: Meeting up some people from the entrepreneurship programme that I did just before Bristol. First time since then. The heady days of the pandemic. Literally caught it in the office first week there.
[08/12/2022, 00:52:27] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[08/12/2022, 00:53:06] Alex Regueiro: Either works with me. Would you rather play it safer or...?
[08/12/2022, 01:02:03] Alice Lafferty: Argentina's doing pretty well, right?
[08/12/2022, 01:02:58] Alice Lafferty: Oh nice, so not work related?
[08/12/2022, 01:03:00] Alex Regueiro: Efectivamente
[08/12/2022, 01:03:15] Alex Regueiro: After the shocking first-game loss to Saudi Arabia, slowly improving.
[08/12/2022, 01:03:45] Alice Lafferty: Haven't been watching per se but just looked at the scores.
[08/12/2022, 01:03:53] Alex Regueiro: I mean, the programme was kind of work. We got paid for it. But yeah this was just a drink & dinner.
[08/12/2022, 01:04:11] Alice Lafferty: Niceüëå
[08/12/2022, 01:05:54] Alex Regueiro: Two of the guys I knew pretty well. I teamed up with one to explore ideas, before we went our own ways. The second guy I teamed up with (not there) was interested in nuclear fusion hah. He has his fusion startup now! Great fellow, but can't say I'm overly optimistic...
[08/12/2022, 01:06:11] Alex Regueiro: OpenAI and GPT actually came up in conversation üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 01:06:39] Alice Lafferty: Within his/our lifetime does he think?
[08/12/2022, 01:07:20] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, what was their verdict? Overhyped or genuinely catastrophic or?
[08/12/2022, 01:08:31] Alex Regueiro: Well, he'd be a pretty poor businessman if he didn't believe he could reach it in his lifetime hah. He's only gotten minor funding so far, but in theory he's got the right experience... I don't know enough to say more really.
[08/12/2022, 01:09:09] Alex Regueiro: They were cautiously impressed  I'd say, though it just so happened I was the only techie there!
[08/12/2022, 01:16:12] Alice Lafferty: I mean, do you think that belief is well-supported?
[08/12/2022, 01:19:21] Alice Lafferty: By the way, I have looked again and am not sure I will be able to make Friday after all because I'm going to Manchester very early Saturday morning. Sorry! You have people you can ask instead?
[08/12/2022, 01:22:19] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. I think he's very optimistic. It's a moonshot. But having private innovation in this space can only be a good thing, and I reckon one of those companies could well make the breakthrough (sustained fusion, net energy output) in the next 20 years or so, with a bit of luck.
[08/12/2022, 01:22:24] Alex Regueiro: Oh dear...
[08/12/2022, 01:23:03] Alex Regueiro: I could try, but obviously not ideal.
[08/12/2022, 01:23:07] Alex Regueiro: Are you sure you can't come still? It will be over by ~9:30 and you can head straight back.
[08/12/2022, 01:23:45] Alice Lafferty: Who were you going to go with if I hadn't been able to come?
[08/12/2022, 01:23:46] Alice Lafferty: Sorry
[08/12/2022, 01:24:04] Alex Regueiro: You can't pass up the chance to see a world-class pianist with your favourite and awful amateur pianist, surely?!
[08/12/2022, 01:24:12] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure heh
[08/12/2022, 01:24:22] Alex Regueiro: Would have to think
[08/12/2022, 01:25:17] Alice Lafferty: It's very true, I could go. It's just energetically costly for me to travel that much within 24 hours.
[08/12/2022, 01:25:22] Alice Lafferty: I'm just being precious really.
[08/12/2022, 01:25:46] Alice Lafferty: If you can't get anyone at such short notice and don't want to go alone, then I still obviously CAN come.
[08/12/2022, 01:25:54] Alex Regueiro: Aww
[08/12/2022, 01:26:00] Alex Regueiro: Well I don't want to twist your arm into going
[08/12/2022, 01:26:23] Alex Regueiro: I lie... I'm quite disposed to a little bit of arm-twisting.
[08/12/2022, 01:26:41] Alice Lafferty: I should have actually checked parents' schedule earlier so that was my fault.
[08/12/2022, 01:26:54] Alex Regueiro: I do sympathise. Travelling a lot in a short time sucks.
[08/12/2022, 01:27:49] Alice Lafferty: Your dad would be interested?
[08/12/2022, 01:28:53] Alex Regueiro: Is this a family trip up to the beautiful industrial Venice of the North?
[08/12/2022, 01:29:07] Alex Regueiro: Possibly
[08/12/2022, 01:29:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes, we're going to see my brother.
[08/12/2022, 01:29:48] Alex Regueiro: I'd have more fun introducing a friend to a great pianist though. (I took my parents to see a performance by him last year)
[08/12/2022, 01:29:59] Alex Regueiro: Oh nice. He studies at the Uni of Manchester?
[08/12/2022, 01:30:33] Alice Lafferty: My arm is twisted..
[08/12/2022, 01:31:16] Alice Lafferty: By the way I also resent the imposition of makeup when going out in the evening so I will not be doing that this time. So, I hope you are not embarrassed to be seen with me.
[08/12/2022, 01:31:45] Alex Regueiro: Hah, I was just typing to say I'd reach out to my dad and one friend, but... if you think it won't bother you too much, let's try!
[08/12/2022, 01:32:05] Alex Regueiro: No, of course not. That's totally down to you. It's not like we're dating now.
[08/12/2022, 01:32:30] Alice Lafferty: I think it would be a good idea to ask them provisionally if they are free.
[08/12/2022, 01:33:06] Alice Lafferty: Yes that but also just generally being in public at a semi-formal event.
[08/12/2022, 01:33:40] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. What I was going to say was that I'd put feelers out to them, and you let me know tomorrow evening whether you feel (relatively) up for it...?
[08/12/2022, 01:33:46] Alex Regueiro: And if not I have a backup
[08/12/2022, 01:34:10] Alice Lafferty: Ok, that sounds good.
[08/12/2022, 01:34:25] Alex Regueiro: If it doesn't bother you, it doesn't bother me. Honestly.
[08/12/2022, 01:34:27] Alice Lafferty: I do really apologise about the late notice. This is obviously the third occasion too.
[08/12/2022, 01:34:55] Alex Regueiro: It's okay, I realise it had just slipped your mind.
[08/12/2022, 01:35:11] Alex Regueiro: You're lucky I don't operate on a three-strikes principle though! üòâ
[08/12/2022, 01:35:35] Alice Lafferty: That would be completely reasonable! I don't know why people bother asking me anywhere!
[08/12/2022, 01:36:08] Alex Regueiro: I do kid
[08/12/2022, 01:36:21] Alex Regueiro: People must find you vaguely fun/interesting. Shock horror?
[08/12/2022, 01:37:09] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[08/12/2022, 01:37:15] Alice Lafferty: You've been very good about it
[08/12/2022, 01:37:30] Alex Regueiro: I should also say I felt a bit bad after inviting you to the salon and that not going ahead not...
[08/12/2022, 01:37:40] Alex Regueiro: now*
[08/12/2022, 01:37:45] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it will happen, just in early January.
[08/12/2022, 01:38:16] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, don't worry!
[08/12/2022, 01:38:27] Alice Lafferty: No christmas party?üò¢
[08/12/2022, 01:38:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, sorry.
[08/12/2022, 01:38:37] Alex Regueiro: No we're doing the Christmas party still
[08/12/2022, 01:38:57] Alice Lafferty: Is that for established members
[08/12/2022, 01:38:59] Alex Regueiro: Just people have that and a few other events (like office Christmas parties), and no one was super keen to host a salon that week, so we decided not to force it...
[08/12/2022, 01:39:11] Alice Lafferty: That makes sense.
[08/12/2022, 01:39:29] Alice Lafferty: Oh well, I'd still be glad to go whenever the first meeting of the new year is.
[08/12/2022, 01:39:58] Alex Regueiro: It's for... members. You could come if you liked! Especially because I'm organising it. I thought I mentioned it in passing no?
[08/12/2022, 01:40:16] Alex Regueiro: You're a prospective member, at least, right?
[08/12/2022, 01:40:33] Alice Lafferty: Oh I didn't know you were organising it?
[08/12/2022, 01:40:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Me and another woman who's a regular. Though I ended up doing almost all of it heh
[08/12/2022, 01:41:14] Alice Lafferty: Really keen not to force myself into any group unwelcome so
[08/12/2022, 01:41:21] Alice Lafferty: Is this the one on the 15th?
[08/12/2022, 01:41:28] Alice Lafferty: Haha how did you find that?
[08/12/2022, 01:41:51] Alex Regueiro: You would not be unwelcome. I mean, you'd be welcome! We're a friendly bunch.
[08/12/2022, 01:41:56] Alice Lafferty: Where did you decide to hold it?
[08/12/2022, 01:42:38] Alex Regueiro: A few people are bringing plus-ones anyway. But don't worry, I wouldn't dare cause us both the awkwardness of inviting you on that basis!
[08/12/2022, 01:42:51] Alex Regueiro: The Duke of Cambridge (gastropub) in Battersea
[08/12/2022, 01:43:15] Alice Lafferty: Haha ok
[08/12/2022, 01:43:48] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok, so you didn't have to go so far as to arrange catering and decorations and stuff
[08/12/2022, 01:44:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh no. It's more just dinner and drinks. Not a proper party or anything
[08/12/2022, 01:44:47] Alex Regueiro: end of year celebration, if you will
[08/12/2022, 01:45:00] Alice Lafferty: Phew
[08/12/2022, 01:45:30] Alice Lafferty: Well enjoy anyway!
[08/12/2022, 01:45:41] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. It was a pain enough organising that! And I'm not a big one for parties anyway
[08/12/2022, 01:45:50] Alex Regueiro: So you're not interested after all?
[08/12/2022, 01:46:15] Alex Regueiro: No pressure. Just don't want you to be needlessly bashful. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 01:46:25] Alex Regueiro: First salon next year works well too.
[08/12/2022, 01:46:26] Alice Lafferty: Well it sounds nice but I'm not sure on what basis I could come.
[08/12/2022, 01:46:34] Alice Lafferty: I don't understand the etiquette!!!!!
[08/12/2022, 01:47:15] Alex Regueiro: On the basis of being a friend of the guy who's organising it and me bending the (very much unwritten and informal) rules?
[08/12/2022, 01:47:53] Alice Lafferty: The bending the rules part is what I was worried about.
[08/12/2022, 01:47:58] Alice Lafferty: But if it's ok
[08/12/2022, 01:48:24] Alex Regueiro: Honestly, there are no real rules. We don't have a dusty old charter or anything. üòÄ
[08/12/2022, 01:48:44] Alex Regueiro: So please just decide on the basis of whether it's something that appeals to you. And I'll handle the rest.
[08/12/2022, 01:48:50] Alice Lafferty: Who knew I could make even attending a simple invitation so agonising.
[08/12/2022, 01:48:57] Alice Lafferty: *accepting
[08/12/2022, 01:49:03] Alex Regueiro: Haha you have a special talent, I'll give you that.
[08/12/2022, 01:49:25] Alex Regueiro: I'd present you as a "friend who's keen to come to future salons".
[08/12/2022, 01:49:34] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I would like to come. I guess I was worried the other members would be like 'who is this parvenu'
[08/12/2022, 01:49:45] Alice Lafferty: Or I would be a parvenuE I guess
[08/12/2022, 01:50:15] Alex Regueiro: Ha!
[08/12/2022, 01:50:52] Alex Regueiro: We'd really not care
[08/12/2022, 01:50:53] Alice Lafferty: 'Just shows up for the Christmas drinks'
[08/12/2022, 01:51:08] Alex Regueiro: A couple of people coming only showed up to one salon I think
[08/12/2022, 01:51:14] Alice Lafferty: I know! I'm sure nobody would care, I'm just being neurotic.
[08/12/2022, 01:51:16] Alex Regueiro: Well, and the plus-ones to none of them!
[08/12/2022, 01:52:32] Alex Regueiro: You're endearingly self-effacing about this all, and I'm sure that would work on anyone else. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 01:52:50] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I will say tentatively that I will come if you'll have me.
[08/12/2022, 01:53:06] Alex Regueiro: Or just start talking about the grammar of French loanwards into English and that will charm them
[08/12/2022, 01:53:10] Alex Regueiro: Indubitably
[08/12/2022, 01:53:18] Alice Lafferty: It very quickly crosses over into being annoying
[08/12/2022, 01:53:57] Alice Lafferty: Grammar of romance languages seemed to be more your area..
[08/12/2022, 01:54:48] Alice Lafferty: And I will let you know as soon as possible about Friday.
[08/12/2022, 01:54:51] Alex Regueiro: Okay. Let me make an enquiry and keep you posted? I'd need to get your pre-order for food soon, but let's see.
[08/12/2022, 01:55:00] Alice Lafferty: I'll see if I can get my parents to leave a bit later.
[08/12/2022, 01:56:05] Alice Lafferty: Oh no I didn't foresee there being an actual sit-down meal. This is all going to spiral hugely.
[08/12/2022, 01:56:21] Alex Regueiro: Okay thanks. But please don't feel too much pressure. I don't want to be inconsiderate. Still, if there's any chance it might not completely sap your energy, and you're willing to make an exception for this rare occasion and a top-rate concert, then do join me. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 01:56:24] Alice Lafferty: You must have already put in the no. of places etc?
[08/12/2022, 01:56:30] Alex Regueiro: I have, but it can be changed
[08/12/2022, 01:56:33] Alice Lafferty: *heads I mean
[08/12/2022, 01:56:35] Alex Regueiro: haha
[08/12/2022, 01:57:24] Alice Lafferty: üôÅ I don't have to eat with you or anything, I could just show up to meet people briefly.
[08/12/2022, 01:57:40] Alex Regueiro: Changed again, I should say! We've already changed it twice heh
[08/12/2022, 01:57:41] Alice Lafferty: That will be such a pain and the pub will begrudge you
[08/12/2022, 01:57:55] Alex Regueiro: Maybe... but it's extra dosh for them right?
[08/12/2022, 01:58:03] Alex Regueiro: Well, that works too
[08/12/2022, 01:58:36] Alex Regueiro: If you don't mind trudging down to Battersea just for drinks and a bit of mingling, that is.
[08/12/2022, 01:58:52] Alice Lafferty: Are people pre-paying?
[08/12/2022, 01:59:19] Alex Regueiro: Just a ¬£10 deposit per person. I'm covering that because I'm apparently incredibly trusting/naive.
[08/12/2022, 01:59:45] Alex Regueiro: (Or I'd just make sure they were exiled from the salon if they cancelled and didn't pay the deposit still!)
[08/12/2022, 01:59:59] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to put this into a journey planner, first of all.
[08/12/2022, 02:00:08] Alice Lafferty: It should be ok, I can just hang around like the interloper I am
[08/12/2022, 02:00:14] Alice Lafferty: Oh no
[08/12/2022, 02:00:16] Alex Regueiro: Bonne id√©e.
[08/12/2022, 02:01:13] Alex Regueiro: Okay, shall we just say, you'll come down for post-dinner drinks and chat? I can see you're a bit nervous about the whole situation, so I don't want that to prey on your mind!
[08/12/2022, 02:01:16] Alice Lafferty: You should have absolutely extracted the deposit from people, unless it's an extremely high trust close knit group.
[08/12/2022, 02:01:27] Alex Regueiro: And if you cancel last minute, there's truly no loss.
[08/12/2022, 02:01:45] Alex Regueiro: I know I should have, but a) I'm lazy, b) it's fairly close-knit. Some of them are genuine friends.
[08/12/2022, 02:01:50] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[08/12/2022, 02:01:58] Alice Lafferty: Exactly
[08/12/2022, 02:02:23] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I'm not trying to disinvite you to the dinner part now. Just thinking it all over, this would probably be much more comfortable for you!
[08/12/2022, 02:02:42] Alice Lafferty: It's good that you know me well enough to cover your losses this wayüëç
[08/12/2022, 02:03:01] Alice Lafferty: Ok, maybe I'm just cynical.
[08/12/2022, 02:03:07] Alice Lafferty: How many are you expecting?
[08/12/2022, 02:03:29] Alice Lafferty: I completely agree - that's why I said 'ok'.
[08/12/2022, 02:03:30] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Contingency plans both for Friday and for the 17th...
[08/12/2022, 02:03:51] Alex Regueiro: Obviously I hope you can make both, but I'm hardly out in the cold if you can't. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 02:04:00] Alex Regueiro: ü´°
[08/12/2022, 02:04:07] Alex Regueiro: Excellent
[08/12/2022, 02:06:42] Alex Regueiro: BTW I meant to say: my sis went to Manchester uni too. She loved it. I think the last time I was there was her graduation ceremony.
[08/12/2022, 02:07:04] Alex Regueiro: Hope your brother's enjoying it too.
[08/12/2022, 02:07:22] Alice Lafferty: Haha nice
[08/12/2022, 02:07:49] Alice Lafferty: He is, I think. He's really thrown himself into the nightlife opportunities as far as we can tell.
[08/12/2022, 02:08:03] Alex Regueiro: Hah I was just going to say... great nightlife
[08/12/2022, 02:08:17] Alice Lafferty: What did your sister study?
[08/12/2022, 02:08:17] Alex Regueiro: My sister is a "normie" too, so she thrived in that environment
[08/12/2022, 02:08:32] Alex Regueiro: Business and language (Spanish)
[08/12/2022, 02:09:09] Alice Lafferty: I'm afraid of using that term because I can't say it without sounding like a huge wanker
[08/12/2022, 02:09:15] Alice Lafferty: But yes so is my brother.
[08/12/2022, 02:09:17] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[08/12/2022, 02:09:27] Alex Regueiro: Yes I was half imitating you...
[08/12/2022, 02:09:34] Alex Regueiro: And it's all about tone/context I think
[08/12/2022, 02:09:48] Alex Regueiro: You used it semi-ironically, which is perfect I reckon
[08/12/2022, 02:10:21] Alex Regueiro: People who use it derogatively or pretentiously are the wankers
[08/12/2022, 02:10:38] Alice Lafferty: It's not even derogatory when I use it towards him. He's doing Chemistry, is really extroverted and has set himself up really well, basically.
[08/12/2022, 02:10:48] Alice Lafferty: Wait did I actually use it?
[08/12/2022, 02:10:51] Alex Regueiro: That's super
[08/12/2022, 02:11:01] Alex Regueiro: Yes! In relation to him as well hah
[08/12/2022, 02:11:17] Alex Regueiro: Our last convo I think? Or the one before
[08/12/2022, 02:11:36] Alice Lafferty: He by far has the brightest future out of my siblings.
[08/12/2022, 02:11:46] Alice Lafferty: Gosh, what am I coming to...
[08/12/2022, 02:11:58] Alice Lafferty: I don't even remember.
[08/12/2022, 02:12:08] Alex Regueiro: Tessa (my sister) is such an extrovert too. Not a complete wild thing by the standard of undergraduates, but she enjoyed a good night out at the club... among other things.
[08/12/2022, 02:12:17] Alex Regueiro: She's a DJ on the side now
[08/12/2022, 02:12:45] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, sounds familiar
[08/12/2022, 02:12:50] Alex Regueiro: I'll put it down to you being caught in some strange circadian no-man's land then. Sound fair?
[08/12/2022, 02:12:55] Alice Lafferty: That's actually really cool
[08/12/2022, 02:13:08] Alex Regueiro: Out of the two, that is?
[08/12/2022, 02:13:15] Alice Lafferty: That is generous of you yeah
[08/12/2022, 02:13:21] Alice Lafferty: Out of the three of us.
[08/12/2022, 02:13:48] Alice Lafferty: My youngest brother is literally me if I was male.
[08/12/2022, 02:13:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm really happy for her. She's having more and more success too, though I don't think she'll ever do it professionally. It's not really my sort of music, to be fair, but she has some talent...
[08/12/2022, 02:14:15] Alex Regueiro: Haha that's kind of cool though, you have a sibling you can really resonate with
[08/12/2022, 02:14:16] Alice Lafferty: Like electronic or drum and bass music I guess?
[08/12/2022, 02:14:31] Alex Regueiro: I get on very well with my sister, all things considered, but she's pretty darn different...
[08/12/2022, 02:14:59] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. Don't write yourself off! But it's true, the world is made for "normies". And there's nothing necessarily wrong with that.
[08/12/2022, 02:15:13] Alice Lafferty: It's not a bad thing. Can take good cues on how to live from extroverted people.
[08/12/2022, 02:15:14] Alex Regueiro: Drum and bass is a big component yeah. And some modern Latino music.
[08/12/2022, 02:15:25] Alex Regueiro: And a bit of jungle/garage influence I think?
[08/12/2022, 02:15:41] Alice Lafferty: Haha I agree with all of this.
[08/12/2022, 02:15:54] Alice Lafferty: It's just majority rule
[08/12/2022, 02:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Yep, it's definitely something to learn. Or it can just interesting in a people-watching way. But I learnt to stop forcing myself to act like an extrovert years ago... hopefully you're not making the same mistake. I don't think so?
[08/12/2022, 02:16:55] Alice Lafferty: Nice. Also not what I'm naturally drawn to but I can appreciate it from a point of removal.
[08/12/2022, 02:16:57] Alex Regueiro: Right. We can't earnestly support democracy if we don't say this, can we?
[08/12/2022, 02:17:11] Alex Regueiro: Exactly the same for me
[08/12/2022, 02:17:52] Alice Lafferty: It would probably be good for both of us to be in relationships with """normies""".
[08/12/2022, 02:18:05] Alice Lafferty: This is something I've been thinking about.
[08/12/2022, 02:18:08] Alex Regueiro: You know, I've thought that on many occasions...
[08/12/2022, 02:18:35] Alex Regueiro: But something in me is drawn to the... outliers. üòï
[08/12/2022, 02:19:02] Alice Lafferty: For me at least. It would help me feel more grounded in the world and less alienated I think.
[08/12/2022, 02:19:04] Alex Regueiro: I just find them so much more interesting and fun. And more compatible at least in certain ways
[08/12/2022, 02:19:22] Alice Lafferty: This is all quite far in the future too, of course.
[08/12/2022, 02:19:53] Alex Regueiro: Aha, so now the truth about your decision is coming out...
[08/12/2022, 02:19:54] Alice Lafferty: Me too! But might have to push past that
[08/12/2022, 02:20:01] Alex Regueiro: That totally makes sense though
[08/12/2022, 02:20:17] Alice Lafferty: What do you mean?
[08/12/2022, 02:20:25] Alex Regueiro: I'm just teasing you
[08/12/2022, 02:20:43] Alex Regueiro: About not being read / in the right place to be seeing someone.
[08/12/2022, 02:20:47] Alex Regueiro: Don't worry, it was very much a joke!
[08/12/2022, 02:21:01] Alice Lafferty: Oh no please believe me what I told you. Because it's true.
[08/12/2022, 02:21:22] Alice Lafferty: This is really just theoretical future relationships I thinking of.
[08/12/2022, 02:21:43] Alice Lafferty: Which I will likely never have the wits or courage to actually enter!
[08/12/2022, 02:21:58] Alice Lafferty: This is another one of our more meta conversations.
[08/12/2022, 02:22:12] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok!
[08/12/2022, 02:22:48] Alex Regueiro: It's difficult, in my experience. But not impossible. The thing for me is... I can do a very passable impression of a "normie", at least in public. But friends or partners that are too close to the norm are just a bit dull in the long run, as I see it.
[08/12/2022, 02:23:12] Alex Regueiro: So I wish you luck if you do go down that route!
[08/12/2022, 02:23:40] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure you will in time. You'll gain a bit of confidence with age and experience.
[08/12/2022, 02:24:14] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I am just looking for a phone charger
[08/12/2022, 02:24:16] Alex Regueiro: I know. You were refreshingly forthright and honest. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 02:25:04] Alice Lafferty: I see. Maybe you don't suffer so much with feeling kind of 'untethered' from the world?
[08/12/2022, 02:25:18] Alex Regueiro: No, I don't.
[08/12/2022, 02:25:19] Alice Lafferty: Plus it seems like you have more robust friendship groups etc, which is really good.
[08/12/2022, 02:25:30] Alex Regueiro: I may have at some point. My memory is failing in old age now!
[08/12/2022, 02:25:47] Alice Lafferty: Haha, maybe it is just an age thing.
[08/12/2022, 02:25:49] Alex Regueiro: I feel like I'm very far from the norm in some respects and traits
[08/12/2022, 02:26:05] Alex Regueiro: But I don't feel untethered, exactly
[08/12/2022, 02:26:22] Alex Regueiro: I suppose I'm at peace with my nature now, and my place in the world. To a large extent.
[08/12/2022, 02:27:12] Alex Regueiro: Having good people around me is really helpful in that regard, I'd say. Friends and family.
[08/12/2022, 02:27:26] Alice Lafferty: That is really good.
[08/12/2022, 02:27:56] Alex Regueiro: As well as doing a lot of introspection over the years. (The issue used to be doing too much!)
[08/12/2022, 02:28:07] Alice Lafferty: You probably have had more time to scope things out and so have a clearer idea of what you want to - ie, not a ""normie"".
[08/12/2022, 02:28:23] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I will come to all these realisations too in my own time... but anyway.
[08/12/2022, 02:28:26] Alex Regueiro: Maybe you'll have a sort of quarter-life crisis like me, and come out the other side of it feeling more grounded and at peace with yourself. üòÄ
[08/12/2022, 02:29:01] Alex Regueiro: Right. Most of it's just a matter of time. Learning the ropes of life.
[08/12/2022, 02:29:04] Alice Lafferty: I've kind of heard about this. Was that around 25 for you?
[08/12/2022, 02:29:53] Alex Regueiro: I already know you have a great attitude towards self-reflection/improvement, and are pretty pragmatic, so it's surely just a matter of time for you.
[08/12/2022, 02:30:12] Alex Regueiro: Yep, very much so. Within a year or two. It dragged on I suppose...
[08/12/2022, 02:30:14] Alice Lafferty: Ah hopefully.
[08/12/2022, 02:31:00] Alice Lafferty: Was this when you were debating doing a phd?
[08/12/2022, 02:31:01] Alex Regueiro: Mini crises will still happen though. Even normal folks get them. Part of life. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 02:31:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, and after my start-up fizzled out... And after a messy long-distance relationship...
[08/12/2022, 02:31:49] Alex Regueiro: All within a year or two of each other
[08/12/2022, 02:32:07] Alice Lafferty: Right... that would definitely be enough to trigger it.
[08/12/2022, 02:33:30] Alex Regueiro: So, do you have a sort of plan of action to "tether" yourself? Over the next year or so?
[08/12/2022, 02:34:27] Alice Lafferty: I'm glad you got over it anyhow
[08/12/2022, 02:34:33] Alice Lafferty: Not a concrete one!
[08/12/2022, 02:35:33] Alice Lafferty: I'm actually currently attempting to change degree course at Cambridge.
[08/12/2022, 02:36:01] Alice Lafferty: But they're pretty reluctant to let people do that so it's kind of a long shot.
[08/12/2022, 02:36:05] Alex Regueiro: Thanks. Life and finding fulfilment is an ongoing process. You regularly need to steer the boat back on course, I find, but you can become a good sailor at least!
[08/12/2022, 02:36:29] Alex Regueiro: I meant to suggest that at one point actually. What to?
[08/12/2022, 02:49:57] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to bed now, and I'm guessing your phone finally died anyway... to be continued!
[08/12/2022, 02:50:17] Alex Regueiro: Bonne nuit
[08/12/2022, 02:50:55] Alex Regueiro: (Funny, that didn't even send I think)
[08/12/2022, 21:12:46] Alice Lafferty: Pol sci or maybe if I push it Nat Sci.
[08/12/2022, 21:14:01] Alice Lafferty: I have the right A-levels (maths & chem) but that was nearly three years ago now. And obviously they'd be extremely suspicious of me changing from an arts to a science degree.
[08/12/2022, 21:14:09] Alex Regueiro: Ah cool
[08/12/2022, 21:14:36] Alex Regueiro: I reckon you'd be capable of either
[08/12/2022, 21:14:42] Alice Lafferty: Plus I still may encounter the same issues with actually attending supervisions and lectures.
[08/12/2022, 21:14:53] Alice Lafferty: So it may just be OU.
[08/12/2022, 21:15:03] Alice Lafferty: Anyway.
[08/12/2022, 21:15:09] Alex Regueiro: Political science might be easier to justify yes... but chemistry could become a family affair. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 21:15:13] Alice Lafferty: I think we had the first proper frost today?
[08/12/2022, 21:15:19] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it seems like it
[08/12/2022, 21:15:45] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's pot luck as to whether they coincide with your body's daytime eh?
[08/12/2022, 21:15:53] Alice Lafferty: I'm serious grass crunching right now.
[08/12/2022, 21:16:56] Alice Lafferty: Right. I didn't mean to offload all of this stuff on to you. I've actually found their pastoral support ok despite what the lamestream media says
[08/12/2022, 21:17:00] Alex Regueiro: I've actually never heard that term hah.
[08/12/2022, 21:17:06] Alex Regueiro: Does it mean ruminating over it or something?
[08/12/2022, 21:17:30] Alice Lafferty: No, the grass is crunchy because of the frost!
[08/12/2022, 21:17:40] Alice Lafferty: It's totally literal
[08/12/2022, 21:18:45] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Even back when I was at Imperial it was pretty good. And I needed it then because I really screwed up an exam. I was in a real state over exam season, partly because of a family death, partly other things.
[08/12/2022, 21:19:17] Alex Regueiro: They were very decent with me. I get the feeling the general culture of entitlement and victimisation means whatever unis do these days, it's never enough.
[08/12/2022, 21:19:44] Alex Regueiro: Oh haha. My mind is stuck in metaphor mode. Walking the dog or something?
[08/12/2022, 21:20:10] Alice Lafferty: Yes they get kind of a bad rap.
[08/12/2022, 21:20:26] Alice Lafferty: Like a final exam?
[08/12/2022, 21:21:00] Alice Lafferty: I'm just walking by myself. I love winter so much.
[08/12/2022, 21:21:19] Alex Regueiro: Like there were protests over this guy killing himself at Bristol the year before I came. But the university did reach out to him to offer him psychological support and whatnot. It was tragic, but you can't just scapegoat the university.
[08/12/2022, 21:21:57] Alice Lafferty: Bristol had a string of those right?
[08/12/2022, 21:22:30] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I really get that. Used to go for winter strolls by myself all the time. In or along the edge of the woods. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 21:22:32] Alice Lafferty: There were I think 5 suicides at Cambridge just in my first year.
[08/12/2022, 21:22:49] Alice Lafferty: I do not blame the University.
[08/12/2022, 21:22:56] Alice Lafferty: But...
[08/12/2022, 21:22:59] Alex Regueiro: I think so. A real spate of them in recent years.
[08/12/2022, 21:23:04] Alex Regueiro: Yikes
[08/12/2022, 21:24:09] Alice Lafferty: I think I only knew one guy who was in the year above me and doing History.
[08/12/2022, 21:24:47] Alice Lafferty: He was extremely isolated, I believe.
[08/12/2022, 21:25:35] Alice Lafferty: We shared a director of studies, who said he literally did everything he could to coax him out of his shell, and I believe him.
[08/12/2022, 21:26:00] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. It's usually because of long-standing mental health issues, I get the feeling
[08/12/2022, 21:26:06] Alex Regueiro: and extreme isolation like you say
[08/12/2022, 21:26:16] Alex Regueiro: Even with help from the family, sadly only so much can be done sometimes...
[08/12/2022, 21:26:20] Alex Regueiro: Did you know him well?
[08/12/2022, 21:26:21] Alice Lafferty: Right. Often when deeply unhappy you resist any help offered to you anyway.
[08/12/2022, 21:26:37] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I've been through that. Thankfully only short periods though.
[08/12/2022, 21:26:52] Alice Lafferty: No not all. He was also at Homerton so just saw him around.
[08/12/2022, 21:26:58] Alex Regueiro: oh fair
[08/12/2022, 21:28:30] Alex Regueiro: My Instagram feed from a few years back is like half pics from my winter walks! Not that I ever took many.
[08/12/2022, 21:29:18] Alice Lafferty: Oh what's your instagram?
[08/12/2022, 21:29:33] Alice Lafferty: So I can see...
[08/12/2022, 21:31:00] Alice Lafferty: Or you don't have to say if you don't want to btw
[08/12/2022, 21:31:11] Alex Regueiro: https://www.instagram.com/alexreg/
[08/12/2022, 21:31:20] Alex Regueiro: No, it's more than fine. There you go!
[08/12/2022, 21:31:23] Alice Lafferty: I don't personally use it myself but I sometimes stalk other people's accountsüëç
[08/12/2022, 21:32:25] Alex Regueiro: My online footprint is pretty large anyway. You could find it very easily I imagine. üòÄ
[08/12/2022, 21:32:39] Alex Regueiro: Nothing wrong with a bit of a benign cyberstalking...
[08/12/2022, 21:32:42] Alice Lafferty: I'm looking right now
[08/12/2022, 21:33:38] Alice Lafferty: Your account is very tasteful and well-curated.
[08/12/2022, 21:34:09] Alex Regueiro: I think you have to go back quite a bit to find the winter walk pics. I just looked now. Some of them must have been on Facebook too.
[08/12/2022, 21:34:39] Alex Regueiro: I'm a bit ashamed of the dinner plate phase I went through now. üò¨
[08/12/2022, 21:34:46] Alice Lafferty: Haha the earliest picture is a 2012 'ZOMG' snow picture
[08/12/2022, 21:34:46] Alex Regueiro: But at least there aren't many selfies.
[08/12/2022, 21:34:57] Alex Regueiro: That's kind of you to say. Thanks
[08/12/2022, 21:35:11] Alex Regueiro: I'm an infrequent enough poster I can afford to be picky at least!
[08/12/2022, 21:35:22] Alice Lafferty: Were most of the pictures taken on an iPhone or?
[08/12/2022, 21:35:43] Alex Regueiro: HAha yes!
[08/12/2022, 21:35:56] Alice Lafferty: Makes it seem worth getting a new phone just for the camera. Mine is crap
[08/12/2022, 21:36:05] Alex Regueiro: That sort of lingo is so cringe to me now. I think it was mainly ironic even then though...
[08/12/2022, 21:36:49] Alex Regueiro: Yep. You could probably do an analysis and figure out exactly when I upgraded my iPhone over the years, based on my Instagram!
[08/12/2022, 21:37:05] Alice Lafferty: It's fine! Nobody can escape the charge of using cringy internet slang
[08/12/2022, 21:37:45] Alice Lafferty: I got an instagram account when I was just 11. So 2013. Very very bad.
[08/12/2022, 21:37:57] Alice Lafferty: It may be going the way of Facebook anyway.
[08/12/2022, 21:38:04] Alex Regueiro: Uff you Zoomer you
[08/12/2022, 21:38:43] Alex Regueiro: I liked how we discussed on our first date how we'd keep our hypothetical kids well away from smartphones, computers, and social media until a good age!
[08/12/2022, 21:39:19] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I feel really strongly about that
[08/12/2022, 21:39:22] Alex Regueiro: It might well be. I mean, it's all Meta now after all. I do think Instagram is possibly the least pernicious of all the social media platforms if used moderately though.
[08/12/2022, 21:39:33] Alex Regueiro: i.e. stay clear of the influencers and other vapid nonsense
[08/12/2022, 21:39:44] Alex Regueiro: And DEFINITELY don't try to be an influencer yourself
[08/12/2022, 21:40:09] Alice Lafferty: Interesting... it doesn't feel that way to me. Facebook seems/seemed the most wholesome.
[08/12/2022, 21:40:11] Alex Regueiro: Same. Partly through mulling over the ramifications every so often, and partly from knowing how it adversely affected me.
[08/12/2022, 21:40:33] Alice Lafferty: That's what I mean, there weren't really 'Facebook influencers' were there?
[08/12/2022, 21:40:41] Alice Lafferty: Did you ever have a MySpace?
[08/12/2022, 21:41:05] Alex Regueiro: I mean, maybe I'm focusing more on the chat side of things. It's just really hard to get into a bad argument and receive or spew vitriol on Instagram... at least compared to Facebook, let alone Twitter!
[08/12/2022, 21:41:24] Alex Regueiro: Yeah true. Though with Stories and everything on Facebook now, it's converged a little...
[08/12/2022, 21:41:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes true Instagram has practically no political content.
[08/12/2022, 21:42:08] Alice Lafferty: I've had by far the worst experience on Twitter yes.
[08/12/2022, 21:42:35] Alex Regueiro: I'm actually torn. Facebook is better in some ways, Instagram in others. Instagram has the potential to be really nasty for self-esteem, presenting fake curated perfect lives, and whatnot... but I find it fairly easy to avoid that.
[08/12/2022, 21:42:57] Alex Regueiro: Facebook is mainly fine, but with all the ads these days. The groups there are both a blessing and curse.
[08/12/2022, 21:43:01] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[08/12/2022, 21:43:06] Alex Regueiro: So your Insta account is long gone right?
[08/12/2022, 21:43:15] Alice Lafferty: All of this depends on how it used too, of course.
[08/12/2022, 21:43:32] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I haven't used it since maybe 2018.
[08/12/2022, 21:43:41] Alex Regueiro: No. I maybe looked at it at one point, but didn't really bother. Most of my schoolmates had one at some point.  I did use MSN Messenger back when it was all the rage though ha!
[08/12/2022, 21:44:49] Alice Lafferty: Instagram has these terrifying ads embedded into your feed which don't declare themselves as ads. And it's own whole shopping section too I believe.
[08/12/2022, 21:44:54] Alex Regueiro: Even though I got into computers and technology reeeasonably early, it was more through being a nerd and just finding things like programming little games and making shitty websites fun. Or messing around with electronics. I didn't grow up with social media. Got my Facebook account when I was 17 I think (2007)
[08/12/2022, 21:45:26] Alice Lafferty: Yes I've heard about that!
[08/12/2022, 21:45:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah they're pretty annoying, but they're still not as bad as FB ads. Which are much more likely to be political or provocative in nature.
[08/12/2022, 21:45:37] Alice Lafferty: This is the way to go.
[08/12/2022, 21:45:48] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and FB enables doomscrolling, like Twitter. üò©
[08/12/2022, 21:46:09] Alice Lafferty: I wish I had experienced web 1.0
[08/12/2022, 21:46:27] Alice Lafferty: It sounds great to be computer literate yet not brain damaged from social media.
[08/12/2022, 21:46:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'd like to think. I was the sort of kid who had fun with electronic kits, chemistry sets, and bottle rockets. ü§ì
[08/12/2022, 21:46:39] Alice Lafferty: True!
[08/12/2022, 21:46:40] Alex Regueiro: I don't think it ruined me though.
[08/12/2022, 21:47:07] Alice Lafferty: These are acceptable forms of childhood tech use.
[08/12/2022, 21:48:35] Alex Regueiro: It does. I won't pretend I'm 100% that, but thankfully having an interest in the "intellectual" or nerdy side of technology (plus being old enough to have my early childhood internet/phone/computer-free) is something I'm really grateful for. Rather than just growing up a slave to it as so many kids do unwitting these days. It's not even their fault. More just a fact of our current society, or their parents' fault indeed.
[08/12/2022, 21:48:59] Alex Regueiro: Oh so it still exists üëÄ
[08/12/2022, 21:50:39] Alice Lafferty: Golden age
[08/12/2022, 21:52:35] Alice Lafferty: I'm just looking for an article I read about this to send to you
[08/12/2022, 21:53:02] Alex Regueiro: Oh right, sounds good
[08/12/2022, 21:57:31] Alex Regueiro: Yep, though maybe that was really our parents generation and earlier... you know, when kids would frolic outside and all, playing games on the streets and exploring.
[08/12/2022, 21:59:33] Alex Regueiro: I have a very weird relationship with technology. Intellectually, for the most part. But nor was I particularly "geeky" in the sense it was an obsession for its own sake. And I got strongly influenced by Tolkien's views on nature and industrialisation in the end.
[08/12/2022, 22:01:02] Alice Lafferty: Ok I cannot find it. I don't have a good bookmarking system.
[08/12/2022, 22:01:43] Alex Regueiro: No worries. Just send me the link if you ever stumble across it again.
[08/12/2022, 22:01:46] Alice Lafferty: No it's deleted! Plus I barely posted on it because I was cowed by the much more interesting and beautiful people
[08/12/2022, 22:02:17] Alex Regueiro: I usually just search my browser history. My to-read list is either open tabs or I use Pocket, which is quite a handy app
[08/12/2022, 22:02:35] Alice Lafferty: Interesting.
[08/12/2022, 22:02:46] Alex Regueiro: Ahh no, you got sucked into the trap of the carefully curated windows into the lives of the Beautiful People (tm)
[08/12/2022, 22:03:00] Alice Lafferty: My safari browser history only saves the last ~month I think.
[08/12/2022, 22:03:32] Alice Lafferty: Retvrn to the shires
[08/12/2022, 22:03:33] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes. That setting can be changed though, if you fancy
[08/12/2022, 22:03:50] Alex Regueiro: That's right. Down with Saruman and his wheels of industry!
[08/12/2022, 22:03:55] Alice Lafferty: Yes I will I think.
[08/12/2022, 22:04:38] Alice Lafferty: Ehh, I always try to guard my senses from enchanting bucolic pre-industrial scenes.
[08/12/2022, 22:05:17] Alex Regueiro: Yes. Pre-industrial countryside life must have been really awful in certain ways
[08/12/2022, 22:05:21] Alex Regueiro: But damn pretty scenery!
[08/12/2022, 22:05:53] Alice Lafferty: Because I'm easily seduced by them. But the more time I spend among neo-trads the less I am convinced by them.
[08/12/2022, 22:06:13] Alex Regueiro: I do now think industrialisation has been a positive force on the whole, contrary to Tolkien. But it always needs to be restrained and mitigated.
[08/12/2022, 22:06:25] Alex Regueiro: Or it has a tendency to eat up everything that is good and pure.
[08/12/2022, 22:06:33] Alice Lafferty: Right, we literally have no idea.
[08/12/2022, 22:07:02] Alex Regueiro: I have some idea at an intellectual level, but no, I certainly can't put myself in my ancestors' shoes, properly
[08/12/2022, 22:07:39] Alice Lafferty: Also depends how far back you're talking.
[08/12/2022, 22:08:18] Alice Lafferty: But some expected features are immense amounts of manual labour and constant proximity to death.
[08/12/2022, 22:08:20] Alex Regueiro: Like, I think certain urban environments (and above all a lot of post-War architecture) is a blight on our society and lives. But urban environments can always be lovely if done right. Arguably this country needs both more hard industry and more protection for countryside land.
[08/12/2022, 22:08:27] Alex Regueiro: And the countryside way of life to some extent
[08/12/2022, 22:08:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah...
[08/12/2022, 22:09:18] Alice Lafferty: Isn' the 'countryside way of life' a false rural idyll propped up by wealth generated in cities.
[08/12/2022, 22:09:36] Alice Lafferty: Like City workers with second homes in the cotswolds.
[08/12/2022, 22:09:54] Alex Regueiro: Yes in part hah
[08/12/2022, 22:10:00] Alex Regueiro: I don't think it need be generated in the cities
[08/12/2022, 22:10:14] Alice Lafferty: I probably sound like a broken record on this.
[08/12/2022, 22:10:31] Alex Regueiro: Even in the past, there were gentleman farmers and whatnot who quite a pleasurable and peaceful life by the standard of the times
[08/12/2022, 22:10:41] Alex Regueiro: Free from tribulations I daresay
[08/12/2022, 22:10:42] Alice Lafferty: I'm swinging back around to tech optimsm and you are unwilling witness to this process.
[08/12/2022, 22:11:33] Alex Regueiro: Me personally?
[08/12/2022, 22:11:35] Alice Lafferty: ?? because they poor employed farm hands to do all the work?
[08/12/2022, 22:11:45] Alice Lafferty: Yes!
[08/12/2022, 22:11:52] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean "witness"?
[08/12/2022, 22:12:22] Alex Regueiro: In part. Some of them would engage in manual labour too, to a limited extent.
[08/12/2022, 22:13:05] Alex Regueiro: I do think there's a point to be made regardless: that being around nature and trees is genuinely good for the "soul". Or the mood and our psychological balance, to put it in more modern terms.
[08/12/2022, 22:13:44] Alex Regueiro: And old villages are on the whole much more (objectively) aesthetically pleasing than modern urban monstrosities.
[08/12/2022, 22:15:06] Alice Lafferty: I agree, this the heart of the problem for me. This stuff is genuinely enchanting.
[08/12/2022, 22:15:27] Alice Lafferty: I mean I just witter to you and you politely listen.
[08/12/2022, 22:15:46] Alice Lafferty: And can be pressed into service to justify almost anything.
[08/12/2022, 22:16:37] Alex Regueiro: As long as we can preserve 'enough' of that in our country, I don't mind a focus on urban environments to some extent. Though I do think megacities have an alienating and depersonalising effect on the human psyche that is hard to avoid, fundamentally because it's a very unnatural way of life for people.
[08/12/2022, 22:16:55] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. We agree on that at least
[08/12/2022, 22:17:02] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. But no, it's all good...
[08/12/2022, 22:17:39] Alice Lafferty: I think I fundamentally disagree that there is such a thing as 'the natural'.
[08/12/2022, 22:17:55] Alice Lafferty: Or thar some states of humanity could be 'purer' than others.
[08/12/2022, 22:17:58] Alex Regueiro: I do find it interesting. Even opposing views that challenge mine
[08/12/2022, 22:18:05] Alex Regueiro: Oh I'm not arguing for that
[08/12/2022, 22:18:09] Alex Regueiro: I mean natural in a more literal sense
[08/12/2022, 22:18:21] Alex Regueiro: Less human shaping of the environment
[08/12/2022, 22:18:36] Alice Lafferty: There's nothing natural about agriculture based villages.
[08/12/2022, 22:18:39] Alex Regueiro: Our creations and ways of life more in touch and compatible with the surrounding ecosystems
[08/12/2022, 22:18:59] Alex Regueiro: It's still a lot closer to nature than a city centre!
[08/12/2022, 22:19:04] Alex Regueiro: In a very precise way
[08/12/2022, 22:19:11] Alice Lafferty: Haha you sound like a permaculturist.
[08/12/2022, 22:19:15] Alex Regueiro: Or god forbid, suburbia. Even worse.
[08/12/2022, 22:19:30] Alex Regueiro: (Says the man who's grown up in the suburbs most of his life.)
[08/12/2022, 22:19:47] Alex Regueiro: I am sympathetic to some of its aims! Even if it's too idealistic in other respects.
[08/12/2022, 22:20:12] Alice Lafferty: But taming non-human ecosystems into wheat fields and building thatched cottages is still extremely 'unnatural'.
[08/12/2022, 22:20:17] Alice Lafferty: Even though beautiful.
[08/12/2022, 22:20:24] Alice Lafferty: Same
[08/12/2022, 22:20:40] Alice Lafferty: Yes that's why I've come to reject it too.
[08/12/2022, 22:21:17] Alex Regueiro: Right. Though even you concede it's far prettier than your average urban environment (arguably than any). Most people who have grown up even in the 21st century, in the city or countryside, would agree on this point
[08/12/2022, 22:21:24] Alex Regueiro: So it's essentially objective. Or intersubjective.
[08/12/2022, 22:21:46] Alice Lafferty: Yes it's pretty.
[08/12/2022, 22:22:02] Alex Regueiro: You're right to point out that humans practising farmers have heavily manipulated their environment. But at least you're still surrounded by natural things!
[08/12/2022, 22:22:07] Alice Lafferty: But I'm talking about your use of the word 'unnatural'.
[08/12/2022, 22:22:07] Alex Regueiro: So in that sense it's more natural.

[08/12/2022, 22:22:51] Alice Lafferty: My thumb literally slipped like three times and it cast up that ugly rainbow unicorn
[08/12/2022, 22:22:57] Alice Lafferty: I'm so sorry
[08/12/2022, 22:22:58] Alex Regueiro: And I have no idea how yo udid it
[08/12/2022, 22:23:01] Alex Regueiro: aha
[08/12/2022, 22:23:12] Alex Regueiro: It's all good
[08/12/2022, 22:23:13] Alice Lafferty: 'Sticker' right next to text box
[08/12/2022, 22:23:21] Alice Lafferty: I think?
[08/12/2022, 22:23:43] Alice Lafferty: It's literally not surrounded by natural things, at all.
[08/12/2022, 22:23:56] Alex Regueiro: As long as it's not one of those unicorns that are emblems for trannies and non-binary types...
[08/12/2022, 22:23:59] Alice Lafferty: Human activity has utterly changed the face of Britain (at least)
[08/12/2022, 22:24:18] Alice Lafferty: Nothing we see is 'natural' or would exist without human intervention.
[08/12/2022, 22:24:37] Alice Lafferty: Unless maybe you go into truly under populated areas.
[08/12/2022, 22:24:41] Alice Lafferty: So nowhere in England.
[08/12/2022, 22:24:50] Alice Lafferty: Maybe some parts of Scotland or Wales or whatever.
[08/12/2022, 22:24:59] Alex Regueiro: But it is. Like I said, you are surrounded by a whole range of trees, plants, animals. The ground is soil or dirt. In a city it's pavement, and the closest you can get to flora and fauna is a park and people walking their dogs!
[08/12/2022, 22:25:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes - those specific plants exist because they were introduced/planted/relocated by humans!
[08/12/2022, 22:25:57] Alice Lafferty: 'Hedgerows' are very biodiverse but not natural at all!
[08/12/2022, 22:26:01] Alex Regueiro: You need to realise there are different aspects to "natural". First, its a spectrum (or multiple spectrums). Second, I don't mean a "state of nature" or anything like that, but rather proximity to natural entities.
[08/12/2022, 22:26:10] Alice Lafferty: That is what I'm saying.
[08/12/2022, 22:26:22] Alice Lafferty: There's no such thing as 'natural' that can be clearly defined.
[08/12/2022, 22:26:45] Alex Regueiro: That's not true at all in many cases. Sure, the crops are, and hedgerows to some extent. But many are endemic to the place, and not cultivated or artificially produced at all.
[08/12/2022, 22:26:57] Alex Regueiro: Just by virtue of things not having been hacked down and paved over
[08/12/2022, 22:26:58] Alice Lafferty: So it's meaningless to say that one area is 'more natural' than another when talking farmed land vs towns. And even more so to make value judgements.
[08/12/2022, 22:27:26] Alex Regueiro: I literally gave one, and I don't see any internal inconsistencies.
[08/12/2022, 22:27:41] Alice Lafferty: But agriculture necessarily alters the surrounding ecosystems.
[08/12/2022, 22:27:48] Alex Regueiro: I don't deny that
[08/12/2022, 22:28:14] Alice Lafferty: You don't have to literally tarmac a field to change it.
[08/12/2022, 22:28:17] Alex Regueiro: But the "raw materials", the things being manipulated, are still biological products of nature! Not so in urban environments.
[08/12/2022, 22:28:33] Alice Lafferty: You mean a spectrum of human intervention?
[08/12/2022, 22:28:54] Alex Regueiro: But you would look at a car park and a field of wheat and say they're both unnatural, and refuse to distinguish between degrees of "unnaturalnness"?
[08/12/2022, 22:28:57] Alex Regueiro: That's absurd to me, sorry.
[08/12/2022, 22:29:03] Alice Lafferty: I don't really see how it makes it more 'natural'.
[08/12/2022, 22:29:06] Alex Regueiro: Sure, why not
[08/12/2022, 22:29:17] Alice Lafferty: I think you're using an aesthetic criterion
[08/12/2022, 22:29:38] Alex Regueiro: This is boiling down to semantics now, to connotations of the word. But I'm using it specifically in the sense of density and proximity of flora and fauna.
[08/12/2022, 22:30:01] Alex Regueiro: Aesthetics is another point, related, but still tangential to this one.
[08/12/2022, 22:30:09] Alice Lafferty: You're talking about pure biomass?
[08/12/2022, 22:30:33] Alex Regueiro: That's an overly-scientific way to put it but... I do mean biological life.
[08/12/2022, 22:30:39] Alice Lafferty: I am not, I guess. I'm talking about how the extent to which humans consciously manipulate their environment.
[08/12/2022, 22:31:02] Alice Lafferty: Whether than be biological matter or derived biological matter or other.
[08/12/2022, 22:31:36] Alice Lafferty: In terms of like, biomass or biodiversity or sheer volume of plants and animals then the countryside is more 'natural' yes.
[08/12/2022, 22:31:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, we may just be focusing on different things. This is Wittgenstein's core point about language... most difficulties and disagreements arise just from problematic language! Slightly unclear or divergent interpretations between different people
[08/12/2022, 22:31:57] Alice Lafferty: But these environments don't easily belie the amount of manipulation that has gone into them.
[08/12/2022, 22:32:06] Alex Regueiro: Right but...
[08/12/2022, 22:32:17] Alice Lafferty: As clearly as urban ones do.
[08/12/2022, 22:32:20] Alex Regueiro: Would you still claim that urban environments have not undergone more human manipulation?
[08/12/2022, 22:32:33] Alex Regueiro: Because both have undergone a lot, but to me they're clearly on totally different scales.
[08/12/2022, 22:32:39] Alice Lafferty: Using this definition, then you're right
[08/12/2022, 22:33:37] Alice Lafferty: Honestly? A ploughed field is just as different to a pre-historic British temperate rainforest as a town is.
[08/12/2022, 22:33:46] Alice Lafferty: They're all literally unrecognisable from each other.
[08/12/2022, 22:33:55] Alice Lafferty: I'm doubling down on this point.
[08/12/2022, 22:33:59] Alex Regueiro: Nah, I can't buy that
[08/12/2022, 22:34:29] Alex Regueiro: And temperate rainforests are more than just prehistoric, I thought.
[08/12/2022, 22:34:59] Alice Lafferty: This is why I'm saying you're subjecting them to more aesthetic criteria. The first two certainly 'look' more similar.
[08/12/2022, 22:35:13] Alice Lafferty: And even if there is a difference, it is hugely overexaggerated.
[08/12/2022, 22:35:36] Alice Lafferty: I think my phone screen is broken..
[08/12/2022, 22:36:06] Alex Regueiro: That's because they are in some sense. Nature is disturbed to a moderate extent by agriculture, but an enormous extent by urban construction.
[08/12/2022, 22:37:19] Alex Regueiro: In farming communities you still have soil, flowers and other small plants growing everywhere, a large number of trees (although admittedly many fewer than before humans started farming), diverse wildlife in the form of small mammals, birds, deer, obviously farm animals, etc.
[08/12/2022, 22:37:25] Alex Regueiro: You simply don't have that in urban environments
[08/12/2022, 22:37:39] Alex Regueiro: It might be exaggerated
[08/12/2022, 22:37:48] Alex Regueiro: I won't refute that, since it's hard to quantify anyway
[08/12/2022, 22:38:02] Alex Regueiro: Ah no. Typing too vehemently? üòâ
[08/12/2022, 22:38:30] Alice Lafferty: I meant to say: temperate rainforests made up the majority of surface area of England until ~5000 years ago I think? Although it's hard to find data on this.
[08/12/2022, 22:39:06] Alice Lafferty: But it's completely different soil, flowers and trees from what existed 'naturally'.
[08/12/2022, 22:39:09] Alex Regueiro: Yes, agriculture no doubt contributed to massive deforestation. Though urban growth contributed to *even more*
[08/12/2022, 22:39:29] Alex Regueiro: No, not necessarily with trees and flowers. Probably not so at all.
[08/12/2022, 22:39:30] Alice Lafferty: How can this possibly be true?
[08/12/2022, 22:39:32] Alex Regueiro: Soil, yes, in the fields
[08/12/2022, 22:39:38] Alex Regueiro: But at least there still *is* soil
[08/12/2022, 22:39:43] Alex Regueiro: Why wouldn't it?
[08/12/2022, 22:40:05] Alice Lafferty: Because urban areas make up like a small fraction of the UK's land area.
[08/12/2022, 22:40:53] Alex Regueiro: A small fraction of land but a large fraction of inhabitants. And boy do the people living there notice the lack of nature!
[08/12/2022, 22:41:10] Alex Regueiro: Compared to rural agricultural communities, that is.
[08/12/2022, 22:41:17] Alex Regueiro: Not even compared to prehistoric Britain
[08/12/2022, 22:41:26] Alice Lafferty: How did urban growth contribute to deforestation?
[08/12/2022, 22:41:35] Alex Regueiro: Also, 8% apparently, so far from minute.
[08/12/2022, 22:42:26] Alice Lafferty: Is there a big recorded happiness gap between those living in rural vs urban environments.
[08/12/2022, 22:42:30] Alex Regueiro: Because cities, minus a few parks, roadsides, and lucky people's back gardens, necessitated the clearing of all trees that were previously widespread in rural areas.
[08/12/2022, 22:43:00] Alex Regueiro: I don't think it's the main predictor, but last time I checked, it's still a substantial ones
[08/12/2022, 22:43:14] Alex Regueiro: Also depends heavily on access to greenery within urban environments, I think
[08/12/2022, 22:43:33] Alice Lafferty: Yeah but only on 8% of land. Not *more than agriculture.
[08/12/2022, 22:44:41] Alice Lafferty: Idk. It feels trivially true that being out in natureüå∑üåª or whatever is 'good for your mental health'.

[08/12/2022, 22:45:15] Alex Regueiro: I explain in the note!
[08/12/2022, 22:45:27] Alex Regueiro: Right. It's not the most contentious or interesting point.
[08/12/2022, 22:45:57] Alex Regueiro: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X21000582
[08/12/2022, 22:47:16] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok. I completely agree that urbanisation had the greatest effect on 'people's lives'. I was just pointing out that it doesn't affect huge amounts of the landscape itself. But you're right also that it's a minor point.
[08/12/2022, 22:47:58] Alice Lafferty: Why do they call this 'a paradox'?
[08/12/2022, 22:48:01] Alex Regueiro: I mean, insofar as only 8% of our land is urbanised, I'm not lamenting it as an ecological disaster or anything.
[08/12/2022, 22:48:41] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I was just concerned it was one of those kind of trivial truths that enter our public discourse without being scrutinised.
[08/12/2022, 22:48:42] Alex Regueiro: I wondered too. I think it's because at a global level, the correlation is with greater happiness of urban dwellers?
[08/12/2022, 22:49:10] Alice Lafferty: But maybe there is reason to believe this one is true.
[08/12/2022, 22:49:11] Alex Regueiro: Which is unsurprising, given the material comforts and amenities (you know, running water, electricity, supermarkets) that they provide.
[08/12/2022, 22:49:16] Alice Lafferty: This is just poverty right?
[08/12/2022, 22:49:23] Alice Lafferty: Yeah exactly
[08/12/2022, 22:49:54] Alex Regueiro: Right. Though I suspect it's better in some ways even to be a poor person in the city in an undeveloped country. Just not in developed countries, it seems!
[08/12/2022, 22:49:58] Alice Lafferty: It's more 'natural' to live that way though - so why aren't they happier?üòâ
[08/12/2022, 22:50:15] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[08/12/2022, 22:50:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's fair. It's probably a baked-in cultural assumption to some degree.
[08/12/2022, 22:51:29] Alex Regueiro: Oh, it's very hard to argue people living in a pure state of nature (hunter gatherers?) have a better or happier life in any real sense than us
[08/12/2022, 22:51:33] Alex Regueiro: Though some people do, of course...
[08/12/2022, 22:51:58] Alice Lafferty: Idk... it seems like yuppies want the pretty landscape and rural genteel personas, but cannot help importing the same social codes they use in the city. It all feels really Marie Antoinette playing milkmaid to me.
[08/12/2022, 22:52:34] Alice Lafferty: I don't think that saying something is 'natural' or 'unnatural' is a valid argument for or against something.
[08/12/2022, 22:52:37] Alice Lafferty: Basically
[08/12/2022, 22:52:39] Alex Regueiro: I'm kind of sympathetic to Hobbes about the "state of nature", though obviously that focuses more on societal structures than the way I've been using "nature" here.
[08/12/2022, 22:54:04] Alex Regueiro: This has honestly crossed my mind. I think they're partly living in delusion (esp. re social codes), but I can't humanly begrudge them their wish to be "closer to nature". It's built into our psychology by evolution to find satisfaction and beauty in such environments.
[08/12/2022, 22:54:33] Alice Lafferty: This doesn't make any sense.
[08/12/2022, 22:54:40] Alex Regueiro: Elaborate
[08/12/2022, 22:55:07] Alex Regueiro: If you can bring most material comforts to the countryside, as in developed nations, I see no reason why people shouldn't prefer it.
[08/12/2022, 22:55:07] Alice Lafferty: 'Built into our psychology to find beauty in such environments'
[08/12/2022, 22:55:25] Alice Lafferty: Those environments are changed beyond recognition of what existed when we first encountered them.
[08/12/2022, 22:55:32] Alex Regueiro: I mean, we could get into a debate about what beauty means now but...
[08/12/2022, 22:55:48] Alex Regueiro: We're certainly more adapted to live surrounded by trees and plants than concrete and steel.
[08/12/2022, 22:55:52] Alice Lafferty: We cannot have 'evolved' to like them.
[08/12/2022, 22:56:10] Alex Regueiro: No, it's a byproduct of what we've evolved to find comfortable and anxiolytic.
[08/12/2022, 22:56:12] Alice Lafferty: Eh not more than we like running water.
[08/12/2022, 22:56:36] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely. But see my above comment about developed nations. üôÇ
[08/12/2022, 22:57:03] Alex Regueiro: This whole debate is a very privileged one. A true "first-world problem"
[08/12/2022, 22:57:11] Alex Regueiro: That's only really become possible in recent decades
[08/12/2022, 22:57:11] Alice Lafferty: Interestingly some people moving from cities to countryside report boredom, but they might be a minority.
[08/12/2022, 22:57:25] Alex Regueiro: I can believe that. Honestly not sure on the statistics.
[08/12/2022, 22:58:03] Alice Lafferty: So naturalness (to mean 'untouchedness') is not a priority for you
[08/12/2022, 22:58:09] Alex Regueiro: My ideas of excitement and boredom are pretty atypical in many ways, so I'm not sure how much I can empathise. But as you know, I've sung the virtues of cities before too!
[08/12/2022, 22:58:20] Alice Lafferty: Yes it definitely is.
[08/12/2022, 22:58:22] Alex Regueiro: Not a big one. A minor one perhaps.
[08/12/2022, 22:58:35] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[08/12/2022, 22:58:39] Alex Regueiro: I think your definition of naturalness is very much influenced by permaculture?
[08/12/2022, 22:58:41] Alex Regueiro: Which is fair enough
[08/12/2022, 22:59:30] Alice Lafferty: I was going to connect this more generally to people condemning certain lifestyles or practises as 'unnatural'. At some point anyway...
[08/12/2022, 22:59:37] Alex Regueiro: For ecological/environmental reasons it might be a worthwhile pursuit still. And even for tourism to some extent. But it's sort of irrelevant in terms of everyday human life and concerns
[08/12/2022, 22:59:43] Alice Lafferty: And how 'naturalness' has become a shibboleth.
[08/12/2022, 22:59:50] Alice Lafferty: On some parts of the right.
[08/12/2022, 23:00:02] Alex Regueiro: Hah I see
[08/12/2022, 23:00:09] Alex Regueiro: I honestly don't think that's a very strong argument
[08/12/2022, 23:00:11] Alex Regueiro: funnily enough...
[08/12/2022, 23:00:14] Alice Lafferty: Right.
[08/12/2022, 23:00:20] Alex Regueiro: Conservative religious types don't embrace it at all!
[08/12/2022, 23:00:25] Alex Regueiro: At least ones who truly understand religion.
[08/12/2022, 23:00:41] Alex Regueiro: I mean, we're sinful in our natural state, for Christ's sake!
[08/12/2022, 23:00:59] Alice Lafferty: Because most of their conceptions of the natural are not well-defined, and then it's not clear why it's desirable.
[08/12/2022, 23:01:08] Alex Regueiro: We should constantly be fighting natural urges and tendencies and embracing Godliness
[08/12/2022, 23:01:08] Alice Lafferty: I agree
[08/12/2022, 23:01:09] Alex Regueiro: etc. etc.
[08/12/2022, 23:01:41] Alice Lafferty: Total deprivationüòî
[08/12/2022, 23:01:44] Alex Regueiro: That's one thing secular types tend to get horribly wrong about religious types too, I think. Traditional Christians totally reject the "natural is good" argument
[08/12/2022, 23:01:58] Alex Regueiro: True
[08/12/2022, 23:02:00] Alice Lafferty: But some do because some unsophisticated 'God made it this way'
[08/12/2022, 23:02:14] Alice Lafferty: So there's lots of incoherence round those parts.
[08/12/2022, 23:02:31] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Let's not get onto original sin though!
[08/12/2022, 23:02:33] Alex Regueiro: Not right now
[08/12/2022, 23:02:53] Alex Regueiro: It's easy to have a lot of dissonance on this topic unless you really work through these ideas, I think. I mean, as a Christian, for example.
[08/12/2022, 23:03:23] Alice Lafferty: Having encountered a lot of religious people within the last year esp, I'd say the average layman actually takes a naive Rousseauian view of nature.
[08/12/2022, 23:04:06] Alice Lafferty: You have to talk to the 80 year old really black-pilled Russian Orthodox if you want the more traditional view.
[08/12/2022, 23:04:44] Alex Regueiro: The story of Garden of Eden kind of exemplifies this superficial paradox about (the state of) nature, I'd say.
[08/12/2022, 23:04:55] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes
[08/12/2022, 23:05:07] Alex Regueiro: Or the Calvinist guy from the salon!
[08/12/2022, 23:07:36] Alex Regueiro: A couple of the liberal types got into a debate with him at one point which basically went like:
"But it's totally natural for people to want to have sex with lots of people outside of marriage. Surely that's a good thing?"
"No, you just don't get it! Christianity says that our nature is sinful. We should be fighting it. Morality isn't based on what is or supposedly is natural."
[08/12/2022, 23:08:07] Alex Regueiro: Even though I'm sure I'd disagree with those types on loads of things, I think I'd find it really fascinating still.
[08/12/2022, 23:10:43] Alex Regueiro: An Italian friend of mine used to live near a priest who infamously got kicked out of the Lefebvrists for being too traditionalist! Had dinner at his place a few times. Fun.
[08/12/2022, 23:10:58] Alex Regueiro: Society of Pius or whatever it's called...
[09/12/2022, 15:13:18] Alex Regueiro: So‚Ä¶ Can you make it tonight or not? üôÇ
[09/12/2022, 15:58:21] Alex Regueiro: Need to know ASAP, sorry!
[09/12/2022, 18:27:53] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôm going with my dad
[09/12/2022, 18:41:14] Alice Lafferty: I am so sorry, I forgot to mention it yesterday and had my phone switched off!
[09/12/2022, 18:41:27] Alice Lafferty: Good! I hope you have a nice time
[09/12/2022, 21:36:48] Alice Lafferty: Was it as good as you'd expected? Worth missing the Argentina game?
[10/12/2022, 17:28:30] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[10/12/2022, 17:28:51] Alex Regueiro: Haha fortunately it worked out in the end.
[10/12/2022, 17:29:02] Alex Regueiro: I don‚Äôt normally mind your sudden disappearances, but yeah, that one was less than ideal haha!
[10/12/2022, 17:29:24] Alex Regueiro: It was superb, thank you.
[10/12/2022, 17:29:37] Alex Regueiro: You don't know what you missed out on. üôÇ
[10/12/2022, 17:30:02] Alex Regueiro: Madness. I was checking the score, and saw the highlights and reactions. Did you watch it?
[10/12/2022, 17:30:27] Alex Regueiro: My sister was on an emotional rollercoaster at some bar in BA.
[10/12/2022, 17:31:00] Alice Lafferty: I know sorry! Hope you weren't scrabbling around before you left
[10/12/2022, 17:31:03] Alex Regueiro: How do you feel about the England game now? Going to watch it with all the Lafferty family?
[10/12/2022, 17:31:21] Alice Lafferty: I started watching in the 2nd half
[10/12/2022, 17:32:01] Alice Lafferty: Haha it was so tense! The crowd in Qatar was like 90% Argentine which was interesting. Apparently people were selling cars for tickets and stuff
[10/12/2022, 17:32:02] Alex Regueiro: No, it was fairly last minute, but I'd assumed you couldn't make it a few hours before I left.
[10/12/2022, 17:32:30] Alice Lafferty: I'm glad you enjoyed it, your dad did too?
[10/12/2022, 17:33:02] Alex Regueiro: I'm disappointed you missed out on a marvellous concert much more than not hearing from you in time!
‚Äé[10/12/2022, 17:33:20] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[10/12/2022, 17:33:25] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely, he loved it
[10/12/2022, 17:33:31] Alice Lafferty: Yes we left early enough to be back by 6:30pm!
[10/12/2022, 17:33:42] Alex Regueiro: So at least there was no loss with the ticket, that's for sure!
[10/12/2022, 17:33:50] Alex Regueiro: Oh right, I thought you might be watching it there
[10/12/2022, 17:33:51] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good though
[10/12/2022, 17:33:53] Alice Lafferty: There was a bit of snow in Manchester
[10/12/2022, 17:34:09] Alice Lafferty: You got fantastic seats?
[10/12/2022, 17:34:16] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[10/12/2022, 17:34:20] Alice Lafferty: Much better than when we sat behind a pillar
[10/12/2022, 17:34:24] Alex Regueiro: Not cheap but second row... such a great view
[10/12/2022, 17:34:40] Alice Lafferty: How old is that guy? He was still on good form?
[10/12/2022, 17:34:40] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes... but probably just as well, given how strident the Shostakovich was in parts?!
[10/12/2022, 17:34:54] Alex Regueiro: He looks older than he is. I was talking about that with my dad.
[10/12/2022, 17:34:55] Alex Regueiro: Only 68
[10/12/2022, 17:35:06] Alex Regueiro: Yes, still at the top of his game
[10/12/2022, 17:35:23] Alex Regueiro: (Let's hope we can say the same about England)
[10/12/2022, 17:35:41] Alice Lafferty: I know... it is a shame. But I only a regret it a bit because it was good to be in bed by 10pm last night.
[10/12/2022, 17:35:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I totally understand
[10/12/2022, 17:36:02] Alice Lafferty: Maybe it's just he slightly hunched.
[10/12/2022, 17:36:26] Alex Regueiro: It was obviously less than ideal not hearing from you, but it's quite forgivable, and I do sympathise with you wanting to get an early night!
[10/12/2022, 17:36:28] Alice Lafferty: Ha
[10/12/2022, 17:36:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. To a small extent you have to be when you play, but you're right... He has quite a few lines on his face too!
[10/12/2022, 17:37:05] Alice Lafferty: I am sorry about that. It wasn't deliberate, I sometimes switch my phone off for a few hours a day in order to actually get other stuff done.
[10/12/2022, 17:37:14] Alice Lafferty: My parents have similar issues contacting me.
[10/12/2022, 17:37:23] Alice Lafferty: So I'm probably going to end that practice.
‚Äé[10/12/2022, 17:37:28] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[10/12/2022, 17:38:27] Alex Regueiro: No need to apologise again, really. I knew it wasn't intentional even then! I can tell you felt bad. Forget about it. üôÇ
[10/12/2022, 17:39:11] Alice Lafferty: Interesting. I like the jacket actually.
[10/12/2022, 17:39:26] Alex Regueiro: He did a bit of speaking in-between pieces, introducing everything. But in a stimulating and tasteful, not excessive manner. He knows the history/background of the music he plays really well.
[10/12/2022, 17:39:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's kind of cool hah. It's really loose, which I can sympathise with. Easier to play in.
[10/12/2022, 17:39:41] Alice Lafferty: Thanks
[10/12/2022, 17:40:14] Alex Regueiro: Anyway did you have a nice day in Mankville?
[10/12/2022, 17:40:23] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, with your brother
[10/12/2022, 17:40:43] Alice Lafferty: How often does he do concerts?
[10/12/2022, 17:41:32] Alex Regueiro: It depends. I'll sometimes go to 3/4 in a month (that's maybe a bit much) then go 3/4 months without seeing any. Or much longer over the pandemic, of course.
[10/12/2022, 17:41:53] Alice Lafferty: Yes that makes sense. It kind of surprises me when the female members go through hair and makeup and wear kind of uncomfortable looking dresses
[10/12/2022, 17:42:09] Alice Lafferty: It was ok!
[10/12/2022, 17:42:54] Alice Lafferty: Not in retrospect worth missing this musical experience you have been describing... but it was nice to see him anyway.
[10/12/2022, 17:42:56] Alex Regueiro: Yep, and high heels! They're often sitting down, but still... I don't know how women stand them.
[10/12/2022, 17:43:20] Alex Regueiro: It's fine. He does a few each year. Hopefully you can come to a future one... or another equally great concert.
[10/12/2022, 17:43:23] Alice Lafferty: I see, and that's internationally too? So you won't catch him in London too often.
[10/12/2022, 17:43:50] Alice Lafferty: Right do they not use the pedals?
[10/12/2022, 17:44:12] Alex Regueiro: Quite unintentional. Sometimes friends will want to go with me, or even parents. And sometimes it's just that good concerts can be like buses...
[10/12/2022, 17:44:34] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[10/12/2022, 17:44:57] Alex Regueiro: I don't think women pianists wear high heels. That would indeed be brutal. But violinists and woodwind players often do. And singers who are standing.
[10/12/2022, 17:45:01] Alex Regueiro: Bad enough
[10/12/2022, 17:45:28] Alex Regueiro: He lives in London (Hungarian emigr√© since decades ago) but he doesn't do tooo many a year.
[10/12/2022, 17:45:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh that makes sense yes
[10/12/2022, 17:45:56] Alex Regueiro: BTW, speaking of eccentric geniuses... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WTH6288UG8
[10/12/2022, 17:45:59] Alice Lafferty: Ohh I see. Maybe he's had a difficult life.
[10/12/2022, 17:46:00] Alex Regueiro: First interview in many a year.
[10/12/2022, 17:46:35] Alice Lafferty: Haha I haven't seen this! Is it a good interview?
[10/12/2022, 17:46:46] Alex Regueiro: I'm honestly not sure. Probably left because of the communist regime initially, though he's pretty liberal-progressive, so he definitely wouldn't return to Hungary now, and has spoken about it.
[10/12/2022, 17:47:39] Alex Regueiro: His parents would have lived through the Nazi days. Not sure if they were in camps/murdered though.
[10/12/2022, 17:47:40] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting.
[10/12/2022, 17:48:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's pretty good. Just what you'd expect from Morrissey really!
[10/12/2022, 17:48:18] Alex Regueiro: Very recent
[10/12/2022, 17:48:19] Alice Lafferty: Strong liberal convictions of that generation makes sense with that backdrop.
[10/12/2022, 17:48:57] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I certainly don't begrudge him. We're all shaped strongly by our environments and our parents' backgrounds/experiences!
[10/12/2022, 17:49:02] Alice Lafferty: Ok I'm definitely going to listen. Does he make any gaffes about England for the English or whatever? Probably not or it wouldn't have been published
[10/12/2022, 17:49:08] Alex Regueiro: He would have lived through the Hungarian Uprising however
[10/12/2022, 17:49:14] Alex Regueiro: Well, maybe too young to remember it
[10/12/2022, 17:49:36] Alex Regueiro: Hah nope. But he speaks his mind! Based as ever.
[10/12/2022, 17:50:05] Alice Lafferty: That's what I was thinking. It was as early as the 1950s?
[10/12/2022, 17:50:16] Alex Regueiro: 56
[10/12/2022, 17:50:24] Alex Regueiro: so he would have been 2/3
[10/12/2022, 17:50:38] Alex Regueiro: Anyway I'm pretty sure he's not a tankie at least üòâ
[10/12/2022, 17:50:56] Alice Lafferty: Haha def not
[10/12/2022, 17:52:41] Alex Regueiro: I think I sent you to his performance of the French Overture right?
[10/12/2022, 17:53:46] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, going out for an Indian meal with the family now, and hopefully nothing will have happened in the game before we get back!
[10/12/2022, 17:54:46] Alice Lafferty: Wait I thought it starts at 7pm?
[10/12/2022, 17:55:15] Alice Lafferty: You'll have plenty of time I think
[10/12/2022, 17:55:19] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I know, less than great timing...
[10/12/2022, 17:55:23] Alex Regueiro: But we won't miss much
[10/12/2022, 17:55:28] Alex Regueiro: Had already planned it
[10/12/2022, 17:55:50] Alex Regueiro: I'm a slow eater, but yeah, not too bad still!
[10/12/2022, 17:55:54] Alice Lafferty: My dad's been making us have dinner early on days he wants to watch the games.
[10/12/2022, 17:56:05] Alice Lafferty: We literally didn't get to have dinner tonight :)
[10/12/2022, 17:56:13] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair
[10/12/2022, 17:56:24] Alice Lafferty: Not worth getting a take away tonight?
[10/12/2022, 17:56:24] Alex Regueiro: Does he cook normally, or your mum?
[10/12/2022, 17:56:45] Alice Lafferty: Of course not, my mum does the actual cooking and he just dictates
[10/12/2022, 17:56:56] Alex Regueiro: Doesn't bother you too much given your eating schedule, I'm guessing?
[10/12/2022, 17:57:30] Alice Lafferty: No not personally! I will get a snack when we get home anyway
[10/12/2022, 17:57:31] Alex Regueiro: Haha very conventional familial division of labour then
[10/12/2022, 17:58:05] Alex Regueiro: Ah, you're in the car still.... Hope you don't get carsick. Else it's a good thing I'm going in a min!
[10/12/2022, 17:58:13] Alice Lafferty: Are you going to be at home too? The atmosphere in pubs will probably be great.
[10/12/2022, 17:58:40] Alice Lafferty: I don't usually suffer that badly from it!
[10/12/2022, 17:59:50] Alex Regueiro: Oh okay good. If I'm on my phone much in the car the consequences are pretty ugly!
[10/12/2022, 18:00:19] Alex Regueiro: Probably. Since I don't have any friends in Loughton any more
[10/12/2022, 18:00:44] Alice Lafferty: My mum has a theory that what causes the nausea is not reading/using phone but specifically tilting your head down.
[10/12/2022, 18:00:47] Alex Regueiro: On the proviso we beat the Grenouilles, we could see the semis at a pub if you fancy?
[10/12/2022, 18:01:14] Alice Lafferty: So if she holds her phone up to her face, she doesn't experience it.
[10/12/2022, 18:01:29] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I always presumed it was more the lack of a stable reference point of vision combined with the jostling of the car. Looking into the distance does help. But that could equally be the head thing!
[10/12/2022, 18:01:55] Alex Regueiro: Okay, good to know! I might have to do an experiment with that. Of the most rigorously scientific kind, of course. Thanks.
[10/12/2022, 18:02:20] Alice Lafferty: ü§ûI'd kind of like to experience it, even though it's not the sort of environment I usually put myself in.!
[10/12/2022, 18:02:25] Alice Lafferty: It just looks so convivial!
[10/12/2022, 18:02:49] Alice Lafferty: That's what I thought too but it apparently works for her.
[10/12/2022, 18:02:56] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's exactly what I thought you'd say! üôÇ
[10/12/2022, 18:02:59] Alex Regueiro: Let's see
[10/12/2022, 18:03:04] Alex Regueiro: Not count our chickens at all...
[10/12/2022, 18:03:21] Alice Lafferty: It could just be that bringing the phone/book right up close to her face prevents her from experiencing the motion and sickness.
[10/12/2022, 18:03:35] Alice Lafferty: It's worth trying!
[10/12/2022, 18:03:37] Alex Regueiro: I'm glad. I'll report back, and either send my thanks or annoyance! üòâ
[10/12/2022, 18:03:45] Alice Lafferty: Right exactly
[10/12/2022, 18:03:54] Alex Regueiro: and all*
[10/12/2022, 18:04:48] Alex Regueiro: Or rather, regret. The suggestion in itself is harmless and appreciated. But nausea is never fun...
[10/12/2022, 18:05:42] Alice Lafferty: You could invest in these hilarious things: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Upgraded-Sickness-Ultra-Light-Portable-Seasickness/dp/B088MC7JRC
[10/12/2022, 18:05:51] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[10/12/2022, 18:06:04] Alex Regueiro: I might do. For the comedic effect if nothing else.
[10/12/2022, 18:06:48] Alice Lafferty: !
[10/12/2022, 18:08:10] Alex Regueiro: I'm off. See you later.
[10/12/2022, 18:08:16] Alex Regueiro: üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø
[10/12/2022, 18:08:53] Alice Lafferty: ü´°üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø
[10/12/2022, 18:09:15] Alice Lafferty: You have no idea how long it took me to find those emojis.
[10/12/2022, 18:09:15] Alex Regueiro: And I hope you caught my selfies in my England (and Argentina) shirt on Instagram the other day! And the cheap jibe at the Welsh. So you must never doubt I'm a good patriotic Englishman!
[10/12/2022, 18:09:41] Alice Lafferty: Wait I'm going to look again
[10/12/2022, 19:34:40] Alice Lafferty: Ref is a crypto-gaul
[10/12/2022, 19:42:37] Alex Regueiro: Yes! My sis texted me just 5 mins earlier saying he‚Äôs almost as bad as the ref in the Arg game.
[10/12/2022, 19:43:07] Alex Regueiro: And I saw him miss a foul on Saka just after I turned it on.
[10/12/2022, 19:58:58] Alex Regueiro: Seen the two big controversies now. Ref should be ashamed!
[10/12/2022, 21:29:31] Alex Regueiro: üôÅ
[10/12/2022, 22:13:42] Alice Lafferty: That was difficult
[10/12/2022, 22:14:00] Alice Lafferty: Glad now that I wasn't in fact in bar.
[10/12/2022, 22:21:39] Alex Regueiro: Heh yeah
[10/12/2022, 22:22:02] Alex Regueiro: That was kind of painful. The usual when you support England, but still...
[10/12/2022, 22:22:25] Alex Regueiro: VAR saved the second half from being a refereeing fiasco like the first, mind you.
[10/12/2022, 22:23:02] Alex Regueiro: And oh, Kane...
[11/12/2022, 19:31:42] Alice Lafferty: :( do you think that was his last world cup?!
[11/12/2022, 19:31:45] Alice Lafferty: *
[11/12/2022, 19:33:08] Alice Lafferty: Oh well. I'm now passively supporting Argentina with the assumption that they will appear in the final against Fr*nce.
‚Äé[11/12/2022, 19:52:56] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/12/2022, 19:54:12] Alex Regueiro: Hope so. I don't rate him really (in a few ways). The lads generally did us proud though.
[11/12/2022, 19:55:41] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. It's the final I predicted before it all kicked off. Fingers crossed the Argies can do it and put the French back where they belong.
[11/12/2022, 19:55:42] Alex Regueiro: I reckon we can loan them the Falklands for a year as a reward, no?
[11/12/2022, 20:25:46] Alice Lafferty: I know!!!!!
[11/12/2022, 20:27:31] Alice Lafferty: Trying to go out and get some good pictures.
[11/12/2022, 20:35:24] Alex Regueiro: Send me any good ones! I got a video, but no particularly great pics.
[11/12/2022, 20:37:14] Alice Lafferty: It's falling a good inch thick here. I mean, enough to make proper snowballs.
[11/12/2022, 20:37:37] Alex Regueiro: It was 40 degrees in Argentina the other day. I can't stress enough how much I prefer this sort of extreme weather.
[11/12/2022, 20:37:57] Alice Lafferty: You're the one with the iPhone 12 or whatever!
[11/12/2022, 20:38:13] Alice Lafferty: Same

[11/12/2022, 20:40:46] Alex Regueiro: Lovely
[11/12/2022, 20:41:48] Alex Regueiro: Ehh that was meant to send as a short video.
[11/12/2022, 20:42:31] Alex Regueiro: Time to lure your brother outside and pelt him with snowballs!
[11/12/2022, 20:46:39] Alice Lafferty: Have already done so to my dad.
[11/12/2022, 20:46:50] Alice Lafferty: So everyone has their guard up nowüòí
[11/12/2022, 20:49:34] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah, that's the problem...
[11/12/2022, 20:52:38] Alice Lafferty: I'm very happy about this. May it continue into proper Christmas.
‚Äé[11/12/2022, 20:53:03] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/12/2022, 20:54:08] Alex Regueiro: Real, I take it
[11/12/2022, 20:54:11] Alice Lafferty: We lost the angel that is supposed to go on the top so now we have this (crass imo) red bow.
[11/12/2022, 20:54:11] Alex Regueiro: We usually have a nice big one like that too, but this year my mum wanted to go for something small and manageable...
[11/12/2022, 20:54:25] Alice Lafferty: Let's see
[11/12/2022, 20:54:31] Alice Lafferty: Ofc
‚Äé[11/12/2022, 20:55:25] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/12/2022, 20:55:49] Alice Lafferty: It's very cute.
[11/12/2022, 20:55:59] Alice Lafferty: Are you still going to put presents underneath it?
[11/12/2022, 20:56:47] Alex Regueiro: Yep, short and sweet. Exactly unlike me.
[11/12/2022, 20:57:06] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, but not particular rush... I'm impressed you have some under yours already!
[11/12/2022, 20:57:55] Alice Lafferty: Yeah not very many. I think from extended family. They're all going to be magically delivered soon by Santa
[11/12/2022, 20:58:09] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, an angel definitely wins
[11/12/2022, 20:58:37] Alex Regueiro: Or better still, a seraph!
[11/12/2022, 20:59:21] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. Keep the magic alive!
[13/12/2022, 02:26:52] Alice Lafferty: Have you read The Cathedral and the Bazaar?
[13/12/2022, 02:30:18] Alex Regueiro: I haven't, no.
[13/12/2022, 02:30:22] Alex Regueiro: Very influential book though
[13/12/2022, 18:11:14] Alex Regueiro: If you deliberately held off replying to my reply last night, thank you... was just getting ready for bed. üòÄ
[13/12/2022, 18:11:21] Alex Regueiro: Watching the Argentina-Croatia game I hope??
[13/12/2022, 19:02:10] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to eat now but will tune in at like 7:15
[13/12/2022, 19:42:26] Alice Lafferty: I mean there's no way the Netherlands are gonna come back from this
[13/12/2022, 19:42:50] Alex Regueiro: Certainly not, considering they went out in the previous round! üòâ
[13/12/2022, 19:43:03] Alice Lafferty: Ugh I mean Croatia
[13/12/2022, 19:43:05] Alex Regueiro: (Sorry, couldn't resist)
[13/12/2022, 19:43:08] Alice Lafferty: What the hell
[13/12/2022, 19:43:10] Alex Regueiro: But yeah I agree
[13/12/2022, 19:43:25] Alex Regueiro: You caught both goals? I was having a cheeky TV dinner.
[13/12/2022, 21:05:54] Alex Regueiro: üéâ
[14/12/2022, 19:34:46] Alice Lafferty: üëè
[14/12/2022, 20:35:09] Alex Regueiro: How are you doing? üòä
[14/12/2022, 20:38:29] Alex Regueiro: Just heading back from London. Went to a nice carol service with a friend. We were just at the pub watching Morocco dominate France! Incredible they still haven‚Äôt scored.
[15/12/2022, 21:35:05] Alice Lafferty: Oh nice, where did you go??
[15/12/2022, 21:36:26] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to a carol service next Wednesday at St Alban's Cathedral.
[15/12/2022, 23:53:25] Alex Regueiro: St Stephen Walbrook in the City. Was really nice. A mixture of a proper choir singing and everyone joining in. Plus a few readings.
[15/12/2022, 23:53:25] Alex Regueiro: Wren church I believe
[15/12/2022, 23:53:25] Alex Regueiro: Sounds great. Did your school invite you or just going with family?
[16/12/2022, 00:01:33] Alex Regueiro: FYI I told people you might come for drinks after the dinner on Saturday. They‚Äôre all cool with it if course. üòä
[16/12/2022, 00:01:49] Alex Regueiro: One or two others are probably doing the same.
[16/12/2022, 01:17:35] Alice Lafferty: Ahh nice, I'm going to look it up
[16/12/2022, 01:19:01] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I think we get priority tickets or something. It's always almost entirely filled with OAs so
[16/12/2022, 01:19:20] Alice Lafferty: Ok, thanks :) what time should I be there?
[16/12/2022, 01:26:49] Alex Regueiro: üôÇ
‚Äé[16/12/2022, 01:27:24] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[16/12/2022, 01:28:00] Alex Regueiro: Hah, fair. I'm sure it will be lovely though. Can't remember if I've ever been there...
[16/12/2022, 01:30:07] Alex Regueiro: Say 9:00 or a little after? Dinner is for 7:00, so that gives us plenty of time. But it's really no big deal if we're still having desserts when you arrive.
[16/12/2022, 13:21:27] Alice Lafferty: Very nice
[16/12/2022, 13:22:04] Alice Lafferty: And could you remind me of the name of the pub!
[16/12/2022, 13:34:48] Alex Regueiro: Duke of Cambridge, Battersea
[16/12/2022, 13:38:32] Alex Regueiro: You never followed up on this by the way‚Ä¶ How‚Äôd you come across it?
[17/12/2022, 07:28:01] Alice Lafferty: How the hell are you getting there? https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/strikes
[17/12/2022, 07:28:32] Alice Lafferty: I saw it referenced in another piece of writing, and was wondering whether it was worth buying!
[17/12/2022, 14:35:50] Alex Regueiro: Reminds me‚Ä¶ How‚Äôs the Emperor‚Äôs New Mind coming along?
[17/12/2022, 14:49:55] Alex Regueiro: It only affects some lines so should be fine if you avoid them!
[17/12/2022, 14:50:05] Alex Regueiro: Is it a particular pain for you?
[17/12/2022, 15:06:32] Alex Regueiro: https://youtu.be/lDlkAQYERcQ
[17/12/2022, 15:08:14] Alex Regueiro: My dad just linked me to that. I think I watched it some time ago and it was interesting but not really along the lines of how I think of it. Still good though, if you‚Äôre curious.
[17/12/2022, 18:11:30] Alex Regueiro: Don‚Äôt worry if you have to flake tonight
[17/12/2022, 18:11:40] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôd understand
[17/12/2022, 19:04:45] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure, it's suggesting that I take a bus
[17/12/2022, 19:05:19] Alice Lafferty: Thanks, I'll watch it later
[17/12/2022, 19:09:30] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôm just taking a cab from Battersea Power Station (Northern Line) but yeah bus gets you closer than Tube.
[17/12/2022, 19:09:30] Alex Regueiro: Totally up to you if you want to bother. It would be nice to see you there but no big deal if not!
[17/12/2022, 19:38:08] Alex Regueiro: If you do come let‚Äôs operate on the pretence we‚Äôre just friends who met via another friend, yeah? üòâ
[17/12/2022, 20:47:16] Alex Regueiro: It‚Äôs all a bit delayed FYI
[17/12/2022, 20:47:30] Alex Regueiro: Are you coming or not?
[17/12/2022, 21:16:04] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, no, the travel seemed to difficult in the end. I hope you're having a nice time!
[18/12/2022, 00:35:03] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I definitely don‚Äôt blame you for flaking this time haha. The other two who were thinking of coming just for drinks did the same. And half of us were pretty late anyway.
[18/12/2022, 00:35:04] Alex Regueiro: If you‚Äôre still up for it you‚Äôre very welcome to come to the first salon next year though. Probably 2nd week of Jan.
‚Äé[18/12/2022, 23:23:32] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[18/12/2022, 23:24:37] Alice Lafferty: I'm happy overall though... your sister and her family must be going crazy?
[19/12/2022, 00:04:08] Alex Regueiro: Hah
[19/12/2022, 00:04:50] Alex Regueiro: Mbappe was impressive once he and the French team woke up after 75 minutes! Was a shame Argentina couldn't close it out then... I suppose they wanted to give us the full drama and emotional rollercoaster eh?
[19/12/2022, 00:05:35] Alex Regueiro: We won't see another player like Messi again though. I love his personality too. So glad he could finally win it! üôÇ
[19/12/2022, 00:06:36] Alex Regueiro: Yep they're not really football fans (even him, very rare for an Argentine) but they watched it with friends and had a great time!üòÄ
[19/12/2022, 00:08:44] Alex Regueiro: I think they went to the main square (with the obelisk) afterwards... briefly at least. Atmosphere looked crazy indeed.
[20/12/2022, 06:12:32] Alice Lafferty: This was the first football tournament I've followed properly and I'm not sure if anything else will ever live up to it...
[20/12/2022, 06:13:17] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I kind of saw on the news..
[20/12/2022, 06:13:34] Alice Lafferty: I forgot to ask- how was the Christmas party in the end?
[20/12/2022, 15:35:07] Alex Regueiro: Yes, you may have to quit while you're on top! As Messi should probably do now. The farce around Qatar hosting it aside, knockout rounds had some incredibly entertaining games.
[20/12/2022, 15:35:34] Alex Regueiro: https://www.instagram.com/p/CmYyND_OYMl/?fbclid=IwAR1g2vQkZrMWBZqXhx4iNjBE-HSuFB-LEFoMhc-bDd87JQKKbfdEGI1PbxQ

[20/12/2022, 15:37:34] Alex Regueiro: It was lovely, thanks. We just had a chilled dinner and chatted around the table. No proper drinking sesh or anything!
‚Äé[20/12/2022, 15:37:58] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[20/12/2022, 19:31:01] Alice Lafferty: The Emilio Martinez one in front of the emir...
[20/12/2022, 19:32:39] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. I saw that live and wanted to facepalm.
[20/12/2022, 19:32:53] Alex Regueiro: Heroic performance not-quite-undone by schoolboy antics.
[22/12/2022, 20:56:37] Alex Regueiro: Heya
[22/12/2022, 20:56:44] Alex Regueiro: How was the carol service last night?
[23/12/2022, 08:05:49] Alice Lafferty: It was very good, thank you. They played the nine lessons & four motets, and some popular favourites. Taverner's setting of The Lamb by William Blake was my personal highlight..
‚Äé[23/12/2022, 08:06:38] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/12/2022, 08:07:56] Alice Lafferty: What was the service at the one you went to by the way?
[23/12/2022, 16:49:25] Alex Regueiro: Sounds lovely!
[23/12/2022, 16:49:40] Alex Regueiro: I'm not familiar with the "nine lessons and four motets" actually
[23/12/2022, 16:50:19] Alex Regueiro: Though I certainly know the Lamb. That's a beautiful piece.
[23/12/2022, 16:51:14] Alex Regueiro: I love the fact there are two famous John Taverner's, both composers of sacred music!
[23/12/2022, 16:51:41] Alex Regueiro: I think the Renaissance one was a Lincolnshire lad
[23/12/2022, 16:53:18] Alex Regueiro: Aww. Looks like a distinguished old gentleman there. Festive too, of course.
[23/12/2022, 16:57:54] Alex Regueiro: We put a festive collar on the cat once, but suffice to say she was NOT pleased.
[23/12/2022, 16:58:06] Alex Regueiro: I forget some of the ones that just the church choir sang. The ones everyone sang were traditional carols, naturally. There were also readings and a blessing of the crib.
[24/12/2022, 01:06:47] Alice Lafferty: I think I've only listened to the contemporary Tavener. I'm going to look up the other one now. But yes in general I love Christmas music towards the more sombre end of the spectrum. Have to make people listen to In the Bleak Midwinter in case they were feeling too cheerful...

Have you entered into the Christmas spirit? I felt really profoundly alienated while listening to Slade in a Sainsbury's today.
[24/12/2022, 01:07:51] Alice Lafferty: Otis accepted the collar but we learnt that the reindeer antlers were a step too far for him.
[24/12/2022, 01:13:42] Alex Regueiro: I was going to say it's only right you should prefer that, as a theology student, even an agnostic (if that's fair to say)! But it's simpler than that really, isn't it... It's just better music? And I think it just suits your personality better too? It does mine.
[24/12/2022, 01:15:04] Alex Regueiro: Not to be pretentious, but I like the morsel of spiritual/transcendent emotion that a good Christmas carol or religious piece gives. üôÇ
[24/12/2022, 01:16:48] Alex Regueiro: I think you mean Wizzard, right? Two of the easiest bands to confuse. Both being 70s glam rock from Birmingham!
[24/12/2022, 01:17:36] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[24/12/2022, 01:17:44] Alice Lafferty: No I meant this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8KT365wlA
[24/12/2022, 01:18:36] Alex Regueiro: I can't say I've fully gotten into the Christmas spirit for years. On the religious end, I'm always going to fall short, and equally something will always bother me about the obscene commercialisation of Christmas. The Don Cupit quote comes to mind
[24/12/2022, 01:19:12] Alex Regueiro: Oh right, sorry. I'm more familiar with Wizzard's "I wish it could be Christmas every day", but yeah, I know that one too.
[24/12/2022, 01:19:37] Alex Regueiro: But, ahem, I'm not going to turn down presents still!
[24/12/2022, 01:20:01] Alice Lafferty: To be honest Christmas should really only be understood in the shadow of the Easter Passion, which is the actual high point of the liturgical year....
[24/12/2022, 01:20:30] Alice Lafferty: I barely remember the band names actually.
[24/12/2022, 01:20:52] Alice Lafferty: Exactly...
[24/12/2022, 01:21:14] Alex Regueiro: Right. My dad used to always say something like that to me. The remnant of the Catholic indoctrination of his youth!
[24/12/2022, 01:21:44] Alice Lafferty: Yeah the religious aspect died ages ago.
[24/12/2022, 01:22:42] Alex Regueiro: Still, B I think all but your Cromwellian types (how many of those are left?) find Christmas a fundamentally merrier and relatable occasion. I mean, it sort of is, even from a religious perspective maybe?
[24/12/2022, 01:22:53] Alex Regueiro: Err, ignore the 'B'
[24/12/2022, 01:22:59] Alice Lafferty: But now it's become like a civic institute vaguely promoting 'spending time with family' or 'love' or something, which is, in its own way, kind of worse.
[24/12/2022, 01:23:28] Alex Regueiro: In what sense?
[24/12/2022, 01:23:45] Alex Regueiro: (worse)
[24/12/2022, 01:23:48] Alice Lafferty: Yea of course
[24/12/2022, 01:25:07] Alice Lafferty: Uh like turning images of families into aspirational lifestyle tat...
[24/12/2022, 01:25:19] Alice Lafferty: It feels like the bottom has fallen out a bit.
[24/12/2022, 01:25:51] Alice Lafferty: Like our family is gathered to celebrate the gathering of family... it lacks a proper object correlative.
[24/12/2022, 01:26:11] Alice Lafferty: Like 'the group worshipping itself'.
[24/12/2022, 01:26:22] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe I'm just finding reasons to be grinchy...
[24/12/2022, 01:26:39] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. I'm not sure 'aspirational' is quite right. In our crazy postmodern world where late-stage liberalism and the nuclear family are literally enemies...
[24/12/2022, 01:26:46] Alex Regueiro: But it does milk it for all it's worth
[24/12/2022, 01:26:59] Alex Regueiro: It's kind of cynical or hollow. So perhaps I part-agree with you.
[24/12/2022, 01:27:22] Alex Regueiro: When society overall doesn't really endorse "family" virtues
[24/12/2022, 01:27:38] Alice Lafferty: I would go as far as to say that family life probably shouldn't be displyed in advertising at all.
[24/12/2022, 01:27:43] Alex Regueiro: Not saying they're all-round superior to contemporary ones, though you know which way I lean at least...
[24/12/2022, 01:27:47] Alice Lafferty: But it does though. Our culture is highly sentimental.
[24/12/2022, 01:28:13] Alice Lafferty: It lacks the formal nuclear family figures but the big gloopy 'love everyone' stuff...
[24/12/2022, 01:28:38] Alex Regueiro: It's highly sentimental, yes. But I don't think that's particularly closely connected to family values or structures or anything
[24/12/2022, 01:28:42] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely
[24/12/2022, 01:28:58] Alex Regueiro: I'm with you there. Just don't make the same connection with the family per se.
[24/12/2022, 01:29:28] Alice Lafferty: It's just been redefined to accommodate 'blended families' or whatever
[24/12/2022, 01:29:32] Alex Regueiro: Why? That's a very radical liberal position, and look where that sort of idea has gotten us...
[24/12/2022, 01:30:00] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, how is it liberal?
[24/12/2022, 01:30:26] Alice Lafferty: I mean family life should be private, not because it's 'bad', but because it shouldn't be commercialised.
[24/12/2022, 01:30:29] Alex Regueiro: The idea that commercial activity and the market should be entirely disconnected from ethics or values.
[24/12/2022, 01:31:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh, I would never push for this to happen in real life, it's just a preference I hold
[24/12/2022, 01:31:26] Alex Regueiro: Sort of like secularism on steroids.
[24/12/2022, 01:31:52] Alex Regueiro: Full separation of 'church' and state doesn't work in practice. We've all seen the irony of Britain vs the US on that front!
[24/12/2022, 01:32:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh right I see
[24/12/2022, 01:32:57] Alice Lafferty: But muh pluralism.....
[24/12/2022, 01:33:09] Alex Regueiro: Maybe I read too much into your comment. This goes back to my comment about it being cynical/hollow. It's just business and the market manipulating people and ideas that have much more profound meaning to us. Sacred even.
[24/12/2022, 01:33:32] Alice Lafferty: This is exactly what I'm saying
[24/12/2022, 01:33:41] Alice Lafferty: And why it ought to be kept out of advertising really
[24/12/2022, 01:33:56] Alex Regueiro: In that case, damn Late Capitalism to hell!
[24/12/2022, 01:34:04] Alex Regueiro: ha
[24/12/2022, 01:34:10] Alice Lafferty: We prefer early-middle capitalism here
[24/12/2022, 01:35:16] Alex Regueiro: So do I. I still have a bit of dissonance over capitalism. Because I like a lot of it, and early-mid capitalism is quite appealing from what I know (although possibly looking at it through rose-tinted historical lens a bit).
[24/12/2022, 01:35:43] Alex Regueiro: At the same time, early capitalism kind of 'necessarily' led to late capitalism.
[24/12/2022, 01:35:54] Alex Regueiro: At least given other prevent socioeconomic factors and ideologies.
[24/12/2022, 01:36:09] Alex Regueiro: I think I'm being a historical materialist here...
[24/12/2022, 01:36:32] Alex Regueiro: or determinist at least
[24/12/2022, 01:37:30] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps we could have frozen ourselves in an earlier and more benign form of capitalism with other robust institutions (political, economic, and cultural) in place.
[24/12/2022, 01:37:32] Alice Lafferty: Marx would say that capitalism necessarily follows this path because it is predicated on expanding territory... eg. colonising more and more areas of life and/or actual physical land.
[24/12/2022, 01:37:54] Alice Lafferty: To be honest I don't know enough about its origins to really comment.
[24/12/2022, 01:38:12] Alex Regueiro: Yes. And liberal-capitalist ideologies like the free market (as wonderful as it is in some spheres) have inexorable tendencies to take over all facets of life.
[24/12/2022, 01:38:24] Alex Regueiro: Like interpersonal relationships, most nefariously, I would say
[24/12/2022, 01:38:47] Alex Regueiro: Nor do I. I'm just musing on generalities, mainly
[24/12/2022, 01:39:12] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I'm personally skeptical of this idea that there hasn't always been an economic motive behind most relationships. Even pre-capitalism.
[24/12/2022, 01:39:30] Alice Lafferty: When do you think this was?
[24/12/2022, 01:42:09] Alex Regueiro: Well there certainly has been. In fact there's far less economic motivation to pair up these days, at least from one perspective. But I meant a) relationships in a general sense (not just romance), b) contemporary dating culture has totally been captured by the free market and technology. It's literally like self-advertising yourself on a menu and having other people pick their favourite dish. That's fairly new.
[24/12/2022, 01:42:28] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, maybe late 18th C?
[24/12/2022, 01:43:03] Alice Lafferty: I agree about the encroachment of tech, but hasn't it always been a market of sorts?
[24/12/2022, 01:43:07] Alex Regueiro: Don't get me wrong, there were some nasty consequences of Victorian industrialism or even prior to this (East India Company?), but still... at least capitalistic ideas hadn't pervaded every aspect of life back then!
‚Äé[24/12/2022, 01:43:39] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[24/12/2022, 01:43:57] Alice Lafferty: How similar is this to a menu of options on a dating website.!
[24/12/2022, 01:44:02] Alex Regueiro: There's always been competition, but it was so small-scale in the past. Everyone is competing in much wider pools these days, with vastly more information at their fingertips, and tendencies to judge on whims and superficially (like with a food menu). All those things are new.
[24/12/2022, 01:44:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes, it hasn't scaled very well
[24/12/2022, 01:44:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, very similar. But of course... cherry-picked example, still small-scale, still probably only for high-status men, etc.
[24/12/2022, 01:44:51] Alice Lafferty: Cusp of the industrial revolution.
[24/12/2022, 01:44:55] Alex Regueiro: Right
[24/12/2022, 01:45:12] Alex Regueiro: That's only a semi-informed opinion though
[24/12/2022, 01:46:18] Alice Lafferty: Imo 'capitalism' is just the formalisation of social darwinism... I don't think there's anything unnatural about the profit motive.
[24/12/2022, 01:46:31] Alice Lafferty: It seems all so doomed to me..
[24/12/2022, 01:47:09] Alex Regueiro: In some ways yes. But that doesn't mean it evolves towards a stable system, let alone one of human flourishing (however you might define it)
[24/12/2022, 01:47:26] Alex Regueiro: Haha aren't we full of Christmas cheer? üôÇ
[24/12/2022, 01:47:36] Alice Lafferty: Yeah but dowries and brideprices have been a common institution for most of (western?) history
[24/12/2022, 01:48:00] Alice Lafferty: There's legitimately no such thing as human flourishing.
[24/12/2022, 01:48:13] Alice Lafferty: Lol, sorry
[24/12/2022, 01:48:43] Alice Lafferty: * no such thing as universal human flourishing.
[24/12/2022, 01:49:07] Alex Regueiro: Sort of. I'm not saying people chose based on love in the past. Quite the opposite. (And perhaps just as well.) But competition wasn't nearly so fierce and judgement so superficial, whatever you might say.
[24/12/2022, 01:49:22] Alex Regueiro: And I think in that sense at least, it was better for your average Joe & Jane.
[24/12/2022, 01:49:38] Alex Regueiro: Okay, phew... at least I can work with that comment ha
[24/12/2022, 01:50:06] Alex Regueiro: Nah it's fine. I'm contributing here. And excessive cheer is just inane and tedious anyway.
[24/12/2022, 01:50:09] Alice Lafferty: How do you know this?
[24/12/2022, 01:50:23] Alex Regueiro: I mean, history?
[24/12/2022, 01:50:30] Alex Regueiro: It's pretty well documented.
[24/12/2022, 01:50:46] Alice Lafferty: That competition was somehow less superficial?
[24/12/2022, 01:50:46] Alex Regueiro: And we can even talk to our grandparents and compare. As can past generations.
[24/12/2022, 01:50:57] Alex Regueiro: Judgement was.
[24/12/2022, 01:50:57] Alex Regueiro: Okay
[24/12/2022, 01:50:59] Alex Regueiro: So
[24/12/2022, 01:51:03] Alice Lafferty: It seemed really ruthlessly mercenary
[24/12/2022, 01:52:25] Alice Lafferty: I know that my grandmother got married pretty much out pragmatism. Just financial stability.
[24/12/2022, 01:52:28] Alex Regueiro: How can it be any worse than swift right/left? Most people's candidates in the past would be people from their own village whom they grew up with or at least knew reasonably well. Or from a neighbouring village at most. And in-person, you can't fob off someone so easily. There's almost forced confrontation, even with folks you don't like.
[24/12/2022, 01:52:35] Alex Regueiro: And that's a good thing to some extent
[24/12/2022, 01:52:49] Alex Regueiro: swipe right/left *
[24/12/2022, 01:53:11] Alice Lafferty: We've had reasonable national travel for quite a while now, but yes you're right that the scale is quite different.
[24/12/2022, 01:53:23] Alex Regueiro: For almost people and at almost points in history it was a combination of pragmatism and genuine affection.
[24/12/2022, 01:54:02] Alex Regueiro: Sure, but that's been continuously increasing, and the Internet revolutionised things yet again and brought people across the world into the same 'village', for better and for worse.
[24/12/2022, 01:54:29] Alice Lafferty: Yeah... people might have given a little more thought to decisions but barely. What is his salary/her cup size...? These kind of choices have always been 'superficial'.
[24/12/2022, 01:54:47] Alice Lafferty: Companionate marriages are the real historical outliers.
[24/12/2022, 01:55:04] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, but people simply couldn't afford to be half so picky
[24/12/2022, 01:55:11] Alice Lafferty: I'm highly doubtful that 'affection' ever came into it for even 1% of cases.
[24/12/2022, 01:55:11] Alex Regueiro: Not 1% so picky I daresay
[24/12/2022, 01:55:13] Alex Regueiro: at least for some
[24/12/2022, 01:55:53] Alex Regueiro: Please don't take this as an insult, but I think you're just a bit overly-cynical / jaundiced here. I used to be that way too.
[24/12/2022, 01:56:05] Alex Regueiro: I don't think there's any rational or empirical basis to belief that, at least
[24/12/2022, 01:56:28] Alex Regueiro: Even though cognitive biases might make it a very tempting view, given certain life experiences...
[24/12/2022, 01:56:32] Alice Lafferty: People haven't become more picky. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.19.484997v1.full
[24/12/2022, 01:56:50] Alice Lafferty: We have largely always chosen mates who are similar to us in terms of attractiveness, and that's still true.
[24/12/2022, 01:57:06] Alice Lafferty: I mean, this is true.
[24/12/2022, 01:57:09] Alex Regueiro: Fucking hell that's a long abstract
[24/12/2022, 01:57:13] Alex Regueiro: Let me read anyway...
[24/12/2022, 01:57:44] Alex Regueiro: Ironically the paper isn't that long haha
[24/12/2022, 01:57:51] Alice Lafferty: Wait I think I linked the wrong one
[24/12/2022, 01:57:56] Alex Regueiro: Okay üôÇ
[24/12/2022, 01:58:36] Alex Regueiro: We have, but I think it's pretty obvious the average man/woman couldn't afford to be nearly so picky in the past. Simply a consequence of pool size.
[24/12/2022, 01:58:42] Alice Lafferty: I think the majority of marriages that ever occurred were arranged between total strangers! (just pop. sizes of India and China)
[24/12/2022, 01:59:25] Alex Regueiro: The ability to judge hastily and superficiality is another matter, although it too has changed drastically.
[24/12/2022, 01:59:32] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure that's quite true
[24/12/2022, 01:59:51] Alice Lafferty: This is the one https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51184257_Out_of_My_League_A_Real-World_Test_of_the_Matching_Hypothesis
[24/12/2022, 02:00:10] Alex Regueiro: Although the couple may not have known each other well, I believe the usual case was that they were at least somewhat acquainted (had met a few times before) and that the wider families knew each other.
[24/12/2022, 02:01:07] Alex Regueiro: Yay, normal abstract!
[24/12/2022, 02:01:51] Alice Lafferty: Ok but if either of them had objected do their fiance, do you think anyone would have cared?
[24/12/2022, 02:01:55] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, is there actually a diachronic comparison here? Marginalising out other factors?
[24/12/2022, 02:02:31] Alex Regueiro: Well this very much depended on point in history, social class, personal circumstances, the personalities of the parents...
[24/12/2022, 02:02:32] Alice Lafferty: No, it's just modern day datingp
[24/12/2022, 02:02:59] Alex Regueiro: In some cases you would be right, but I honestly don't know whether it was typical. I'm doubtful, just because it's hard to imagine society functioning well that way.
[24/12/2022, 02:03:24] Alex Regueiro: And of course which culture we're talking about, even though there's lots of commonalities on some points
[24/12/2022, 02:03:30] Alice Lafferty: Exactly, marriage was a purely economic arrangement.
[24/12/2022, 02:04:07] Alex Regueiro: It was largely socioeconomic, but I refuse to believe it was entirely, especially among the lower and middle classes
[24/12/2022, 02:04:23] Alex Regueiro: (This is just an impression from reading history over the years.)
[24/12/2022, 02:05:13] Alice Lafferty: The lower classes have always been illiterate so we have hardly any access to their experiences and priorities.
[24/12/2022, 02:05:29] Alex Regueiro: BTW the abstract of that article seems eminently sensible to me.
[24/12/2022, 02:05:58] Alex Regueiro: It does some fence-sitting, but that's fair here
[24/12/2022, 02:06:42] Alice Lafferty: My impression from reading history is that even when romantic love is mentioned, its with fickleness and illusion as its most noteable characteristic.
[24/12/2022, 02:06:43] Alex Regueiro: Yes. And their prospects have usually been much poorer anyway. Hence the slight deemphasis of socioeconomic worth of a partner and slight emphasis on affection or (dare I say) love!
[24/12/2022, 02:07:19] Alice Lafferty: *emphasis on who you accidentally knocked up as a teenager and now have to marry to save face
[24/12/2022, 02:07:47] Alex Regueiro: Hah, that too. But would you knock someone up or get knocked up by someone you are not attracted to? üòâ
[24/12/2022, 02:08:08] Alice Lafferty: My totally unsupported hypothesis: >25% of marriages were shotgun weddings!
[24/12/2022, 02:08:28] Alice Lafferty: Maybe even >40-50%
[24/12/2022, 02:08:47] Alice Lafferty: Yeah but teenage boys are not really very discriminating there are they.
[24/12/2022, 02:09:19] Alice Lafferty: I mean pre-60s
[24/12/2022, 02:09:22] Alex Regueiro: It may have reached that high in certain contexts, yeah. But again, you can't infer there was no affection just from that. The old clich√© about "growing to love each other" must have a good deal of truth.
[24/12/2022, 02:10:06] Alex Regueiro: We're both doing a fair bit of conjecturing here to be honest. Not unreasonably, but surely based strongly on our own experiences and prejudices...
[24/12/2022, 02:10:29] Alice Lafferty: I guess the source I'm drawing from most on the lives of ordinary people is always Chaucer.. and most of his male characters spend most of their time bitching about how fat and old their wives are
[24/12/2022, 02:10:51] Alice Lafferty: Ha yes true
[24/12/2022, 02:11:32] Alice Lafferty: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loathly_lady
[24/12/2022, 02:11:51] Alice Lafferty: 'Love' isn't what springs to mind
[24/12/2022, 02:12:20] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's no doubt a common trope in literature (and art?) in history! Equally, it's hardly an impartial and multifaceted view. Chaucer was writing to entertain, as we know. There's a lot of humour in the Canterbury Tales.
[24/12/2022, 02:13:17] Alex Regueiro: There were surely common tropes that women entertained about men too (jokingly or seriously), which occasionally come out in history... I just wouldn't read too much into it.
[24/12/2022, 02:13:24] Alice Lafferty: Yeah ofc. Humour works because it hits upoj something true.
[24/12/2022, 02:13:26] Alice Lafferty: *upon
[24/12/2022, 02:13:38] Alex Regueiro: By their nature tropes tend to portray the most extreme attitudes, often transitory ones!
[24/12/2022, 02:13:59] Alex Regueiro: Right, but it's also inherently exaggerated.
[24/12/2022, 02:14:04] Alex Regueiro: and singled-out
[24/12/2022, 02:14:39] Alice Lafferty: They've had amazing survival into 20th c 'please take my wife' jokes.. it seems kind of fundamental to me
[24/12/2022, 02:14:52] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I guess
[24/12/2022, 02:14:57] Alex Regueiro: Yep. And some of these tropes may just represent fantasies!
[24/12/2022, 02:15:37] Alex Regueiro: Right, and it's still the sort of thing that men have banter about with their mates, that's for sure.
[24/12/2022, 02:16:05] Alice Lafferty: Exactly
[24/12/2022, 02:16:32] Alex Regueiro: And while I've not really been privy to it, women whining about their partners is clearly very common too, both seriously and in jest.
[24/12/2022, 02:17:09] Alice Lafferty: Definitely. They just haven't quite managed to make an institution out of it yet
[24/12/2022, 02:17:25] Alex Regueiro: That's the patriarchy, innit
[24/12/2022, 02:17:30] Alex Regueiro: Got a bit of catching up to do üòâ
[24/12/2022, 02:17:50] Alex Regueiro: You're on your way though, as a sex. üí™üèº
[24/12/2022, 02:18:15] Alice Lafferty: If it wasn't for the patriarchy we would have a thriving culture of 'men are trash' comedy bits.... oh wait
[24/12/2022, 02:18:29] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[24/12/2022, 02:18:35] Alex Regueiro: See
[24/12/2022, 02:18:38] Alex Regueiro: This is true equality
[24/12/2022, 02:18:54] Alex Regueiro: The sort feminists of the 50s must have been dreaming of!
[24/12/2022, 02:19:01] Alex Regueiro: What a marvellous world we now live in
[24/12/2022, 02:20:06] Alice Lafferty: üòï
[24/12/2022, 02:20:13] Alice Lafferty: I may have to go to bed
[24/12/2022, 02:20:31] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to go watch some Netflix and relax before bed in a minute too
[24/12/2022, 02:20:40] Alex Regueiro: Hopefully you're tired at least?
[24/12/2022, 02:20:44] Alice Lafferty: One day you and I WILL get to the bottom of capitalism as a phenomenon.
[24/12/2022, 02:20:51] Alex Regueiro: Don't want to sleep for Christmas Day now!
[24/12/2022, 02:21:19] Alice Lafferty: What are you watching?
[24/12/2022, 02:21:58] Alex Regueiro: We will. And we'll write a bestseller about it together, and reap the rewards of global advertising and the free market.
[24/12/2022, 02:22:22] Alice Lafferty: üëç$$
[24/12/2022, 02:22:43] Alex Regueiro: Some Japanese series about... err, it's a bit crazy, hard to explain
[24/12/2022, 02:22:45] Alex Regueiro: Alice in Borderland
[24/12/2022, 02:22:59] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok. Is this an anime
[24/12/2022, 02:23:02] Alex Regueiro: Nah
[24/12/2022, 02:23:10] Alice Lafferty: Good?
[24/12/2022, 02:23:58] Alex Regueiro: I've never actually watched anime, even though I have a few friends who keep trying to convince me to watch some of the classics, and insist I need to get over the stigma of all man-children and weirdos who make a cult out of it. üòõ
[24/12/2022, 02:24:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's not bad. I enjoyed season one, just starting the new season.
[24/12/2022, 02:24:22] Alice Lafferty: Me neither, and I've avoided it for this very same reason
[24/12/2022, 02:24:36] Alex Regueiro: There's a hint of Squid Game about it, though the premise is actually very different.
[24/12/2022, 02:24:54] Alice Lafferty: I didn't watch that one either..
[24/12/2022, 02:24:53] Alex Regueiro: Stigma and connotation is powerful, isn't it?
[24/12/2022, 02:25:06] Alex Regueiro: Well, let me know if you want me to give you Netflix recs üôÇ
[24/12/2022, 02:25:11] Alex Regueiro: I can start with better ones
[24/12/2022, 02:25:20] Alex Regueiro: (whenever)
[24/12/2022, 02:25:40] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Although maybe it's not crazy to infer stuff about a product from the people who consume it
[24/12/2022, 02:26:38] Alice Lafferty: I used to use it to rewatch episodes of Doctor Who and BBC Sherlock but they removed them.
[24/12/2022, 02:26:40] Alex Regueiro: This season is a bit more violent, but... I can just about tolerate it. I confess I find Korean and Japanese stuff kind of fascinating, just because their cultures and style of filmmaking are so different to ours
[24/12/2022, 02:26:58] Alice Lafferty: Tell me a good one?
[24/12/2022, 02:27:03] Alex Regueiro: Okay, they've been influenced by Western stuff of course, but still...
[24/12/2022, 02:27:19] Alex Regueiro: Plus, chance of being annoyed by woke bollocks is virtually nil.
[24/12/2022, 02:27:27] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I've picked up on that just from the ambient environment.
[24/12/2022, 02:27:27] Alex Regueiro: Along those lines? Hmm
[24/12/2022, 02:27:40] Alice Lafferty: Or just anything you thought was good.
[24/12/2022, 02:27:50] Alex Regueiro: I never really watched Doctor Who (actually just the two Cushing films from the 60s) but I did enjoy Sherlock (even if Cumberbatch is a prat).
[24/12/2022, 02:27:57] Alice Lafferty: Or even just watchable. It's fine to have something on in the background as like mental roughage.
[24/12/2022, 02:28:09] Alex Regueiro: Mental roughage. I like that ha
[24/12/2022, 02:28:42] Alice Lafferty: Haha I was heavily into it, largely because I was heavily into David Tennant.
[24/12/2022, 02:28:44] Alex Regueiro: Yes indeed, though I also tell myself there have been many great works of art enjoyed by brilliant and ghastly people alike.
[24/12/2022, 02:29:03] Alex Regueiro: Haha, one of your crushes you alluded to before?
[24/12/2022, 02:29:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes..
[24/12/2022, 02:30:32] Alice Lafferty: There's a few I tried, Succession, Ozark... I didn't really get into them though :(
[24/12/2022, 02:30:38] Alex Regueiro: Try Midnight Mass
[24/12/2022, 02:30:59] Alice Lafferty: Ok, thanks
[24/12/2022, 02:31:09] Alex Regueiro: It's good a slow burn, absorbing, and has a religious/theological theme to boot üòÄ
[24/12/2022, 02:31:12] Alex Regueiro: sure
[24/12/2022, 02:31:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I didn't get into those either... well, at least Ozark. My parents liked that
[24/12/2022, 02:31:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok thanks
[24/12/2022, 02:32:07] Alice Lafferty: Huh I already said that!
[24/12/2022, 02:32:19] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[24/12/2022, 02:32:23] Alex Regueiro: Wait what?
[24/12/2022, 02:32:44] Alice Lafferty: Blah I thanked you twice for recommending Midnight Mass.
[24/12/2022, 02:32:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok I am going to sleep now!
[24/12/2022, 02:33:00] Alex Regueiro: You're just such a good-mannered woman...
[24/12/2022, 02:33:07] Alex Regueiro: If you want to reaffirm all your ideas about how fucked up human relationships and sexuality can be, watch Black Butterflies (odd little French series)... but yeah, maybe not!
[24/12/2022, 02:33:31] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and I think you'd enjoy Ridley Scott's "The Terror" too. BBC series.
[24/12/2022, 02:34:10] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it was kind of fun at some level... but yeah, probably not something you want to watch right now ha
[24/12/2022, 02:34:32] Alex Regueiro: An endless supply of other recommendations, when you finish those (or decide you don't like them)...
[24/12/2022, 02:34:33] Alex Regueiro: Night!
[24/12/2022, 02:34:38] Alice Lafferty: I'll leave it until I'm feeling v gloomy around New Year
[24/12/2022, 02:34:49] Alice Lafferty: Night
[24/12/2022, 02:36:11] Alex Regueiro: The two I just recommend are actually darker, just... more wholesome, in some sense? üôÇ
[24/12/2022, 02:36:29] Alex Regueiro: Yes, New Year Blues... I'm looking forward to them too.
[24/12/2022, 20:41:35] Alice Lafferty: Season's grievings...
[24/12/2022, 20:42:53] Alice Lafferty: I'm joking, I'm in a very good mood now. Watching Home Alone and eating smoked salmon. Merry Christmas eve.
[24/12/2022, 20:43:03] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[24/12/2022, 20:43:30] Alex Regueiro: It's all good either way
[24/12/2022, 20:43:37] Alex Regueiro: Thank you, you too!
[24/12/2022, 20:45:09] Alex Regueiro: Otis and Mischa both look too clean, so I can't say "Merry Christmas you filthy animal" to anyone. üòî
[24/12/2022, 20:46:17] Alex Regueiro: Such a fun film though, and the sequel. Used to be a regular for me.
[24/12/2022, 20:46:30] Alex Regueiro: Keep an eye out for Donald if you watch #2!
[24/12/2022, 20:50:32] Alice Lafferty: Who is Mischa named after?
[24/12/2022, 20:50:46] Alice Lafferty: Or was it just a random choice
[24/12/2022, 20:50:56] Alice Lafferty: I think it's on TV tomorrow!
[24/12/2022, 20:52:22] Alex Regueiro: My sis named her way back in early 2009 when we got her. Then she abandoned her when she ran off to Argentina. Terrible.
[24/12/2022, 20:52:27] Alex Regueiro: I think she just liked the sound of the name
[24/12/2022, 20:53:29] Alex Regueiro: Might have heard it in Mischa Barton, I think? Not that she particularly followed her.
[24/12/2022, 20:54:04] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[24/12/2022, 20:54:17] Alice Lafferty: Yeah that's the only one I know
[24/12/2022, 20:54:37] Alex Regueiro: She's pretty but air-headed, so it kind of works, eh?
[24/12/2022, 20:55:08] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Super common in Russia/Ukraine but she's the only Westerner I can think of.
[24/12/2022, 22:27:57] Alex Regueiro: Speaking of names, Japanese renderings of Western name are kind of amusing. Like the series I mentioned last night. Your name is "Arisu" in it! And my name is "Arekusu", my Japanese friend once told me...
[24/12/2022, 22:29:33] Alex Regueiro: And that also reminds me... Merrii Kurisamisu! üòâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z9LpEKmz94
[25/12/2022, 10:20:46] Alice Lafferty: I actually really like that
[25/12/2022, 10:21:38] Alice Lafferty: „Ç¢„É™„Çπ Arisu
[25/12/2022, 10:22:27] Alice Lafferty: „Ç¢„É¨„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ Arekusu
[25/12/2022, 10:22:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha this is like the stereotypical thing with Asian people having trouble pronouncing "L"
[25/12/2022, 10:23:25] Alice Lafferty: „Ç™„Éº„ÉÜ„Ç£„Çπ Ootisu (Otis) üòë
[25/12/2022, 10:25:05] Alice Lafferty: Unholy clash of cultures
[25/12/2022, 10:26:47] Alice Lafferty: Wycliffe Bible: "In hym was lijf, and the lijf was the liyt of men; and the liyt schyneth in derknessis, and derknessis comprehendiden not it" (John 1:4-5) üôè
[25/12/2022, 13:48:58] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. And not putting two consonants in a row so having to insert a soft "u".
[25/12/2022, 13:49:04] Alex Regueiro: Verily!
[25/12/2022, 13:50:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that one doesn't work quite so well ha
[25/12/2022, 13:50:54] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, merry Christmas! And to your family. Hope you're having a lovely day. üòä
[25/12/2022, 17:33:20] Alice Lafferty: Thanks, you too
[25/12/2022, 18:37:18] Alex Regueiro: Did you get any nice gifts?
[27/12/2022, 08:53:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes, a trip to Switzerland in Feb...! And some books and stuff. I kind of don't enjoy the gift receiving aspect anymore because I'm conscious of the my parents still support me as an unemployed adult etc..
[27/12/2022, 08:53:22] Alice Lafferty: But it was very nice.
[27/12/2022, 08:53:25] Alice Lafferty: What did you get?
[27/12/2022, 16:10:03] Alex Regueiro: Ah lovely. Is this going to be your skiing holiday with the family then? I thought you were going early Jan, though maybe I remember wrong.
[27/12/2022, 16:10:38] Alex Regueiro: Any particularly interesting/cool books?
[27/12/2022, 16:10:50] Alex Regueiro: I got a nice ergonomic stand for my laptop
[27/12/2022, 16:11:03] Alex Regueiro: with a wireless keyboard
[27/12/2022, 16:11:58] Alex Regueiro: I asked for that (since I spend so much of my time there!)
[27/12/2022, 16:12:01] Alex Regueiro: A nice shirt too
[27/12/2022, 16:14:03] Alex Regueiro: That's very honourable of you, though I'm sure you worry too much and your parents don't really think of that way. The idea of leaving the home permanently at 18/19 is actually a very modern Anglocentric one. In the past children used to stay well into their 20s depending on the situation. Even longer in some cases, like if they were helping their father with his occupation. üôÇ
[27/12/2022, 16:14:46] Alex Regueiro: Plus, those Boomers sort of screwed the economy for us...
[28/12/2022, 07:00:12] Alice Lafferty: Why would you need a stand for a laptop? Doesn't it just go on your...lap (or desk)?
[28/12/2022, 07:00:49] Alice Lafferty: Or does it stop you having to hunch over?
[28/12/2022, 07:06:06] Alice Lafferty: Blah sorry we are going to France skiing in late Jan-Feb, then to Switzerland in June.
[28/12/2022, 07:07:22] Alice Lafferty: Lake Lucerne, specifically, as I've always wanted to go there. Switzerland's probably my favourite country in the world.
[28/12/2022, 07:07:58] Alice Lafferty: Right exactly, they should expect me to be contributing to the household income in some way..
[28/12/2022, 07:09:34] Alice Lafferty: Yeah. Although, I was kind of looking around and many parts of northern England seems quite affordable.
[28/12/2022, 07:10:20] Alice Lafferty: And you don't need a London tier salary or anything
[28/12/2022, 15:53:39] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes... it's for promoting good posture, and it's also essential when you have a standing desk (which is my plan when I move out)
[28/12/2022, 15:53:56] Alex Regueiro: Much more comfortable this way üôÇ
[28/12/2022, 15:54:02] Alex Regueiro: Ahh I see
[28/12/2022, 15:54:45] Alex Regueiro: Sounds nice
[28/12/2022, 15:56:06] Alex Regueiro: My mum has been wanting to go to Lake Lucerne for a while now.
[28/12/2022, 15:56:14] Alex Regueiro: Or was it Lake Konstanz? Honestly not sure
[28/12/2022, 15:57:13] Alex Regueiro: I've never been to Switzerland. I hear it's beautiful in many parts but also crazy-expensive and the people/culture are punctilious, to put it mildly.
[28/12/2022, 15:57:29] Alex Regueiro: Equally, I do love Roger Federer, so I need to visit. üôÇ
[28/12/2022, 15:58:14] Alex Regueiro: All in good time. You're better off investing in your future now through a good education and figuring out your path! Any more thoughts on that front?
[28/12/2022, 15:59:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Although it's not so pleasant in the industrial north. I was chatting with a guy at my friend's birthday party just before Christmas. He moved out to rural Hampshire for the sake of affordability and it was doing him quite nicely!
[28/12/2022, 15:59:41] Alex Regueiro: Concert tonight üéº
[28/12/2022, 21:32:28] Alice Lafferty: Probably a good idea
[28/12/2022, 21:32:44] Alice Lafferty: Sitting is the new smoking or whatever
[28/12/2022, 21:34:27] Alice Lafferty: I think for natural beauty per square mile, it is basically unparalleled. And yes it feels safe and well ordered for that reason
[28/12/2022, 21:36:15] Alice Lafferty: Is Hampshire affordable? I thought it basically underwent commuter-beltisation and hence super inflated house prices
[28/12/2022, 21:36:49] Alice Lafferty: True probably the nice parts of the north are expensive
[28/12/2022, 21:37:04] Alice Lafferty: Who, what, where!
[28/12/2022, 23:04:15] Alex Regueiro: When, why!
[28/12/2022, 23:04:32] Alex Regueiro: The Beethoven concert I told you about. üôÇ
[28/12/2022, 23:04:44] Alex Regueiro: The one you thought you couldn't make.
[28/12/2022, 23:04:57] Alex Regueiro: I went with my parents in the end. It was great, and very festive.
‚Äé[28/12/2022, 23:05:36] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[28/12/2022, 23:06:45] Alex Regueiro: Honestly that was my first thought too. Hampshire is too far out from London to be a commuter belt, but yeah, it's kind of ritzy in parts nonetheless. He must have found a good deal somewhere out in the sticks!
[28/12/2022, 23:07:23] Alex Regueiro: Heh, yes. Especially when you're as tall as me. It's working nicely! Oh, and standing desks are all the rage in Silicon Valley. At least last time I was there.
[28/12/2022, 23:08:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. They say the same about Singapore. No doubt it makes it nice for tourists. Not sure I'd want to live there but sounds like a lovely holiday.
[29/12/2022, 00:48:00] Alice Lafferty: Ah, sorry, I was misinformed by mum about when we were going away.
[29/12/2022, 00:48:23] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, no worries
[29/12/2022, 00:48:35] Alex Regueiro: That's happened to me before too!
[29/12/2022, 00:48:38] Alice Lafferty: Looks really nice, where was this?
[29/12/2022, 00:49:34] Alex Regueiro: Barbican
[29/12/2022, 00:50:08] Alice Lafferty: My great aunt lived in Geneva for a bit. They fine people for say, not clearing up dog mess.
[29/12/2022, 00:50:19] Alice Lafferty: And they actually follow up the fines
[29/12/2022, 00:51:19] Alice Lafferty: But I love that! I enjoy austerity and discreetness
[29/12/2022, 00:51:40] Alice Lafferty: What was Silicon Valley like?
[29/12/2022, 00:52:33] Alice Lafferty: Nice. Are you doing anything for New Year's?
[29/12/2022, 00:52:51] Alex Regueiro: I love that aspect too. Singapore does the same. I honestly think Britain would benefit from hefty fines for littering and leaving dog mess, for example. That would require police to actual patrol the streets though... fancy that!
[29/12/2022, 00:53:35] Alice Lafferty: Right, it would be one of those things they try and then never enforce.
[29/12/2022, 00:54:24] Alex Regueiro: I mean more like the pervading culture of narrow-mindedness and rule-following. I think the rules are great, the culture surrounding it less so. Maybe a few bad stories have biased me. Like neighbours reporting someone to the police for leaving clothes out to dry against some regulations...
[29/12/2022, 00:54:41] Alex Regueiro: Plus, the reputation of Swiss bankers haha
[29/12/2022, 00:54:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. It was lovely... everything except getting drenched walking there.
[29/12/2022, 00:55:04] Alice Lafferty: Yeees
[29/12/2022, 00:55:13] Alice Lafferty: I've heard about stuff like that as well
[29/12/2022, 00:55:29] Alice Lafferty: Did you know they have one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world
[29/12/2022, 00:55:38] Alice Lafferty: *some
[29/12/2022, 00:55:59] Alex Regueiro: Really interesting. I went ages ago (2012?) really. Saw Google HQ, which was cool. Though to be fair the standing desk was at my friend's start-up, when I visited a few years later.
[29/12/2022, 00:56:20] Alex Regueiro: You know, I'd heard that off hand once, and forgotten. Incredible really.
[29/12/2022, 00:56:21] Alice Lafferty: Wasn't 2012 like it's heyday?
[29/12/2022, 00:56:36] Alex Regueiro: Don't have a lot in common with gun-toting Bible-thumping Texans on the surface, but they you go...
[29/12/2022, 00:56:38] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe even earlier?
[29/12/2022, 00:56:51] Alex Regueiro: Yep, I'd say so. Or a few years earlier, but almost.
[29/12/2022, 00:57:17] Alice Lafferty: I know, it's kind of weird
[29/12/2022, 00:57:17] Alex Regueiro: The culture still felt reasonably free and dynamic, though it was starting to become "institutionalised" and "corporate" a little already
[29/12/2022, 00:57:40] Alice Lafferty: I wondered if it was some kind of statistical error or something
[29/12/2022, 00:57:55] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, now I want to check!
[29/12/2022, 00:58:44] Alex Regueiro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country
[29/12/2022, 00:58:46] Alex Regueiro: yep, pretty high
[29/12/2022, 00:59:05] Alice Lafferty: I think it's a case study used by pro-gun Americans a lot.
[29/12/2022, 00:59:22] Alice Lafferty: Like, 'see, the guns are not the problem'
[29/12/2022, 00:59:48] Alex Regueiro: Haha Falkland Islands. Need to sleep with one eye open and your gun cocked when your neighbours are Argies!
[29/12/2022, 01:00:34] Alex Regueiro: Funny how so many decent, well-run, "civilised" countries are near the top of that list. I mean, countries often cited as such. Finland, Iceland, Norway, Uruguay, New Zealand...
[29/12/2022, 01:00:43] Alex Regueiro: and of course Switzerland
[29/12/2022, 01:00:50] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see. Am I correct in saying lots of the tech industry has upped sticks to Miami or is that a meme I naively believed?
[29/12/2022, 01:01:00] Alice Lafferty: Exactly..
[29/12/2022, 01:01:31] Alice Lafferty: I associate Switzerland with Scandinavia in my head for some reason
[29/12/2022, 01:02:05] Alex Regueiro: I haven't heard that, but it sounds plausible enough! Florida has liberal tax laws. It may just be where they're officially registered. Silicon Valley still seems to be the centre of everything, even if its culture has gone completely ga-ga these days.
[29/12/2022, 01:02:18] Alice Lafferty: I'd usually be reluctant to say something like this but it does seem the problem in the US is largely cultural.
[29/12/2022, 01:02:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, some similar traits for sure. And maybe because some people love to confuse Switzerland and Sweden. Not you though, I'm quite sure! üôÇ
[29/12/2022, 01:02:58] Alice Lafferty: Yeah. It must be/have been exciting there!
[29/12/2022, 01:03:06] Alex Regueiro: With guns or Silicon Valley? My reply in either case is: yes.
[29/12/2022, 01:03:26] Alex Regueiro: Opposite ends of the scale, but both diseased cultures, I would say
[29/12/2022, 01:03:30] Alice Lafferty: California literally won so many lotteries
[29/12/2022, 01:03:49] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I keep accidentally replying to my own messages with a prayer emoji (?)
[29/12/2022, 01:04:04] Alice Lafferty: Haha yeah
[29/12/2022, 01:04:22] Alex Regueiro: Haha. Christmas must worked you into a religious fervour.
[29/12/2022, 01:04:47] Alice Lafferty: Did you go to any kind of service on Christmas day?
[29/12/2022, 01:04:48] Alex Regueiro: Lotteries as in... best of multiple worlds?
[29/12/2022, 01:05:09] Alex Regueiro: It is... though I get the feeling that's all in the past now. Tends to be the worst of multiple worlds these days.

[29/12/2022, 01:05:50] Alice Lafferty: *I mean, geographically, the frontiersmen, the gold rush, the climate,

[29/12/2022, 01:06:08] Alex Regueiro: Nope. Did you? Last time I did something like that was maybe midnight mass at Westminster Cathedral 8 years ago or so...
[29/12/2022, 01:06:19] Alice Lafferty: Ah that must have been so nice!
[29/12/2022, 01:06:31] Alice Lafferty: Yes I went to midnight mass.
[29/12/2022, 01:06:45] Alice Lafferty: Oh speaking of which I was going to watch 'Midnight Mass'
[29/12/2022, 01:07:11] Alex Regueiro: And in answer to your previous: no plans for NYE. Was busy tonight, and tomorrow and the next day, but will probably be bringing the New Year in (recent) customary style at home by myself.
[29/12/2022, 01:07:57] Alice Lafferty: Ok, but your parents will be there too?
[29/12/2022, 01:08:05] Alex Regueiro: Yep. It's pretty much always been a den of iniquity, though these days it's superficially puritanical (i.e. immensely hypocritical) to boot. And the rest of LA isn't much better heh.
[29/12/2022, 01:09:01] Alice Lafferty: Same anyway. The pressure of NYE is too much, this is a cliche which bears repeating.
[29/12/2022, 01:09:05] Alex Regueiro: Please do! It's a well-made atmospheric horror-drama story, which builds nicely. Very little gore though if I recall. Hope that fits the bill for you.
[29/12/2022, 01:09:29] Alice Lafferty: Yeah sounds perfectüëå
[29/12/2022, 01:09:47] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, they often have friends round, so if I show my face at all it's just briefly before I retreat, in search of blissful time to myself...
[29/12/2022, 01:09:49] Alex Regueiro: How about you?
[29/12/2022, 01:10:36] Alex Regueiro: And yeah it was great. I mean, long tedious masses were the bane of my childhood, but this was kind of fun. My parents even met the priest who married them, he was still there! They really liked him,
[29/12/2022, 01:10:53] Alice Lafferty: Haha, same. And no, I'm not doing anything either.
[29/12/2022, 01:11:15] Alice Lafferty: It causes quite strong negative emotions for me but I can't really identify why.
[29/12/2022, 01:11:39] Alice Lafferty: Just superstition and ""fomo"" probably
[29/12/2022, 01:13:07] Alex Regueiro: Yep. NYE and LA are totally distinct (apart from being large American cities), but both are decidedly unliveable, indeed. NY was at least nice to visit on holiday, whereas I didn't care much for LA even to look at. (I have some good stories from my trip, mind you!)
[29/12/2022, 01:13:12] Alex Regueiro: SF was a cool place, before the homeless problem spiralled even more out of control than it used to be, and the yuppies got all woke eh.
[29/12/2022, 01:13:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I totally get that
[29/12/2022, 01:13:36] Alice Lafferty: That's sweet, I guess they don't move them around some much in such a large parish
[29/12/2022, 01:13:51] Alice Lafferty: Haha I meant New Years Eve not New York City!
[29/12/2022, 01:14:34] Alex Regueiro: I used to have FOMO as would one or two friends, and two or three times we thought we'd go into London. Invariably regretted it terribly. The last time we finally got the hint and turned back around Mile End haha.
[29/12/2022, 01:14:54] Alice Lafferty: I think I've been to both but I was very young. SF is pretty, I was totally unaware of its like economic significance
[29/12/2022, 01:14:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I was kind of surprised at too, but it's one of the few careers for life left now, isn't it?
[29/12/2022, 01:15:18] Alex Regueiro: Haha man my brain really malfunctioned there
[29/12/2022, 01:15:41] Alex Regueiro: We were just talking about LA so I associated "NY" with NYC and ignored the E. üòÇ
[29/12/2022, 01:15:44] Alice Lafferty: Yeah exactly, it's only fun, theoretically
[29/12/2022, 01:15:50] Alice Lafferty: But not in actuality
[29/12/2022, 01:16:10] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's fine!
[29/12/2022, 01:16:19] Alex Regueiro: Yep. The lifestyle there is much nicer than LA/NYC though.
[29/12/2022, 01:16:35] Alex Regueiro: Precisely
[29/12/2022, 01:16:56] Alice Lafferty: Apparently there were only 42 noviciates in 2021.
[29/12/2022, 01:17:08] Alice Lafferty: I imagine the number is a bit higher for the priesthood but still
[29/12/2022, 01:17:13] Alice Lafferty: Or it was something like that anyway
[29/12/2022, 01:17:20] Alex Regueiro: Like so many rituals of modern life, I'd say.
[29/12/2022, 01:17:33] Alex Regueiro: Satan's temptations! üòâ
[29/12/2022, 01:17:48] Alex Regueiro: interesting. That's extremely low.
[29/12/2022, 01:18:09] Alex Regueiro: CoE I presume you mean?
[29/12/2022, 01:19:19] Alice Lafferty: This is like more broadly that satisfaction kills desire.
[29/12/2022, 01:19:21] Alice Lafferty: I'm reading Lacanüòâ
[29/12/2022, 01:19:44] Alice Lafferty: I actually don't know where I read that statistic
[29/12/2022, 01:19:52] Alice Lafferty: It probably is just CofE yeah
‚Äé[29/12/2022, 01:20:42] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[29/12/2022, 01:20:43] Alice Lafferty: If things do not turn around in 2023, I am joining a covent. A silent order to be specific
[29/12/2022, 01:20:54] Alice Lafferty: *convent! üò≥
[29/12/2022, 01:21:20] Alex Regueiro: Haha wouldn't blame you
[29/12/2022, 01:21:28] Alex Regueiro: Well, a coven might be more fun to be fair!
[29/12/2022, 01:21:51] Alice Lafferty: Exactly!
[29/12/2022, 01:22:13] Alice Lafferty: Do you still do resolutions or have you outgrown that?
[29/12/2022, 01:22:14] Alex Regueiro: A CoE priest used to be on the same quiz team as me. Strange fellow. I mean, eccentric and socially a little clueless, but fundamentally very nice.
[29/12/2022, 01:22:19] Alex Regueiro: Recent initiate.
[29/12/2022, 01:22:31] Alice Lafferty: You have to be a little odd to join the clergy in the 21st century.
[29/12/2022, 01:23:03] Alex Regueiro: The brother of a good Italian friend of mine is now a Catholic priest too. Come to think of it, I knew more than my fair share of priests...
[29/12/2022, 01:23:08] Alex Regueiro: of varying ages
[29/12/2022, 01:23:37] Alex Regueiro: Most certainly. Though I can't say a small part of me doesn't sympathise with them. Not nearly enough to join, but you know...
[29/12/2022, 01:23:45] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, I wonder what the congregation numbers are like in Italy
[29/12/2022, 01:23:56] Alice Lafferty: Probably a bit higher than here but dwindling all the same
[29/12/2022, 01:24:03] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure I ever did. Err, maybe twice actually. Not in ages. ü´¢ You?
[29/12/2022, 01:24:17] Alice Lafferty: I would guess an older average age than the UK as well.
[29/12/2022, 01:24:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I get the feeling they're on the same curve, just a bit behind. Same goes with Spain and Poland, the latter being the most religious country in Europe I think?
[29/12/2022, 01:25:01] Alex Regueiro: FYI I hear they have a streamlined programme for Oxbridge theology dropouts. üòÄ
[29/12/2022, 01:25:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes same. And CofE is more understandable.
[29/12/2022, 01:25:22] Alex Regueiro: You just have to repudiate Lacan. He's one of the many manifestations of Beelzebub.
[29/12/2022, 01:25:38] Alice Lafferty: It's the total renunciation of all kind of relationships and family life which attracts only peculiar types to Catholic priesthood.
[29/12/2022, 01:26:04] Alice Lafferty: Very funny..
[29/12/2022, 01:26:20] Alex Regueiro: From a lifestyle perspective, definitely. From other points of view... I mean, it's so watered down and insipid now, it's kind of pathetic.
[29/12/2022, 01:26:53] Alice Lafferty: In all seriousness I could join Ridley Hall.
[29/12/2022, 01:27:11] Alice Lafferty: Or there are seminaries in Oxford right? Permanent private halls?
[29/12/2022, 01:27:15] Alex Regueiro: I honestly don't anything about him really, except everyone I respect considered him an utter charlatan. He half-learnt a bit of maths (to put it kindly) and used this to superficially lend support to some wacky sociological theories.
[29/12/2022, 01:27:29] Alice Lafferty: I'm pretty sure there's an evangelical Wycliffe sect there but you can correct me on that
[29/12/2022, 01:27:47] Alex Regueiro: There are still religious colleges left there. (Unlike Cambridge?) One of them actually hosted a decent bop hah.
[29/12/2022, 01:27:54] Alice Lafferty: Yeah... it's basically a civic institute for the accommodation of religious sentiment.
[29/12/2022, 01:28:32] Alice Lafferty: I don't really understand it well enough yet to comment..
[29/12/2022, 01:29:07] Alice Lafferty: Probably. Like what is 'petit objet a', give me a break
[29/12/2022, 01:29:08] Alex Regueiro: That's almost cool. I mean, there's few things more "based" than joining an evangelical Wycliffe sect in Oxford in the 21st C.
[29/12/2022, 01:29:45] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[29/12/2022, 01:30:00] Alice Lafferty: I feel like a book was written by a group of angry mathematicians about this.
[29/12/2022, 01:30:08] Alice Lafferty: People like Julia Kristeva were v guilty of it too.
[29/12/2022, 01:30:10] Alex Regueiro: Bold of you to assume you will ever understand such gibberish.
[29/12/2022, 01:30:31] Alice Lafferty: No, Cambridge has one, Ridley Hall
[29/12/2022, 01:30:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh right
[29/12/2022, 01:30:41] Alex Regueiro: Yes
[29/12/2022, 01:30:45] Alex Regueiro: I think Oxford has more though?
[29/12/2022, 01:31:27] Alice Lafferty: I'm afraid of the word 'based' these days..
[29/12/2022, 01:31:38] Alice Lafferty: I think so, yeah.
[29/12/2022, 01:31:49] Alex Regueiro: French postmodernists have a strong tendency towards arrant claptrap. Lacan just happens to be the worst of them. But reading or listening to Foucault is enough to give anyone religion.
[29/12/2022, 01:32:02] Alex Regueiro: Even Sartre is a bit annoying
[29/12/2022, 01:32:11] Alice Lafferty: * guess you know about the Sokal affair
[29/12/2022, 01:32:24] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I know... I use it semi-ironically. üôÇ
[29/12/2022, 01:33:01] Alice Lafferty: Yeah there's a reason the existentialism is 'baby's first philosophy' for edgy 13 year olds.
[29/12/2022, 01:33:02] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, and Sokal squared. That's more in response to modern critical-theory-derived output, but still wonderful. I love those guys.
[29/12/2022, 01:33:38] Alice Lafferty: Same! I used to follow Helen Pluckrose on twitter
[29/12/2022, 01:33:39] Alex Regueiro: If you're going to do existentialism, it should at least be the sort espoused by Kierkegaard. Far edgier!
[29/12/2022, 01:33:59] Alice Lafferty: But have you seem what James Lindsay has been up to recently... he's got major brainworms
[29/12/2022, 01:34:14] Alex Regueiro: Noo, tell me
[29/12/2022, 01:34:16] Alice Lafferty: Very funny
[29/12/2022, 01:34:40] Alex Regueiro: She's good. I haven't read her stuff, but I saw a long interview with her once, and enjoyed it.
[29/12/2022, 01:35:21] Alice Lafferty: Literally frenzied 'post-modern neo-marxists' baiter, posting pictures of concentration camps implying white people will be sent there etc...
[29/12/2022, 01:35:28] Alice Lafferty: Just look at his twitter
[29/12/2022, 01:36:17] Alex Regueiro: "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity"
[29/12/2022, 01:36:36] Alex Regueiro: Oh no. Even JP hasn't gone that far.
[29/12/2022, 01:37:00] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I would love to read some of the full papers that got published!
[29/12/2022, 01:37:15] Alice Lafferty: He's heading that way
[29/12/2022, 01:37:56] Alice Lafferty: I saw the greatest minds of my generation etc... The key is to become memetically immune.
[29/12/2022, 01:38:09] Alex Regueiro: Ah he's one of the recently reinstated accounts
[29/12/2022, 01:38:23] Alex Regueiro: It is. I think a lot of that is intrinsic though.
[29/12/2022, 01:38:25] Alice Lafferty: This is my 2023 resolution.
[29/12/2022, 01:38:38] Alex Regueiro: to one's personality and psyche, that is
[29/12/2022, 01:38:58] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps why I've never particularly enjoyed sharing memes... or at least never really followed them, and other fads
[29/12/2022, 01:39:12] Alice Lafferty: Huh at least partially, but I think it can be taught to a certain extent.
[29/12/2022, 01:39:16] Alex Regueiro: As good a one as any!
[29/12/2022, 01:39:57] Alice Lafferty: Just, emphatically, there are no wholly correct frameworks or worldviews.
[29/12/2022, 01:40:08] Alex Regueiro: BTW, speaking of grievance studies and all that... the wonderful Kurt Vonnegut made this comment, many decades ago.
[29/12/2022, 01:40:18] Alex Regueiro: (Of Allen Ginsburg)
[29/12/2022, 01:40:21] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄúI like ‚ÄúHowl‚Äù a lot. Who wouldn‚Äôt? It just doesn‚Äôt have much to do with me or what happened to my friends. For one thing, I believe that the best minds of my generation were probably musicians and physicists and mathematicians and biologists and archaeologists and chess masters and so on, and Ginsberg‚Äôs closest friends, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, were undergraduates in the English department of Columbia University. No offense intended, but it would never occur to me to look for the best minds in any generation in an undergraduate English department anywhere. I would certainly try the physics department or the music department first ‚Äî and after that biochemistry. Everybody knows that the dumbest people in any American university are in the education department, and English after that.‚Äù
[29/12/2022, 01:40:24] Alice Lafferty: And constant vigilance towards group dynamics
[29/12/2022, 01:40:26] Alex Regueiro: I just read that the other day üôÇ
[29/12/2022, 01:40:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. This is the bit of postmodernism that is actually valid/useful. Alas, it takes it too far...
[29/12/2022, 01:40:56] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I love Vonnegut
[29/12/2022, 01:41:18] Alice Lafferty: And true, Allen Ginsburg was a fake and a pedophile.
[29/12/2022, 01:41:29] Alex Regueiro: I honestly think you're one of the people who needs to worry about that least, but I still commend the effort. We should always keep our guard up to such influences.
[29/12/2022, 01:41:37] Alex Regueiro: Sounds a bit like Foucault...
[29/12/2022, 01:42:04] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, all their signatures are on that one petition, you know
[29/12/2022, 01:42:34] Alex Regueiro: I didn't know Ginsburg was, but yeah... the one to remove the age of consent right?
[29/12/2022, 01:42:53] Alex Regueiro: His doctoral thesis is titled "Combinatorial Unification of Binomial-Like Arrays", and his advisor was Carl G. Wagner.[5] After completing his degree, Lindsay left academia and returned to his hometown, where he worked as a massage therapist.[6] üòÇ
[29/12/2022, 01:42:56] Alex Regueiro: (Lindsay)
[29/12/2022, 01:43:03] Alice Lafferty: I don't think anyone's immune
[29/12/2022, 01:43:27] Alice Lafferty: I'm probably just embedded in a hierarchy which rewards contrariness.
[29/12/2022, 01:43:31] Alex Regueiro: Certainly not. But some are inherently more resistant (or conversely, susceptible to peer pressure and groupthink, etc.)
[29/12/2022, 01:43:46] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[29/12/2022, 01:43:57] Alice Lafferty: Pft, he's an interesting fellow
[29/12/2022, 01:44:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I honestly don't care if he's 'batshit insane', he sounds fun.
[29/12/2022, 01:44:31] Alex Regueiro: Mathematician too üëç
[29/12/2022, 01:44:46] Alice Lafferty: The really interesting thing is when contrarianism becomes a social norm, itself
[29/12/2022, 01:45:47] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I was surprised by how he developed
[29/12/2022, 01:46:11] Alex Regueiro: That's not a genuine paradox? I'll need to ponder it...
[29/12/2022, 01:46:52] Alice Lafferty: * I mean contrarianism mainstream norms. So you have two parallel social groups.
[29/12/2022, 01:47:01] Alice Lafferty: *to
[29/12/2022, 01:47:30] Alice Lafferty: Which is what the ""dissident right"" has become unfortunately!
[29/12/2022, 01:47:43] Alex Regueiro: I just looked and his timeline and to be fair his points looked *in essence* mainly valid, only stated in the most hyperbolic and hysterical way possible. üòõ But hey, if a president got elected by trolling people, why can't he do it?
[29/12/2022, 01:47:52] Alex Regueiro: Ah right
[29/12/2022, 01:47:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah...
[29/12/2022, 01:48:16] Alice Lafferty: Yeah hysterical is exactly the right word
[29/12/2022, 01:48:33] Alice Lafferty: And tbf I unfollowed him a while ago so I don't know what he's up to now
[29/12/2022, 01:48:47] Alex Regueiro: Read a somewhat interesting article today about how conservatism has become for all intents and purposes pathologised over recent decades.
[29/12/2022, 01:49:19] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair. Well his recent timeline does fit that bill, but... nothing too egregious in itself.
[29/12/2022, 01:49:20] Alice Lafferty: Hm?
[29/12/2022, 01:49:27] Alex Regueiro: by Furedi
[29/12/2022, 01:49:40] Alice Lafferty: I suppose, conservative sexual norms are pathologised yes
[29/12/2022, 01:49:40] Alex Regueiro: Sokal and Pluckrose are still sound though, from what I can tell. üôÇ
[29/12/2022, 01:49:47] Alex Regueiro: No no, far beyond that
[29/12/2022, 01:49:49] Alex Regueiro: one sec
[29/12/2022, 01:50:04] Alice Lafferty: But I don't see that for other forms of conservatism
[29/12/2022, 01:50:19] Alice Lafferty: Yesüëç
[29/12/2022, 01:51:36] Alex Regueiro: Just conservative attitudes in general
[29/12/2022, 01:51:40] Alex Regueiro: towards pretty much anything
[29/12/2022, 01:51:58] Alex Regueiro: https://frankfuredi.substack.com/p/the-age-of-anxiety-and-the-medicalisation
[29/12/2022, 01:52:28] Alex Regueiro: I also like how he's started using Dall-E generated images to illustrate his articles heh.
‚Äé[29/12/2022, 01:52:39] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/12/2022, 01:53:38] Alice Lafferty: This seems sus to me
[29/12/2022, 01:53:48] Alice Lafferty: That's not normally how chatGPT-3 responds
[29/12/2022, 01:54:22] Alice Lafferty: It normally says: "as a large language model...". It never makes meta-references to its own 'programming'
[29/12/2022, 01:54:50] Alex Regueiro: Interesting
[29/12/2022, 01:54:52] Alex Regueiro: Let's test it out
[29/12/2022, 01:56:44] Alice Lafferty: Huh, tbf it gave quite a similar answer
[29/12/2022, 01:56:51] Alex Regueiro: Anyway enjoy Frank Furedi's Dall-E illustrated article. He's written a few other good ones recently.
[29/12/2022, 01:56:58] Alex Regueiro: Aha!
‚Äé[29/12/2022, 01:57:13] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/12/2022, 01:57:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Might be legit then?
[29/12/2022, 01:57:31] Alex Regueiro: Funny
[29/12/2022, 01:57:32] Alice Lafferty: But still a bit different... I'm not sure
[29/12/2022, 01:57:43] Alice Lafferty: Ok thanks I will read it
[29/12/2022, 01:58:02] Alex Regueiro: It's not hugely in-depth, but he's usually good to read I find. üôÇ
[29/12/2022, 01:58:43] Alex Regueiro: The recent one on why Western elites are so incompetent these days is also excellent.
[29/12/2022, 02:00:53] Alice Lafferty: I just kind of skimmed it but yeah, he's right, particularly about trying to quantify emotions. Like 'love', 'friendship', 'happiness', 'meaningfulness' get collapsed back into biological processes.
[29/12/2022, 02:00:59] Alex Regueiro: It's one of those things that's both very believable and kind of shocking. I mean, it's at least indicative of the social enforcement and (self) censorship relating to some narratives.
[29/12/2022, 02:01:37] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. That's really not fruitful at a biological level. We have to "embrace the phenomenal side"!
[29/12/2022, 02:01:56] Alex Regueiro: Or phenomenological... Even I don't fully get the difference
[29/12/2022, 02:02:07] Alice Lafferty: But to be honest the right is guilty of this too. They are still operating under the same framework, like: studies show that career provides 1 Unit of Meaning but 1 x baby provides 5 meanings. Not as much as 3 x baby, which provides 10 meaning.
[29/12/2022, 02:02:33] Alice Lafferty: Me neither :s
[29/12/2022, 02:03:29] Alice Lafferty: I'm glad that he also noted that loneliness and alienation have been a pretty much ubiquitous feature of human life throughout history.
[29/12/2022, 02:03:35] Alex Regueiro: I think it's largely historical.
[29/12/2022, 02:03:58] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever read Gadamer by the way?
[29/12/2022, 02:04:20] Alice Lafferty: I think his 'truth without method' could be kind of applicable here.
[29/12/2022, 02:04:32] Alex Regueiro: I think this was more prominent in the past discourse of the right, but yes. Now, since they've lost virtually all sociocultural power...
[29/12/2022, 02:04:39] Alex Regueiro: No, but sounds interesting
[29/12/2022, 02:05:08] Alice Lafferty: Haha I totally disagree with you here! I think the right have been ascendant since ~2020.
[29/12/2022, 02:05:32] Alex Regueiro: Haha what?! The left have literally 100% captured all the institutions.
[29/12/2022, 02:05:50] Alex Regueiro: Civil service, media, arts, HR departments, most board members...
[29/12/2022, 02:05:58] Alex Regueiro: Gramsci is partying in the afterlife
[29/12/2022, 02:05:59] Alex Regueiro: surely
[29/12/2022, 02:06:16] Alice Lafferty: Basically he argued that meaning and understanding are not objects to be found through certain methods, but are inevitable phenomena.
[29/12/2022, 02:06:50] Alice Lafferty: It lives on in university lecture rooms and HR departments but it has no vitality.
[29/12/2022, 02:06:56] Alice Lafferty: It's not a living culture anymore.
[29/12/2022, 02:07:52] Alice Lafferty: He was a student of Heidegger. I like what I've read of him but haven't committed yet.
[29/12/2022, 02:08:32] Alex Regueiro: That's a different matter. It lost vitality because it effectively won in the public sphere. It achieved all its goals. The reverse march through the institutions, if that even happens, is only just beginning.
[29/12/2022, 02:08:35] Alex Regueiro: And there's a long road ahead
[29/12/2022, 02:08:40] Alice Lafferty: I'm thinking now of your disdain for continental philosophy...
[29/12/2022, 02:08:55] Alex Regueiro: I've never really looked into Heidegger (hey, phenomenology), but he doesn't appeal much to me.
[29/12/2022, 02:08:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[29/12/2022, 02:09:06] Alex Regueiro: With a few exceptions that disdain is still alive and kicking.
[29/12/2022, 02:09:26] Alex Regueiro: Equally, I'm not a far of the excesses of the analytic school, at least in terms of "rationalising everything away".
[29/12/2022, 02:13:10] Alice Lafferty: Wait sorry I'm just looking for something...
[29/12/2022, 02:13:16] Alex Regueiro: Sure
[29/12/2022, 02:13:48] Alex Regueiro: BTW I got exactly this resposne! It's genuine. üòí
‚Äé[29/12/2022, 02:14:03] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/12/2022, 02:14:44] Alice Lafferty: ü§î
[29/12/2022, 02:15:27] Alice Lafferty: But in all seriousness continental philosophy doesn't really hold a candle to analytic EXCEPT when it comes to phenomenology.
[29/12/2022, 02:16:57] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah. That's actually quite true.
[29/12/2022, 02:17:29] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it does logic a terrible disservice, but since it's a meme... yeah, it's got a point.
[29/12/2022, 02:18:15] Alex Regueiro: I've never really studied phenomenology, but I can imagine that's true yeah
[29/12/2022, 02:18:19] Alice Lafferty: It does kind of make it seem built on sand
[29/12/2022, 02:18:35] Alice Lafferty: At that point, the only place to go is basically inwards
[29/12/2022, 02:18:46] Alex Regueiro: I would also say analytic philosophy has little to nothing to say about how to life your life. The continental school at least has more to say about that, both good and bad takes.
[29/12/2022, 02:18:54] Alice Lafferty: I think Heidegger is fairly rigorous (apparently) so maybe you should give him a go?
[29/12/2022, 02:19:18] Alex Regueiro: Wait, what are you referring to exactly here?
[29/12/2022, 02:19:33] Alice Lafferty: Plus he's more strictly a metaphysicist and doesn't make so many silly comments about ""society"" or whatever
[29/12/2022, 02:19:55] Alice Lafferty: Yes, exactly, you can't derive values from it.
[29/12/2022, 02:20:09] Alice Lafferty: That logic has no empirical foundation
[29/12/2022, 02:20:52] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. He and Husserl are probably near the top of the continental philosophers I plan to read at some point. Both phenomenologists of course. The former taught Arendt and the latter was educated as a mathematician, so what can go wrong eh?
[29/12/2022, 02:21:07] Alice Lafferty: I also think he's half-wrong, you can 'observe' causality to a certain extent in experimental conditions.
[29/12/2022, 02:21:10] Alex Regueiro: I hate "pure" metaphysics, but depending on his approach, that's tolerable.
[29/12/2022, 02:21:23] Alex Regueiro: Right. Hume knew...
[29/12/2022, 02:21:29] Alice Lafferty: It's the 'entail' part that is problematic
[29/12/2022, 02:21:43] Alice Lafferty: Yeah exactly
[29/12/2022, 02:21:51] Alice Lafferty: I haven't read Husserl either
‚Äé[29/12/2022, 02:23:24] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[29/12/2022, 02:23:55] Alex Regueiro: Good, that's what I thought. Indeed, I've grappled with this matter over years, and come to the conclusion that pragmatism (in various ways) is the only satisfying escape. First, we have to accept that our conception of "necessary" statements is intrinsically linked to our psychology, and that we cannot conceive of things any other way (I mean, we can't conceive of modus ponens being invalid, for example). But also this intuition we have serves us so well in our experiences and all intellectual endeavour, so why worry about it? In fact, empiricism can be argued to back up logic, albeit very indirectly.
[29/12/2022, 02:24:34] Alice Lafferty: Ah haha I was literally just talking to this guy who claimed he had bridged the is-ought gap, but he wouldn't tell me how because he was saving his revelation for publication.
[29/12/2022, 02:24:46] Alex Regueiro: I don't know whether to laugh or cry for him.
[29/12/2022, 02:24:58] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I know your position on it.
[29/12/2022, 02:25:07] Alice Lafferty: I kind of agree.
[29/12/2022, 02:25:18] Alex Regueiro: Maybe he work at a massage parlour and take inspiration from James Lindsay!
[29/12/2022, 02:25:29] Alice Lafferty: We should call something true to the extent that it has good predictive power.
[29/12/2022, 02:25:45] Alex Regueiro: Hey... In 10 years, you can be a famous right-wing Twitter troll!
[29/12/2022, 02:26:14] Alex Regueiro: Yes. That's truth in the scientific (and some other) contexts. And there are similar pragmatic justifications for other epistemological domains.
[29/12/2022, 02:26:23] Alice Lafferty: Noo in 10 years time the twitter trolls will be lefties, you see
[29/12/2022, 02:26:46] Alex Regueiro: Haha. I kind of have a nostalgia for the olden days, when scholars were fiercely protective of their intellectual breakthroughs!
[29/12/2022, 02:27:13] Alice Lafferty: I was kind of like 'sure buddy' but obviously not to his face. We'll see
[29/12/2022, 02:27:21] Alex Regueiro: There's a great story about Cardano and the others involved in the general solution of the cubic equation. Newton was also this way, as were his contemporaries.
[29/12/2022, 02:27:44] Alex Regueiro: Yep hah. Take the pragmatic stance eh.
[29/12/2022, 02:28:03] Alice Lafferty: To be fair it's an intellectual property thing.
[29/12/2022, 02:28:31] Alice Lafferty: Not that there's any fame or riches attached to solving philosophical problems anymore
[29/12/2022, 02:29:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, they didn't have the same protection then. Life as a scholar was much less institutionalised those days, and you had to rely almost totally on reputation, which could be made or broken in a moment of caution or indiscretion.
[29/12/2022, 02:29:35] Alex Regueiro: Basically they all hoped to get some rich noble patron
[29/12/2022, 02:29:44] Alex Regueiro: Alas...
[29/12/2022, 02:30:25] Alice Lafferty: Yeah. It seems like almost everything now is produced by teams of people anyway
[29/12/2022, 02:31:27] Alice Lafferty: I feel like we've talked about the patronage problem before
[29/12/2022, 02:32:17] Alex Regueiro: Yep I think so
[29/12/2022, 02:32:21] Alice Lafferty: But Peter Thiel apparently funds small-scale bloggers to write content he likes (this is all just alleged obviously)
[29/12/2022, 02:32:26] Alex Regueiro: perhaps in the context of the contemporary funding of the arts?
[29/12/2022, 02:32:41] Alex Regueiro: Depends on the area. Certainly in most sciences and engineering though
[29/12/2022, 02:33:19] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. Got his email address? I wouldn't mind starting up my old blog again...
[29/12/2022, 02:33:50] Alice Lafferty: Haha, no his people contact you...
[29/12/2022, 02:33:57] Alice Lafferty: One day you just get a phone call
[29/12/2022, 02:34:13] Alice Lafferty: I didn't know you had a blog, is it still live?
[29/12/2022, 02:34:25] Alice Lafferty: Or archived at least?
[29/12/2022, 02:34:26] Alex Regueiro: Sounds like the way out of the Matrix...
[29/12/2022, 02:35:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh no, not for years. I think I started it in 6th form, and continued it into my undergrad?
[29/12/2022, 02:35:09] Alex Regueiro: üëÄ
[29/12/2022, 02:35:22] Alice Lafferty: Well, you have to let me read it now
[29/12/2022, 02:35:53] Alice Lafferty: What kind of stuff did you write about?
[29/12/2022, 02:36:34] Alex Regueiro: Okay okay... but don't judge the naive young me too harshly please! Beneath all this bravado I'm still a tad sensitive heh
[29/12/2022, 02:37:13] Alice Lafferty: I'm not in any place to judge.. it's fine. I'm embarrassed by things I said last week.
[29/12/2022, 02:37:54] Alex Regueiro: Haha fair
[29/12/2022, 02:38:20] Alex Regueiro: I was only half serious anyway. My skin isn't half as thin as it used to be.
[29/12/2022, 02:39:16] Alex Regueiro: https://web.archive.org/web/20120604045230/http://blog.noldorin.com/
[29/12/2022, 02:39:22] Alex Regueiro: Some of it might not render properly
[29/12/2022, 02:40:20] Alex Regueiro: It's so nerdy haha. Some of the content makes me weirdly proud, some of it just makes me cringe.
[29/12/2022, 02:40:34] Alex Regueiro: I hope you realise what a tremendous display of faith/trust in you this is. üòâ
[29/12/2022, 02:42:26] Alex Regueiro: So it looks like I wrote those posts when I was about 18-21
[29/12/2022, 02:43:01] Alice Lafferty: Why would you be embarrassed by thisüòê. It's literally impressive maths & programming stuff as far as I can tell at first glance
[29/12/2022, 02:45:32] Alex Regueiro: Like I said, half of this is faux self-consciousness. üôÇ
[29/12/2022, 02:45:47] Alex Regueiro: The other half is some slightly simplistic philosophical opinions.
[29/12/2022, 02:45:51] Alex Regueiro: But hey, it was good fun writing it!
[29/12/2022, 02:46:06] Alex Regueiro: I also did a football blog (well, Bar√ßa) for a while.
[29/12/2022, 02:47:17] Alice Lafferty: https://web.archive.org/web/20130523215058/http://blog.noldorin.com/2009/05/the-optimality-of-morals/
[29/12/2022, 02:47:50] Alice Lafferty: You have a much better fleshed out ethical system at 20 than I do now!
[29/12/2022, 02:48:19] Alice Lafferty: It seems like you were heavily into Dune at this time.
[29/12/2022, 02:48:20] Alex Regueiro: But thanks. Do feel free to share your thoughts! It's not like I bared my soul or anything. (My good friend back then might have gotten closer to doing so. He was older and got me into blogging.)
[29/12/2022, 02:49:09] Alex Regueiro: I knew you'd pick up on that. The utilitarianism hasn't 100% left me, you could say...
[29/12/2022, 02:49:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I had read the first when I was like 15, but went ended up reading them all later. I loved my sci-fi in general then.
[29/12/2022, 02:52:30] Alice Lafferty: https://web.archive.org/web/20130523125659/http://blog.noldorin.com/2010/08/teaching-a-machine-to-read/
[29/12/2022, 02:52:36] Alice Lafferty: This is really interesting too
[29/12/2022, 02:53:08] Alice Lafferty: Rule utilitarianism is quite a different beast to Mill's utilitarianism, it's much more reasonable.
[29/12/2022, 02:53:16] Alice Lafferty: It's like hybridised deontology.
[29/12/2022, 02:56:00] Alice Lafferty: The link to the longer piece about space exploration here is broken, (which sucks!):
[29/12/2022, 02:56:02] Alice Lafferty: https://web.archive.org/web/20130523155759/http://blog.noldorin.com/2009/12/the-future-of-space-exploration/
[29/12/2022, 02:56:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah exactly. At least, that's the impression I got.
[29/12/2022, 02:56:42] Alex Regueiro: Seemed much more viable an ideology
[29/12/2022, 02:57:10] Alice Lafferty: Thank you for letting me read it! I'm not going to touch the computing stuff yet.
[29/12/2022, 02:57:15] Alex Regueiro: Well before the days of ChatGPT. üòÄ
[29/12/2022, 02:57:23] Alice Lafferty: Because I'm not well equipped to understand it
[29/12/2022, 02:57:38] Alice Lafferty: You had it all figured out..
[29/12/2022, 02:57:40] Alex Regueiro: "yet" ü§î
[29/12/2022, 02:57:40] Alex Regueiro: There you go praying again...
[29/12/2022, 02:58:13] Alex Regueiro: The people who think they have it all figured out invariably do not have it all figured out.
[29/12/2022, 02:58:15] Alice Lafferty: I know! My phone screen has like a very thin film of grease I think :)
[29/12/2022, 02:58:40] Alex Regueiro: Hah I see
[29/12/2022, 02:58:54] Alex Regueiro: That or John Wycliffe is channeling through you...
[29/12/2022, 02:59:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes true. It's pretty interesting to see the inchoate form of the ideas which I recognise from talking to you.
[29/12/2022, 02:59:55] Alex Regueiro: Inchoate... I love that word.
[29/12/2022, 03:00:16] Alice Lafferty: https://web.archive.org/web/20130524042009/http://blog.noldorin.com/2010/04/the-perils-of-government-and-bureaucracy/ This is a nice bit of libertarianism too!
[29/12/2022, 03:00:26] Alex Regueiro: And yes. I'm glad you can. I think? Most of my thought since then is evolutionary rather than revolutionary.
[29/12/2022, 03:00:28] Alice Lafferty: Same
[29/12/2022, 03:01:42] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. These days I'm extremely wary about libertarianism, though. Too naive, borderline utopian. I know I'm still influenced by some classical liberal thought though. üôÇ
[29/12/2022, 03:02:02] Alice Lafferty: Yes I can see that. It seems like you've moderated the desire for liberty while the general streak of anti-bureaucracy remains.
[29/12/2022, 03:02:13] Alex Regueiro: I honestly can't recall what I wrote now... I'm almost curious enough to want to dig it up
[29/12/2022, 03:02:19] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I think people's values are pretty much established by ~20
[29/12/2022, 03:02:42] Alice Lafferty: Apparently it was 3.5k words so it's a shame if it's gone
[29/12/2022, 03:02:49] Alex Regueiro: That's fair. I value social cohesion and harmony much more now, but some of that ideology is still there, I suppose...
[29/12/2022, 03:03:09] Alice Lafferty: Yeah that's just maturing maybe.
[29/12/2022, 03:03:21] Alex Regueiro: Their core predilections and inclinations, at least, yep.
[29/12/2022, 03:03:30] Alex Regueiro: I'd like to think so.
[29/12/2022, 03:04:45] Alice Lafferty: & the evolution is just finding better ways to fulfil those values.
[29/12/2022, 03:07:17] Alex Regueiro: Right, I think I'd agree with that..
[29/12/2022, 03:07:32] Alex Regueiro: or least fulfil those ideological "urges"
[30/12/2022, 00:54:59] Alex Regueiro: I found that paper on space exploration! It wrote it for my undergrad, start of second year. One of the softest things I got away with doing for that degree...
[30/12/2022, 00:55:42] Alex Regueiro: I got an email receipt from the uni the essay attached but all formatting removed hah.
[30/12/2022, 00:56:08] Alex Regueiro: What are your latest thoughts on your studies by the way? üôÇ
[31/12/2022, 03:57:28] Alice Lafferty: Ah, do you think it holds up well? Send it to me if you don't mind?
[31/12/2022, 03:58:21] Alice Lafferty: Not much really... the OU registration deadline is the 12th Jan. That will probably come and go though. I've checked out a bit really.
[31/12/2022, 03:58:32] Alice Lafferty: What kind of stuff do you have coming up next year?
[31/12/2022, 16:20:24] Alex Regueiro: Not terribly, I think? It's light on actual physics, and pretty cursory in parts, but still god a decent mark. I'll forward the email to you if you like... and don't mind the loss of all formatting.
[31/12/2022, 16:23:17] Alex Regueiro: As a high-level overview, it achieves its goal, I'd say!
[31/12/2022, 16:23:31] Alex Regueiro: Not too enamoured by the idea then, I take it?
[31/12/2022, 16:23:48] Alex Regueiro: Hopefully Cambridge will get back to you and be somewhat amenable...
[31/12/2022, 16:24:13] Alex Regueiro: It's all how you contextualise your desire to change courses I suppose.
[31/12/2022, 16:24:27] Alex Regueiro: Life/career plans generally?
[31/12/2022, 21:38:57] Alice Lafferty: Yes send it please!
[31/12/2022, 21:41:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh maybe I forgot to tell you, they did say I could migrate internally to pol sci. But I declined in the end because I know the same issues will arise no matter what course I'm doing. So I'm officially disenrolled there.
[31/12/2022, 21:42:29] Alex Regueiro: Hey!
[31/12/2022, 21:42:30] Alex Regueiro: Ohh
[31/12/2022, 21:42:36] Alice Lafferty: Yes will you carry on doing freelancing stuff?
[31/12/2022, 21:42:55] Alex Regueiro: I'm kind of sorry to hear... though it sounds like you've looked at it all very reasonably and dispassionately, so fair enough.
[31/12/2022, 21:43:15] Alex Regueiro: Chemistry was a step too far eh? Or perhaps you didn't ask about that eh...
[31/12/2022, 21:43:19] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's a shame
[31/12/2022, 21:43:31] Alex Regueiro: Okay sure. What's your email?
[31/12/2022, 21:43:34] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I didn't want to push it..
[31/12/2022, 21:43:52] Alice Lafferty: aliceolafferty@gmail.com
[31/12/2022, 21:46:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah for now definitely. I was pretty lucky things picked up with this American guy I used to contract for (help write software he sells). I think there's decent money in it, so short term I may rewrite a lot of that stuff from the ground up and add some features. The area (genetics, genealogy, and data processing) is pretty fun. Might get it on a share of the subscriptions if that works out.
[31/12/2022, 21:46:53] Alex Regueiro: Medium term, teaching myself machine learning properly
[31/12/2022, 21:47:24] Alex Regueiro: And keep pondering startup ideas with friends and people in my network, whom I know are interested in doing certain things. üôÇ
[31/12/2022, 21:48:40] Alex Regueiro: sent
[31/12/2022, 21:50:15] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah I remember
[31/12/2022, 21:50:48] Alice Lafferty: Sounds good!
[31/12/2022, 21:51:32] Alice Lafferty: Thanks I will readp
[31/12/2022, 21:53:33] Alex Regueiro: I mean, the startup I was contracting for... may not be totally over, but there's no great future or interest in that for me to be honest.
[31/12/2022, 21:53:57] Alex Regueiro: How about you? Or still thinking given you've disenrolled at Cambs now...
[31/12/2022, 21:56:51] Alex Regueiro: Yep! I'm relatively happy with my plans and goals now, after a long period of uncertainty...
[31/12/2022, 22:26:06] Alice Lafferty: This is good. Having a goal and the reasonable expectation that you will achieve it IS happiness.
[31/12/2022, 22:32:35] Alex Regueiro: Right. Something that's a little bit of a challenge but not completely unrealistic. The process of going after it is then fulfilment/happiness, I think.
[31/12/2022, 22:32:41] Alex Regueiro: ?
[31/12/2022, 22:35:39] Alex Regueiro: Hope you're keeping yourself entertained tonight by the way... I'm just messing around and avoiding the noisy party my parents are hosting downstairs!
[31/12/2022, 22:42:12] Alice Lafferty: ah, that sounds nice
[31/12/2022, 22:42:28] Alice Lafferty: My parents and brother have all gone out so I am home alone...
[31/12/2022, 22:42:57] Alice Lafferty: I'm just going to float along probably.
[31/12/2022, 22:45:14] Alex Regueiro: Ah. Into London or...?
[31/12/2022, 22:46:20] Alice Lafferty: Yeah
[31/12/2022, 22:46:43] Alex Regueiro: You can always have Macaulay Culkin for company!
[31/12/2022, 22:47:00] Alice Lafferty: Kind of in an elevated place, so might go to the park and watch the fireworks from afar.
[31/12/2022, 22:47:02] Alex Regueiro: Then a wise choice to pass, in my books...
[31/12/2022, 22:47:09] Alex Regueiro: very wise!
[31/12/2022, 22:47:56] Alice Lafferty: Oh no, I wasn't even invited. My brother went out with his friends and my parents have gone to some lawyers thing.
[31/12/2022, 22:48:00] Alex Regueiro: Quite reasonable given where you are right now. Perhaps you'll happen upon something that inspires you!
[31/12/2022, 22:48:14] Alex Regueiro: Oh I see, separate events.
[31/12/2022, 22:52:00] Alice Lafferty: Maybe!
[31/12/2022, 22:53:10] Alex Regueiro: If you can fulfil your resolution you'll be doing very well anyway
[01/01/2023, 14:48:34] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I got distracted then tired last night... Happy new year! üéâ
[01/01/2023, 19:02:13] Alice Lafferty: Hey, happy new year!
[01/01/2023, 19:48:45] Alice Lafferty: Starting a stretching routine
[01/01/2023, 19:49:06] Alice Lafferty: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29777149/

[01/01/2023, 20:29:59] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[01/01/2023, 20:30:23] Alex Regueiro: Cancer prevention? Nah, forget it. Cute mouse? Okay, I go stretch.
[01/01/2023, 20:30:39] Alex Regueiro: Thank ye!
‚Äé[01/01/2023, 21:48:39] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[01/01/2023, 21:48:43] Alex Regueiro: ü§î
[01/01/2023, 23:29:18] Alice Lafferty: Gee
[01/01/2023, 23:29:41] Alice Lafferty: Does it give anymore information about precisely how this ""wellbeing analysis"" was done?
[01/01/2023, 23:30:48] Alice Lafferty: If it's just like statistically how many times was the word 'happyüòÉ' or 'sadüòî' mentioned...
[01/01/2023, 23:33:13] Alice Lafferty: To be fair this does track with the depression & then wage stagnation in the late 20th C
[01/01/2023, 23:34:48] Alice Lafferty: I guess it also accounts for the evolution of social norms around discussing eg. mental health? Imo the 'happiness' of people living in the past is a total black box for this reason.
[02/01/2023, 00:09:27] Alex Regueiro: A friend shared this...
[02/01/2023, 00:09:51] Alex Regueiro: But yes, my first reaction was marked scepticism too!
[02/01/2023, 00:10:20] Alex Regueiro: Like, how would they have any reasonable metric for how happy people were in 1820?
[02/01/2023, 00:10:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's a good point.
[02/01/2023, 00:11:34] Alex Regueiro: It might just be a fairly basic analysis on Google Ngrams, yeah...
[02/01/2023, 00:11:45] Alex Regueiro: Anyway Thatcherites would like it!
[02/01/2023, 00:14:20] Alex Regueiro: Neo-Nazis maybe not so much
[02/01/2023, 00:32:12] Alice Lafferty: If [data] affirms my priors, then it is a valuable and should be propagated widely. If it does not, then it is full of heinous methodological flaws and should be censored. Simple.
[02/01/2023, 00:32:30] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, they don't.
[02/01/2023, 00:33:15] Alice Lafferty: It's also weird that they did not isolate data from East and West Germany?
[02/01/2023, 00:33:59] Alex Regueiro: Yes indeed.
[02/01/2023, 00:34:13] Alex Regueiro: There would have been a gulf in happiness
[02/01/2023, 00:34:15] Alice Lafferty: Unrelated but oddly specific: https://mobile.twitter.com/mezaoptimizer/status/1609299362567389184
[02/01/2023, 00:34:44] Alex Regueiro: Applied statistics in a nutshell. üòî
[02/01/2023, 00:34:54] Alice Lafferty: Not that I know what Lagrangians or hyperparameter tuning is
[02/01/2023, 00:35:21] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[02/01/2023, 00:35:28] Alex Regueiro: I can relate sliiightly
[02/01/2023, 00:35:49] Alex Regueiro: I can explain, but I think you'd probably regret asking
[02/01/2023, 00:36:14] Alice Lafferty: Can you do like a 'for dummies' version
[02/01/2023, 00:36:51] Alex Regueiro: Hyperparameter is actually pretty simple: it's just a parameter that's input by hand into some machine learning model, which you then use for training on your dataset
[02/01/2023, 00:37:03] Alex Regueiro: I actually used to kind of like those books.
[02/01/2023, 00:37:14] Alice Lafferty: I did look up Lagrangians but it seems to have different meanings in different fields.
[02/01/2023, 00:37:27] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[02/01/2023, 00:37:29] Alice Lafferty: Thanks
[02/01/2023, 00:39:57] Alex Regueiro: Lagrangian is a bit more abstract... but it's a quantity based on the "action" of a system. You've maybe heard of the "principle of least action", which is basically saying "nature is lazy" (crude paraphrase). The first version of this historically was something like... light rays will take the path (through some series of mediums) that minimises the time taken by the light. But this can be generalised immensely, and is actually the basis for the formulations of most modern theories of physics, in particular relativistic/quantum field theory.
[02/01/2023, 00:40:40] Alex Regueiro: You can solve Lagrangians for apparently very complex systems much easier than you could solve the explicit (Newtonian) equations of motion for example.
[02/01/2023, 00:41:05] Alex Regueiro: And when you get to quantum stuff, you don't even have actual equations of motion any more. Not per se.
[02/01/2023, 00:41:09] Alex Regueiro: Hopefully that makes some sense?
[02/01/2023, 00:41:21] Alice Lafferty: Is this like the principle of inertia
[02/01/2023, 00:42:30] Alice Lafferty: It does, I appreciate it.
[02/01/2023, 00:42:47] Alice Lafferty: And I'm sorry to not be able to discuss these things with you
[02/01/2023, 00:43:15] Alex Regueiro: The goal is still the same. To minimise the total "action" of the system, which the Lagrangian function helps you do.
[02/01/2023, 00:43:30] Alice Lafferty: In anything more than a kind of teacher-student dynamic.
[02/01/2023, 00:43:35] Alex Regueiro: No. That's just Newton's First Law. I can see why you think that though.
[02/01/2023, 00:43:50] Alex Regueiro: It has more to do with Snell's Law, if you remember that from your physics classes üôÇ
[02/01/2023, 00:44:27] Alex Regueiro: Don't worry, I enjoy talking about these things anyway... been a while!
[02/01/2023, 00:44:59] Alice Lafferty: This is about refraction?
[02/01/2023, 00:45:01] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok
[02/01/2023, 00:45:05] Alex Regueiro: Yep exactly
[02/01/2023, 00:45:55] Alex Regueiro: That's why I brought up the light rays example. Actually kind of amazing how such a specific principle (Fermat's principle) got generalised to become one of the foundations of all physics.
[02/01/2023, 00:46:58] Alice Lafferty: And a Langagrian is a unit of measure
[02/01/2023, 00:47:14] Alice Lafferty: *I spell it differently every time I type it lol
[02/01/2023, 00:47:28] Alice Lafferty: *or the quantity itself
[02/01/2023, 00:47:28] Alex Regueiro: This is kind of a physics meme... the Lagrangian for the entire Standard Model of Particle Physics! üòÄ
[02/01/2023, 00:47:29] Alex Regueiro: https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-deconstructed-standard-model-equation
[02/01/2023, 00:48:46] Alice Lafferty: I tried to memorise the particles in the standard model once without knowing properly what they were...
[02/01/2023, 00:48:57] Alice Lafferty: Ok I'm reading
[02/01/2023, 00:49:07] Alex Regueiro: Closer to the quantity. I mean, it's a function, but it gives a quantity (in units of energy, though not representing energy itself!) where the inputs represent the 'configuration' of the system
[02/01/2023, 00:49:41] Alex Regueiro: I might have done that too before I really understood particle physics. Well, I still don't you could say...
[02/01/2023, 00:49:49] Alex Regueiro: Good for quizzes though eh?
[02/01/2023, 00:50:38] Alice Lafferty: 'the Lagrangian is one of the easiest and most compact ways of presenting the theory.' followed by something indecipherableüòê
[02/01/2023, 00:51:43] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's the joke
[02/01/2023, 00:51:50] Alex Regueiro: physicists never work with anything remotely like that
[02/01/2023, 00:51:59] Alex Regueiro: it's completely insoluble and conceptually not even helpful
[02/01/2023, 00:52:01] Alice Lafferty: Is that correct that the standard model predicted the existence of lots of these particles before they were actually observer experimentally?
[02/01/2023, 00:52:26] Alex Regueiro: But Lagrangian mechanics was still invented as a elegant sort of "shortcut" to solving for the motion of mechanical systems
[02/01/2023, 00:53:05] Alex Regueiro: Yep. That prediction process was kind of messy and informal, but you could definitely say something like that.
[02/01/2023, 00:53:41] Alice Lafferty: In maths/phys does a 'function' refer to like a relation between variables
[02/01/2023, 00:53:57] Alex Regueiro: It's also led us down very expensive blind alleys (like upgrading the LHC only to find there's no particle at the mass you expected one at)
[02/01/2023, 00:54:09] Alice Lafferty: I see... it says on wikipedia (üòå) that it is like built on top of Newtonian mechanics
[02/01/2023, 00:54:25] Alex Regueiro: Yep, a specific sort of relation. But really you're already familiar with them. f(x), and such
[02/01/2023, 00:54:35] Alex Regueiro: Like in algebra/calculus
[02/01/2023, 00:54:45] Alex Regueiro: They can get arbitrarily complex, but same idea
[02/01/2023, 00:55:17] Alice Lafferty: Hm, are there other competing models
[02/01/2023, 00:55:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, sort of. I mean, it was invented by Lagrange well after Newton's mechanics, but that was the starting point. You can actually "throw away the ladder" of Newtonian mechanics afterwards if you like though... it's not that one is more fundamental than the other per se
[02/01/2023, 00:56:04] Alex Regueiro: Than the Standard Model? Not really nowadays, though there were in the past. It's certainly not the endpoint of particle physics.
[02/01/2023, 00:56:29] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, so it's considered to be basically correct.
[02/01/2023, 00:57:26] Alice Lafferty: I see
[02/01/2023, 00:57:55] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. What "correct" means in philosophy of science is actually quite involved, but it only breaks down in some real corner cases. Like ultra high energy.
[02/01/2023, 00:58:49] Alex Regueiro: Some physicists still consider its lack of elegancy a big signpost urging us to find a better (more general) theory that actually looks simpler.
[02/01/2023, 00:58:54] Alice Lafferty: Using your pragmatic approach, it's effectively 'true'.
[02/01/2023, 00:59:00] Alex Regueiro: Elegancy? Elegance. Damnit hah.
[02/01/2023, 00:59:14] Alex Regueiro: Yes üòä
[02/01/2023, 00:59:31] Alice Lafferty: Don't you still have to give an account of the areas where it 'breaks down'?
[02/01/2023, 01:00:38] Alex Regueiro: It's easier to give an account of where it holds, since that's experimentally verified. But it's an enormous range of conditions, which certainly encompasses everything in our everyday experiences, and almost everything within our solar system (except things like neutrino oscillations).
[02/01/2023, 01:01:02] Alex Regueiro: Black holes and the Big Bang (or whatever else physicists think happened or will happen) are the main places where our current laws of physics break down horribly.
[02/01/2023, 01:02:05] Alice Lafferty: I was reading about this recently...https://www.dunescience.org
[02/01/2023, 01:02:22] Alice Lafferty: *hh neutrino oscillations
[02/01/2023, 01:02:36] Alex Regueiro: How do you come across these things, incidentally? Do you get lost down Wikipedia rabbit holes or something like that?
[02/01/2023, 01:02:52] Alex Regueiro: (If so, very familiar experience for me. Well, in the past especially!)
[02/01/2023, 01:03:23] Alex Regueiro: I was hoping it had something to do with the science of Dune for a second. üòî
[02/01/2023, 01:03:24] Alice Lafferty: I think there are potential energy applications here if I remember correctly.
[02/01/2023, 01:03:49] Alice Lafferty: Right, the information horizon or something
[02/01/2023, 01:03:51] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's a really important experiment. Been going a while now I think?
[02/01/2023, 01:04:07] Alice Lafferty: I'm kind of peripherally aware of this from pop science more than anything.
[02/01/2023, 01:04:47] Alice Lafferty: I was kind of wondering what the goals of theoretical particle physicists were now, given that they've completed the standard model.
[02/01/2023, 01:04:47] Alex Regueiro: Usually called the event horizon, but it is also very much a horizon of information.
[02/01/2023, 01:05:09] Alex Regueiro: Might be? I honestly don't know
[02/01/2023, 01:05:23] Alice Lafferty: Right, we can't retrieve information from beyond it.
[02/01/2023, 01:05:44] Alex Regueiro: Ahh, the arrogance of physicists. We should have learnt by now. A lot of them sort of thought that in the 70s/80s, but now we have many holes to patch up
[02/01/2023, 01:06:24] Alex Regueiro: There's a famous late 19th quote on this theme, ironically JUST before relativity and quantum mechanics came along and utterly revolutionised physics.
[02/01/2023, 01:06:30] Alex Regueiro: Kelvin I think?
[02/01/2023, 01:07:07] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Here it is: "There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement" (1900)
[02/01/2023, 01:07:27] Alice Lafferty: Apparently can harvest energy from them in similar way to a traditional solar cell.
[02/01/2023, 01:07:44] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[02/01/2023, 01:07:55] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. Now you've taught me something!
[02/01/2023, 01:07:59] Alex Regueiro: Sort of makes sense though
[02/01/2023, 01:08:01] Alice Lafferty: Picture taken moments before a disaster.....
[02/01/2023, 01:08:06] Alex Regueiro: Indeed
[02/01/2023, 01:08:35] Alex Regueiro: I think Feynmann said something similar in the 70s? Funny. Both great physicists who should have been more careful with their words.
[02/01/2023, 01:09:01] Alice Lafferty: Didn't they still believe in the 'luminiferous ether' or something at this time?
[02/01/2023, 01:09:14] Alice Lafferty: *at the turn of the 20th C
[02/01/2023, 01:11:03] Alex Regueiro: The neutrino is an odd particle. It barely interacts with any other particles (including all those of ordinary matter), so if the chance of it interacting with any given molecule of water is something ludicrously small... you'd be waiting far longer than the age of universe for a single interaction, on average. But since these tanks of water in the experiment are so huge, that brings that chance up to something measurable. You still get extraordinarily few though... it's a real game of patience
[02/01/2023, 01:11:22] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, maybe. I forget when exactly the Michelson-Morley experiment was (that disproved it), but maybe right after 1900?
[02/01/2023, 01:11:51] Alex Regueiro: Ah no, 1887. But again in 1902/1905 with much better sensitivity.
[02/01/2023, 01:12:17] Alice Lafferty: What exactly is the general strategy for gathering information on black holes? Is it just taking higher and higher resolution photos (was thinking of that NASA one)
[02/01/2023, 01:12:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I remember reading something like this.. how on earth did they observe it then?
[02/01/2023, 01:13:25] Alice Lafferty: I had no idea how huge the labs at CERN were.
[02/01/2023, 01:13:48] Alex Regueiro: To some extent yes. Better telescopes, better imaging. But you can infer a great deal already. Since it's all about observing the light and motion of astronomical bodies surrounding the black hole.
[02/01/2023, 01:14:11] Alex Regueiro: Our entire galaxy (so our solar system for one) is rotating around a super-massive black hole.
[02/01/2023, 01:14:20] Alice Lafferty: The circumference of LHC is like 30km or something
[02/01/2023, 01:14:49] Alex Regueiro: I know the circumference of the LHC is 27km. Actually came in handy once at a quiz, years ago.
[02/01/2023, 01:15:00] Alex Regueiro: Yep üôÇ
[02/01/2023, 01:15:10] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok! I was kind of close
[02/01/2023, 01:15:39] Alex Regueiro: It's all about the probability distributions... if you're watched trillions upon trillions of water particles with an excellent "camera", then the timescale you have to wait for is much more reasonable
[02/01/2023, 01:15:50] Alice Lafferty: This does motivate me to learn a bit of astrophysics maybe so that I can understand this a bit better.
[02/01/2023, 01:16:06] Alex Regueiro: We have a saying in physics... if you're within an order of magnitude (factor of 10), it's good enough. üòâ
[02/01/2023, 01:16:54] Alice Lafferty: Surely not??
[02/01/2023, 01:16:58] Alex Regueiro: So... me saying I'm 1m tall is acceptable in the world of physicists. üéâ
[02/01/2023, 01:17:14] Alice Lafferty: I thought that was engineers who round pi down to 3
[02/01/2023, 01:17:30] Alex Regueiro: I mean, physicists do back-of-the-envelope calculations all the time. Obviously you need to get precise often, but so much is done in crude approximations.
[02/01/2023, 01:17:41] Alice Lafferty: I didn't know this
[02/01/2023, 01:17:44] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, there's definitely a meme somewhere about that too...
[02/01/2023, 01:18:04] Alice Lafferty: I assumed they'd have to be highly precise.
[02/01/2023, 01:18:29] Alex Regueiro: It can be fun. Depends what level you want to learn it at though...
[02/01/2023, 01:19:00] Alex Regueiro: Sometimes yes. When doing experiments or computational simulations. But not when thinking conceptually or brainstorming. Then, order of magnitude is "basically good enough".
[02/01/2023, 01:19:53] Alex Regueiro: Just found this hah. Brings back memories... https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~riesbeck/mathphyseng.html
[02/01/2023, 01:20:00] Alice Lafferty: Eh just so that vaguely understand what's happening, probably specifically cosmology.
[02/01/2023, 01:20:42] Alex Regueiro: Yeah cosmology is particularly interesting, so I shall encourage you there.
[02/01/2023, 01:21:00] Alex Regueiro: And also graspable at some decent level without the hardcore maths and physics.
[02/01/2023, 01:21:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes! This is what I was thinking of. Engineers can use 'for all practical purposes'
[02/01/2023, 01:21:34] Alex Regueiro: The one I remember actually isn't there!
[02/01/2023, 01:21:38] Alice Lafferty: I have tons of free time so
[02/01/2023, 01:22:04] Alex Regueiro: Physicists have innumerable jokes about engineers and chemists. üôÇ
[02/01/2023, 01:22:39] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I like the 'there's physics and there's stamp collecting'.
[02/01/2023, 01:22:45] Alex Regueiro: Then it will certainly be well spent.
[02/01/2023, 01:23:00] Alice Lafferty: Which you told me btw
[02/01/2023, 01:23:05] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Didn't I tell that one to you the first time we met? You'd probably already heard it though.
[02/01/2023, 01:23:06] Alex Regueiro: heh
[02/01/2023, 01:23:32] Alex Regueiro: So, the one I recall is actually about a biologist, an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician.
[02/01/2023, 01:23:38] Alice Lafferty: How are you approaching teaching yourself ML?
[02/01/2023, 01:23:44] Alex Regueiro: And I may have slightly modified it in my head.
[02/01/2023, 01:23:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok tell the joke firstp
[02/01/2023, 01:24:19] Alex Regueiro: There are a few (actually very good) free online courses. I'll probably do it pragmatically to start, then fill in with theory after (I have some good books noted down too).
[02/01/2023, 01:24:26] Alex Regueiro: Okay, let me try...
[02/01/2023, 01:25:24] Alice Lafferty: Ok, sounds good. I guess you know some people who can put you onto good resources too.
[02/01/2023, 01:29:02] Alex Regueiro: A biologist, an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are standing outside a bar that they know is empty (say, it just opened).
[02/01/2023, 01:29:28] Alex Regueiro: At one point they see 5 people enter the bar.
[02/01/2023, 01:30:27] Alex Regueiro: Some time passes, without anyone else entering, and they at last see 6 people exit the bar.
[02/01/2023, 01:31:27] Alice Lafferty: The biologist says: they reproduced!
[02/01/2023, 01:31:30] Alex Regueiro: The physicist is perplexed, so he asks his friends what they think happened?
[02/01/2023, 01:31:34] Alex Regueiro: Haha you got it
[02/01/2023, 01:31:41] Alice Lafferty: But I don't know the others..
[02/01/2023, 01:31:43] Alex Regueiro: (But that's still not the punchline)
[02/01/2023, 01:31:55] Alex Regueiro: So the engineer says, "There must have been a measurement error."
[02/01/2023, 01:32:14] Alex Regueiro: The biologist then remarks, "No, they must have reproduced!"
[02/01/2023, 01:32:30] Alex Regueiro: Finally, the mathematician says, "If one more person enters, the bar will be empty."
[02/01/2023, 01:32:48] Alex Regueiro: ü•Å
[02/01/2023, 01:33:37] Alice Lafferty: ... I am thinking about this
[02/01/2023, 01:33:46] Alice Lafferty: Is he talking about negative integersp
[02/01/2023, 01:33:50] Alex Regueiro: There may have been a comment about a spacetime discontinuum or something from the physicist, but maybe I'm making that up!
[02/01/2023, 01:34:00] Alex Regueiro: Yep that's basically it.
[02/01/2023, 01:34:25] Alice Lafferty: I thought the physicist was going to say something about quantum flux or something
[02/01/2023, 01:34:27] Alex Regueiro: Making fun of how mathematicians only work in the abstract world and have no common sense.
[02/01/2023, 01:34:37] Alice Lafferty: Lol it took me an embarrassingly long time to get that!
[02/01/2023, 01:34:50] Alex Regueiro: I probably should have added something like that, but I had the physicist play the passive role here!
[02/01/2023, 01:35:07] Alice Lafferty: The physicist is the straight man of the joke universe
[02/01/2023, 01:35:20] Alice Lafferty: Of course
[02/01/2023, 01:35:31] Alex Regueiro: Hey, there's some mathematicians who would never get it!
[02/01/2023, 01:35:49] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that was my thought too. ü§ì
[02/01/2023, 01:35:56] Alex Regueiro: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9imfz/a_mathematician_walks_into_a_bar_and_asks_for_ten/
[02/01/2023, 01:36:09] Alex Regueiro: That terrible joke came up while I was Googling previously
[02/01/2023, 01:36:30] Alex Regueiro: Just sharing it because we were just talking about orders of magnitude!
[02/01/2023, 01:36:32] Alice Lafferty: Yeah this is the problem you raised before right?
[02/01/2023, 01:37:04] Alice Lafferty: Haha yours was better though
[02/01/2023, 01:37:35] Alice Lafferty: I enjoy jokes about fields of which I am not a member...
[02/01/2023, 01:37:49] Alex Regueiro: Yep. To be fair it's much more pure mathmos than applied, but still... Philosophical questions that underpin mathematics just never get thought about by scientists and applied mathematicians, whereas pure mathematicians are all damnable naive platonists!
[02/01/2023, 01:38:15] Alex Regueiro: Hah thanks. Though I certainly don't claim I invented it.
[02/01/2023, 01:38:27] Alex Regueiro: Yep! Feel free to tell me any ones about theologians though...
[02/01/2023, 01:39:07] Alice Lafferty: Isn't applied maths just like science and engineering. In all seriousness what other application does it have...
[02/01/2023, 01:39:35] Alice Lafferty: Uh, I think they are a bit thin on the ground.
[02/01/2023, 01:39:50] Alice Lafferty: Best I can do is joke about Catholic priests and altar boys
[02/01/2023, 01:40:02] Alice Lafferty: Oh wait I do have one: why are Anglicans bad at chess?
[02/01/2023, 01:40:56] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, I was reading the other day about how the great mathematician Laplace went off to uni to study theology, completely lost interest, dropped out and became a mathematician! Now he's in the history/text books. Maybe you can take heart from that hah?
[02/01/2023, 01:41:04] Alex Regueiro: Hmm
[02/01/2023, 01:41:08] Alex Regueiro: They don't want to lose their bishops?
[02/01/2023, 01:41:24] Alex Regueiro: something along those lines surely!
[02/01/2023, 01:41:48] Alex Regueiro: Or about the king?
[02/01/2023, 01:41:55] Alice Lafferty: The average theology drop out student goes to work in a McDonalds. Laplace is an outlier and should not have been counted.
[02/01/2023, 01:42:14] Alice Lafferty: Very close: they can't tell their queens from their bishops!
[02/01/2023, 01:42:42] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much. It's just focusing on the mathematical methods that get used in science/engineering (including the social sciences occasionally).
[02/01/2023, 01:42:58] Alice Lafferty: *or kings as would be appropriate now, but I think it was designed to refer specifically to Elizabeth I
[02/01/2023, 01:43:07] Alex Regueiro: Ha
[02/01/2023, 01:43:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's what I was thinking
[02/01/2023, 01:44:15] Alex Regueiro: That's disappointing. I would have at least expected a higher-class fast food establishment... you know, Wahaca or something.
[02/01/2023, 01:45:55] Alice Lafferty: I've noticed that maths and particularly statistics is really king in pretty much every field. I was looking into ecology at one point, and honestly the most in demand roles were data scientists.
[02/01/2023, 01:46:36] Alice Lafferty: The same is true for like the finance ('quants')/marketing/social sciences
[02/01/2023, 01:47:21] Alice Lafferty: That's aspirational
[02/01/2023, 01:47:49] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, these days I'd definitely agree. The higher-level sciences got mathematised rather later than physics (or chemistry), but they all seem to be going the same way, and perhaps just as well... I mean, they'll probably never (cannot ever) reach the level of physics in terms of mathematical rigour, but they're no longer the purely qualitative subjects they used to be.
[02/01/2023, 01:48:05] Alex Regueiro: Physics used to be purely qualitative back in Aristotle's day, after all!
[02/01/2023, 01:48:22] Alice Lafferty: Yea true
[02/01/2023, 01:48:25] Alex Regueiro: Back when you were super into permaculture?
[02/01/2023, 01:49:08] Alex Regueiro: I'm so glad I didn't become a quant or another technical role in IB. The lifestyle and unadulterated neuroticism of the workplace would have killed me heh.
[02/01/2023, 01:49:35] Alice Lafferty: Specifically probabilistics is guiding people's decisions to a much greater degree than ever before, it seems?
[02/01/2023, 01:49:40] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes
[02/01/2023, 01:50:11] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah it's like traditional banking in that way (I believe)
[02/01/2023, 01:50:20] Alice Lafferty: But VERY well remunerated
[02/01/2023, 01:50:57] Alex Regueiro: Yep, for sure. I saw an article recently (by an academic I think?) suggesting students should be learning advanced statistics these days rather than calculus, given the ever-increasing demand in so many jobs.
[02/01/2023, 01:51:14] Alex Regueiro: Depends what you mean by traditional banking...
[02/01/2023, 01:51:18] Alex Regueiro: For sure.
[02/01/2023, 01:51:25] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[02/01/2023, 01:51:58] Alice Lafferty: I wonder if it's just sort of trendy and people will go back to more principle-based business strategies?
[02/01/2023, 01:52:02] Alice Lafferty: Or is it genuinely more efficient
[02/01/2023, 01:52:04] Alex Regueiro: An internship was enough for me. Really interesting intellectually, and a nice experience too, but not my cup of tea, as they say.
[02/01/2023, 01:52:41] Alex Regueiro: Rather than just rationalistically optimising for certain hard metrics, you mean?
[02/01/2023, 01:52:43] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah of course I forgot your dad works in finance
[02/01/2023, 01:52:46] Alex Regueiro: using statistics
[02/01/2023, 01:53:01] Alice Lafferty: Where did you do your internship?
[02/01/2023, 01:53:05] Alex Regueiro: Worked. Thankfully retired for a number of years now. Still hasn't fully left the world behind though, you could say.
[02/01/2023, 01:53:11] Alex Regueiro: Nomura
[02/01/2023, 01:53:49] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok. I'm not familiar, but I wouldn't be.
[02/01/2023, 01:53:51] Alex Regueiro: This was not so long after Lehman Brothers went down (my dad was working there when it did!), and they hired a lot of ex Lehman people in London.
[02/01/2023, 01:54:03] Alex Regueiro: They're the biggest Japanese/Asian investment bank, but not particularly well known over here.
[02/01/2023, 01:54:38] Alice Lafferty: Oh wow! My dad did legal work for Lehman Bros too.
[02/01/2023, 01:54:52] Alice Lafferty: Oh right
[02/01/2023, 01:55:18] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it looks kind of intense
[02/01/2023, 01:56:25] Alex Regueiro: Ah interesting. Hopefully not helping Dick Fuld get away with all his evil shenanigans! üòâ
[02/01/2023, 01:57:07] Alice Lafferty: I honestly don't know.. I should ask him more about it. He definitely provided some arse-covering services though.
[02/01/2023, 01:57:10] Alex Regueiro: Yep, generally IB / capital markets is. The London culture was just like any British or American bank really, but he found it fascinating when he visited the head office in Tokyo once.
[02/01/2023, 01:57:17] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[02/01/2023, 01:57:19] Alex Regueiro: fair
[02/01/2023, 01:58:01] Alex Regueiro: My dad pretty much hated Dick Fuld. He never properly met him, but he knew exactly what he was like, and had to attend talks by him.
[02/01/2023, 01:59:44] Alex Regueiro: Ooh, I almost forgot! I got an email from the BFI the other day, and by pure coincidence they're highlighting the works of Bergman and Kurosawa right now. Especially the latter. üôåüèº
[02/01/2023, 01:59:52] Alex Regueiro: Or Bergstrom, I should say.
[02/01/2023, 02:00:32] Alex Regueiro: I'm definitely going to go see one. Do you have any interest?
[02/01/2023, 02:00:35] Alex Regueiro: https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=fannyandalexander
[02/01/2023, 02:01:19] Alex Regueiro: https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=akirakurosawa
[02/01/2023, 02:02:04] Alice Lafferty: 'Fuld was nicknamed "the gorilla" for his intimidating presence' üòê
[02/01/2023, 02:02:26] Alice Lafferty: You mean it was different in Asian banks?
[02/01/2023, 02:03:00] Alice Lafferty: :D
[02/01/2023, 02:03:07] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah. Seems well deserved, based on the one or two stories my dad told me!
[02/01/2023, 02:03:42] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. As you might expect, the culture in Nomura Japan was rather different... better in some ways, worse in others.
[02/01/2023, 02:03:44] Alice Lafferty: Is this one you've seen before?
[02/01/2023, 02:03:58] Alex Regueiro: It is
[02/01/2023, 02:04:08] Alex Regueiro: One of his masterpieces no doubt
[02/01/2023, 02:04:21] Alice Lafferty: Oh maybe I'm thinking of China who have the 996 working system
[02/01/2023, 02:05:00] Alex Regueiro: I'm also slightly disconcerted how that that particular photo looks a tad like my sister and me when we were young!
[02/01/2023, 02:05:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes it looks fun? This time my attendance will be something you can hold me to.
[02/01/2023, 02:06:09] Alice Lafferty: But you should pick the film I think
[02/01/2023, 02:06:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, they don't enforce that but the expectations and general culture are kind of extreme. I think South Korea and Japan are officially the two hardest-working countries.
[02/01/2023, 02:06:34] Alice Lafferty: The same is true of the January salon
[02/01/2023, 02:07:03] Alice Lafferty: Yea that's why they don't have any kids
[02/01/2023, 02:07:22] Alex Regueiro: Okay. Any preference between Bergman and Kurosawa? Just the one Bergman film actually, but several Kurosawa films. He did a lot of old (Samurai-era) ones, which he's probably most famous for, but also some ones set in mid-20th C Japan when he lived.
[02/01/2023, 02:07:39] Alice Lafferty: Tbf I think 996 is almost what some people in finance in London/NY or whatever are working on probs
[02/01/2023, 02:08:11] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Did I tell you about the modern Japanese practice of high-flying career-driven women basically just arranging to marry their best male friend when they hit 30? It might have been someone else I told recently, not sure...
[02/01/2023, 02:08:23] Alice Lafferty: You can pick one of the Kurosawa films since you've already seen the Bergman?
[02/01/2023, 02:08:38] Alice Lafferty: No yes that was me
[02/01/2023, 02:08:42] Alex Regueiro: There might be an issue around all the effeminate cultural habits of many Japanese men too... though I don't want to open that can of worms right now!
[02/01/2023, 02:09:08] Alex Regueiro: I've seen all of the famous Kurosawa ones too, so I'm really open. It was ages ago now though. üôÇ
[02/01/2023, 02:09:22] Alice Lafferty: It's obviously not working that well for them though
[02/01/2023, 02:09:41] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Well, my dad would often work 7 or 7:30 for 11/12 hours. Not six days a week though.
[02/01/2023, 02:09:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha, it's quite similar to like those k-pop boy bands.
[02/01/2023, 02:09:53] Alex Regueiro: Splendid
[02/01/2023, 02:09:57] Alice Lafferty: Who are literally androgynes
[02/01/2023, 02:10:20] Alice Lafferty: Ok.
[02/01/2023, 02:10:21] Alex Regueiro: Honestly I don't get how Korean girls go gaga over those guys haha.
[02/01/2023, 02:10:34] Alice Lafferty: I will look at the dates as well.
[02/01/2023, 02:10:37] Alex Regueiro: Sure
[02/01/2023, 02:10:45] Alice Lafferty: Not just the Koreans!
[02/01/2023, 02:10:57] Alex Regueiro: Fanny & Alexander is actually just on the 3rd I think? Not sure if that's too soon. Kurosawa ones a bit later.
[02/01/2023, 02:11:12] Alice Lafferty: The 3rd as in tomorrow?
[02/01/2023, 02:11:19] Alice Lafferty: Oh well, Wednesday.
[02/01/2023, 02:11:38] Alex Regueiro: True. Though I think it's a much higher proportion of East Asian girls than Western ones. But you get this contemporary fad of Western girls trying to emulate them in appearance and behaviour too so...
[02/01/2023, 02:11:52] Alex Regueiro: (Just don't tell me you fancy some K-pop boy band star... please!)
[02/01/2023, 02:12:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, technically tomorrow. (Though not in my system!)
[02/01/2023, 02:12:25] Alice Lafferty: This is another one of my pet theories: there is some sort of specific phasal sexuality in girls age ~11-14.
[02/01/2023, 02:12:38] Alice Lafferty: That causes you to become attracted to like very feminine men .
[02/01/2023, 02:12:45] Alex Regueiro: Yes. I think you're quite right.
[02/01/2023, 02:13:20] Alex Regueiro: Not that I was dating at that age or even paying particularly close attention to the habits of girls that age... but seems about right
[02/01/2023, 02:13:26] Alice Lafferty: *it happened to me and nearly every girl I know. I was obsessed with Thomas Brodie-Sangster at that age. Who is pretty waifish.
[02/01/2023, 02:13:47] Alex Regueiro: Haha I'm going to find out all your crushes at this rate.
[02/01/2023, 02:13:57] Alex Regueiro: girlhood crushes that is
[02/01/2023, 02:14:06] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I can't imagine the cause though
[02/01/2023, 02:14:07] Alex Regueiro: David Tennant is rather understandable at least!
[02/01/2023, 02:14:17] Alice Lafferty: Yes sorry!
[02/01/2023, 02:14:35] Alex Regueiro: Wow, he's my age and he still looks remarkably boyish.
[02/01/2023, 02:14:46] Alice Lafferty: You have to tell me one of yours in exchange
[02/01/2023, 02:14:54] Alex Regueiro: No, it's fine. I'm just mildly amused. üôÇ
[02/01/2023, 02:14:57] Alex Regueiro: Hmm okay
[02/01/2023, 02:15:00] Alice Lafferty: I know.. he was a teenager in Love Actually
[02/01/2023, 02:15:01] Alex Regueiro: Have to think
[02/01/2023, 02:15:03] Alice Lafferty: S crazy
[02/01/2023, 02:15:21] Alex Regueiro: ?
[02/01/2023, 02:15:33] Alex Regueiro: Oh, "it's"
[02/01/2023, 02:15:34] Alex Regueiro: yeah
[02/01/2023, 02:15:39] Alice Lafferty: *how useful he looks
[02/01/2023, 02:15:48] Alice Lafferty: Hahah I meant 'youthful' ??
[02/01/2023, 02:15:52] Alice Lafferty: That is so interesting.
[02/01/2023, 02:15:51] Alex Regueiro: hahah
[02/01/2023, 02:16:06] Alice Lafferty: I obviously was thinking phonetically not semantically.
[02/01/2023, 02:16:08] Alice Lafferty: So weird.
[02/01/2023, 02:16:09] Alex Regueiro: Youthful but useless, I'd wager.
[02/01/2023, 02:16:17] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Just like me, as you know. üòÄ
[02/01/2023, 02:16:42] Alice Lafferty: Yeahüò¨
[02/01/2023, 02:17:38] Alice Lafferty: Confirms that Freudian slips do not like convey meaningful subconscious information.
[02/01/2023, 02:18:54] Alex Regueiro: Now that you made me think about it I could probably tell you a few. But I'm not sure which will put me in a good light haha
[02/01/2023, 02:19:04] Alex Regueiro: Right. They're usually just slips.
[02/01/2023, 02:19:32] Alice Lafferty: ... were they animations/video game characters
[02/01/2023, 02:19:42] Alex Regueiro: No, all actresses I think
[02/01/2023, 02:19:53] Alice Lafferty: Don't worry, mine are pretty indefensible
[02/01/2023, 02:20:08] Alex Regueiro: I was never hugely into either of those things. PS/computer games somewhat, but not hugely
[02/01/2023, 02:20:49] Alex Regueiro: Haha, well that Thomas guy is odd from my perspective, but if I picture you as a 13/14 year old girl, then makes much more sense!
[02/01/2023, 02:20:59] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. I thought you were going to come out with a list of 'waifus' or something! Haha
[02/01/2023, 02:21:00] Alex Regueiro: Tennant very understandable like I said.
[02/01/2023, 02:21:16] Alex Regueiro: That reminds me of a great clip...
[02/01/2023, 02:21:25] Alex Regueiro: I saw quite recently
[02/01/2023, 02:22:28] Alice Lafferty: Go on
[02/01/2023, 02:22:45] Alex Regueiro: Yes, sorry
[02/01/2023, 02:23:44] Alex Regueiro: Err, young Jennifer Connelly (in old films). Mia Sara.
[02/01/2023, 02:24:05] Alice Lafferty: *Sorry I meant the clip
[02/01/2023, 02:24:13] Alex Regueiro: Oh okay
[02/01/2023, 02:24:14] Alice Lafferty: Jennifer Connelly: would
[02/01/2023, 02:24:20] Alex Regueiro: well there you got my answer anyway!
[02/01/2023, 02:24:21] Alice Lafferty: Of course
[02/01/2023, 02:24:28] Alex Regueiro: would?
[02/01/2023, 02:24:36] Alice Lafferty: I don't know who Mia Sara is
[02/01/2023, 02:24:43] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I would....
[02/01/2023, 02:25:09] Alex Regueiro: She was in Legend and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
[02/01/2023, 02:25:15] Alice Lafferty: I just looked her up, interesting, they have very similar colouring.
[02/01/2023, 02:25:58] Alex Regueiro: And because it's all out now... Eva Green, a bit later on.
[02/01/2023, 02:26:07] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah? I never thought of that.
[02/01/2023, 02:26:24] Alex Regueiro: I'm still confused, sorry, haha
[02/01/2023, 02:26:51] Alice Lafferty: These are all completely respectable choices. Nothing odd here.
[02/01/2023, 02:26:59] Alice Lafferty: She is v beautiful
[02/01/2023, 02:27:05] Alex Regueiro: https://www.reddit.com/r/MemriTVmemes/comments/wmeyou/influencing_the_younger_generations/
[02/01/2023, 02:27:33] Alex Regueiro: There's the clip. Legit clip from some Islamic TV channel and legit captions.
[02/01/2023, 02:27:45] Alice Lafferty: Not like 'I always wanted to have sex with the old woman from Titanic' or something
[02/01/2023, 02:28:42] Alex Regueiro: Okay, phew. I mean, it's nice to get your approval... just in case you ever decide to think of me as more than a friend again, at some point! üòâ
[02/01/2023, 02:28:50] Alice Lafferty: LOL
[02/01/2023, 02:28:55] Alex Regueiro: Hahah. Yeah, that would be a red flag...
[02/01/2023, 02:28:58] Alex Regueiro: at all levels
[02/01/2023, 02:29:37] Alice Lafferty: These are just such a rich source of comedy
[02/01/2023, 02:29:44] Alex Regueiro: It's great isn't it?
‚Äé[02/01/2023, 02:30:03] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[02/01/2023, 02:30:16] Alex Regueiro: Something about a middle-aged Islamic scholar very objectively explaining the "waifu" problem in society.
[02/01/2023, 02:30:18] Alex Regueiro: Just hilarious
[02/01/2023, 02:30:24] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes, I love that one too
[02/01/2023, 02:30:31] Alex Regueiro: Have you seen them before?
[02/01/2023, 02:30:56] Alex Regueiro: Could be Suella Braverman's new slogan that!
[02/01/2023, 02:31:23] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's like the absurdity of two totally disparate cultures meeting
[02/01/2023, 02:31:30] Alex Regueiro: exactly
[02/01/2023, 02:31:43] Alice Lafferty: This is used to indicate 'I would have sex with them'
[02/01/2023, 02:31:45] Alice Lafferty: Sorry
[02/01/2023, 02:31:58] Alice Lafferty: But like, as a term it's much more casual.
[02/01/2023, 02:32:08] Alice Lafferty: Not a real statement of intent. More like saying 'hot'
[02/01/2023, 02:32:17] Alex Regueiro: Oh, must be a zoomer thing. I should probably still know, sorry...
[02/01/2023, 02:32:21] Alex Regueiro: Yeah.
[02/01/2023, 02:32:30] Alex Regueiro: I didn't think you were implying you had lesbian feelings heh
[02/01/2023, 02:34:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh did I never tell you that like I'm kind of a non-practicing lesbian in some sense
[02/01/2023, 02:34:22] Alex Regueiro: Oh interesting
[02/01/2023, 02:34:22] Alice Lafferty: Well, this is something I'm in general confused about because look at this:
[02/01/2023, 02:35:03] Alex Regueiro: Do tell...
[02/01/2023, 02:37:34] Alice Lafferty: Ok it's taking too long to find a good source.
[02/01/2023, 02:37:58] Alice Lafferty: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00750.x
[02/01/2023, 02:38:58] Alice Lafferty: Basically self-described heterosexual women are equally aroused by images male and female bodies. So I don't know if maybe this is just like normal female sexuality.
[02/01/2023, 02:39:10] Alice Lafferty: This is also TMI, so I'm sorry.
[02/01/2023, 02:39:21] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of interesting again on a non-personal level.
[02/01/2023, 02:39:37] Alex Regueiro: Interesting
[02/01/2023, 02:39:42] Alex Regueiro: No, it's fine
[02/01/2023, 02:39:57] Alex Regueiro: I'm curious both an intellectual level and your personal experience too
[02/01/2023, 02:40:11] Alice Lafferty: https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/11/study-finds-most-straight-women-are-aroused-by-naked-men-and-women-are-they-bi.html
[02/01/2023, 02:40:14] Alex Regueiro: So you think you fit that archetype described the study, to some extent?
[02/01/2023, 02:40:27] Alice Lafferty: They have gone missing in my index of papers...
[02/01/2023, 02:40:33] Alice Lafferty: So that's all I can find
[02/01/2023, 02:40:54] Alex Regueiro: I've never really thought about it, but prima facie it's kind of believable.
[02/01/2023, 02:41:09] Alice Lafferty: Well yes, although I have literally never had any desire to actually pursue a romantic relationship with a woman at all.
[02/01/2023, 02:41:20] Alex Regueiro: Just another example of where the male/female symmetry breaks down.
[02/01/2023, 02:41:27] Alex Regueiro: Fair.
[02/01/2023, 02:41:40] Alex Regueiro: Not that I'd particularly care if you did...
[02/01/2023, 02:41:54] Alice Lafferty: I have my own theory about this derived from my experience but it's simply too gross to really tell you
[02/01/2023, 02:42:01] Alex Regueiro: Haha okay
[02/01/2023, 02:42:40] Alex Regueiro: As long as it's not neo-Freudian or anything... vagina-envy? ü§î
[02/01/2023, 02:42:41] Alice Lafferty: But that female attraction to other women is basically vestigial.
[02/01/2023, 02:42:56] Alice Lafferty: No no nothing like that. Firmly rooted in evo psych :)
[02/01/2023, 02:43:02] Alex Regueiro: Ah good stuff
[02/01/2023, 02:43:35] Alice Lafferty: It's really difficult because women tend to be pretty reticent about this stuff publicly.
[02/01/2023, 02:43:44] Alice Lafferty: So I have no real way of knowing whether it's normal.
[02/01/2023, 02:43:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, for obvious reasons
[02/01/2023, 02:44:03] Alice Lafferty: No but much more so than men
[02/01/2023, 02:44:46] Alex Regueiro: There may even be a male analogue. I mean, there's a strong evo psych motivation for bonding in hunting/war groups and whatnot, and some of that seems to come out in the military or boarding schools or whatnot... possibly? Honestly not thought about it so much
[02/01/2023, 02:44:58] Alice Lafferty: Men like regularly discuss publicly whether they like x or y feature, blondes, brunettes, their reproductive organs etc
[02/01/2023, 02:45:18] Alice Lafferty: Haha yeah true homosexuality is one of the big puzzles
[02/01/2023, 02:45:23] Alex Regueiro: "their reproductive organs" üòÇ
[02/01/2023, 02:45:25] Alex Regueiro: You're not wrong
[02/01/2023, 02:45:54] Alex Regueiro: I do have a theory (maybe not even mine) that it's evolutionary beneficial for societies/tribes to have a small number of gay men, however.
[02/01/2023, 02:45:59] Alice Lafferty: Well... I can talk about some of this stuff very openly but I'm still kind of a prude in some ways.
[02/01/2023, 02:46:02] Alex Regueiro: But that's another story
[02/01/2023, 02:46:17] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I've heard that as well?
[02/01/2023, 02:46:22] Alice Lafferty: I don't really buy it though.
[02/01/2023, 02:46:36] Alex Regueiro: It's okay. You really don't have to. I have that prudish corner of my mind too... from my Catholic upbringing and/or my intrinsic personality!
[02/01/2023, 02:46:45] Alex Regueiro: I'm honestly not sure
[02/01/2023, 02:46:53] Alex Regueiro: Could probably be convinced either way
[02/01/2023, 02:46:59] Alice Lafferty: I suspect it's the result of a (harmless) in utero hormonal issue.
[02/01/2023, 02:47:44] Alice Lafferty: I don't find the fitness benefits convincing.
[02/01/2023, 02:48:07] Alice Lafferty: Bonding - we already have lots of bonding mechanisms.
[02/01/2023, 02:48:13] Alex Regueiro: If there are fitness benefits it's going to be pretty convoluted and only works at some higher (social) level
[02/01/2023, 02:48:23] Alex Regueiro: Oh I wasn't suggesting that. So yeah, I agree there
[02/01/2023, 02:48:31] Alice Lafferty: And besides, gay men are not famous for forming particularly strong bond with their sexual partners..
[02/01/2023, 02:48:44] Alex Regueiro: True
[02/01/2023, 02:48:52] Alex Regueiro: Though I'm not sure how much of that is down to modern Western culture
[02/01/2023, 02:49:00] Alice Lafferty: What else? That gay men act as 'uncles' or something.
[02/01/2023, 02:49:11] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I'm not familiar with all the theories put forward
[02/01/2023, 02:49:17] Alice Lafferty: So have dismissed it unfairly.
[02/01/2023, 02:49:31] Alex Regueiro: I'm not familiar with the details either. Just the basic idea.
[02/01/2023, 02:49:48] Alex Regueiro: Possibly in reducing average competition/aggression between men?
[02/01/2023, 02:49:54] Alex Regueiro: just a stab in the dark though
[02/01/2023, 02:50:18] Alice Lafferty: Does it though? Isn't homosexual sex often the very mechanism of violence itself?
[02/01/2023, 02:50:32] Alice Lafferty: I'm thinking specifically of prisons.
[02/01/2023, 02:50:47] Alice Lafferty: Maybe it's just a way of asserting dominance.
[02/01/2023, 02:50:58] Alex Regueiro: Well it certainly decreases competition, and competition for sexual partner is a major cause of aggression in men (psycho-hormonally).
[02/01/2023, 02:51:06] Alex Regueiro: More likely that, I think.
[02/01/2023, 02:51:20] Alice Lafferty: It doesn't explain the men who enjoy taking the non-dominant role though
[02/01/2023, 02:51:26] Alice Lafferty: If you catch my drift
[02/01/2023, 02:51:47] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, out of curiosity... would you say the feeling you have when you see an attractive women more psychological or hormonal? Genuinely curious about this phenomenon.
[02/01/2023, 02:51:59] Alex Regueiro: Oh I just meant in prisons
[02/01/2023, 02:52:25] Alice Lafferty: Oh it's not psychological at all. It totally bypasses the brain lol
[02/01/2023, 02:52:25] Alex Regueiro: Yes, it certainly doesn't explain why you get bottoms heh
[02/01/2023, 02:53:00] Alex Regueiro: Right. So it's kind of hormonal more than even your "primitive (sub)conscious"?
[02/01/2023, 02:53:06] Alice Lafferty: I can see the 'top' role as just being another permutation of male hypersexuality.
[02/01/2023, 02:53:24] Alice Lafferty: Like, some men will have sex with animals/objects/each other in the absence of women.
[02/01/2023, 02:53:39] Alex Regueiro: Could be, though my gut instinct says that's too simplistic.
[02/01/2023, 02:53:41] Alice Lafferty: But yeah the other role is a mystery.
[02/01/2023, 02:54:10] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, but not being Welsh, I can't really imagine this!
[02/01/2023, 02:54:36] Alice Lafferty: It really does feel like a very atavistic hormonal trigger yes.
[02/01/2023, 02:55:11] Alice Lafferty: Like, it maps well onto how straight men describe their sexuality. Except minus the romance part.
[02/01/2023, 02:55:20] Alice Lafferty: Now now..
[02/01/2023, 02:55:41] Alex Regueiro: Sorry. Cheap jibe. I just happened to think of a joke I heard a few weeks ago!
[02/01/2023, 02:55:52] Alex Regueiro: Which is?
[02/01/2023, 02:56:08] Alice Lafferty: No I literally have dozens of welsh sheep jokes
[02/01/2023, 02:56:19] Alice Lafferty: How does a welshman find a sheep in long grass
[02/01/2023, 02:56:39] Alex Regueiro: Errr
[02/01/2023, 02:56:40] Alex Regueiro: How?
[02/01/2023, 02:56:48] Alice Lafferty: Irresistable
[02/01/2023, 02:57:04] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[02/01/2023, 02:57:31] Alex Regueiro: Actually the joke I was thinking of is more innocent in some way. I'll tell you in person whenever we next see each other!
[02/01/2023, 02:58:16] Alice Lafferty: I guess just kind of very simplistic in a way, compulsive, kind of tendency towards dehumanising the woman in question.
[02/01/2023, 02:59:21] Alex Regueiro: Possibly. There is a stereotype about men just being interested in the physical aspect of relationships, and all the rest is dominance. It's a crude characterisation, but there's a little truth in it for the average man.
[02/01/2023, 02:59:45] Alice Lafferty: Not exactly aggressive, but like narrows in focus very much, like radically reduces my perception of surrounding stimuli.
[02/01/2023, 02:59:58] Alex Regueiro: Right
[02/01/2023, 02:59:59] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I think so
[02/01/2023, 03:00:30] Alex Regueiro: Do you think this view impacts your own reluctance/distrust when it comes to men?
[02/01/2023, 03:00:32] Alice Lafferty: I don't really have a desire to act on it though, which I think is the difference
[02/01/2023, 03:00:36] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, that's a bit forthright of me.
[02/01/2023, 03:01:12] Alex Regueiro: Act on what?
[02/01/2023, 03:01:41] Alice Lafferty: On the contrary - I know that despite that aspect of my sexuality, I also desire like emotional intimacy etc. So I just assume men do too.
[02/01/2023, 03:01:53] Alice Lafferty: But maybe that's not a well-founded assumption.
[02/01/2023, 03:02:37] Alice Lafferty: Like I have literally no desire to initiate sex with a woman
[02/01/2023, 03:02:39] Alex Regueiro: Interesting
[02/01/2023, 03:03:24] Alex Regueiro: No, I think it's actually a well-founded assumption. Maybe the average desire isn't quite as big as women, but a) it depends on the man, b) it definitely increases with age (I think statistics support this too).
[02/01/2023, 03:03:38] Alice Lafferty: I've considered that I have like two discreet masculine/feminine sexualities, and I'm just projecting the feminine part onto straight men :(
[02/01/2023, 03:03:39] Alex Regueiro: Men really want a women to "look after" them or at least "be there for them" emotionally, as they get older.
[02/01/2023, 03:04:06] Alex Regueiro: Ah right. I didn't know you were referring back to that point... thought we'd moved onto male sexuality heh
[02/01/2023, 03:04:25] Alex Regueiro: discrete, you mean, right?
[02/01/2023, 03:04:29] Alice Lafferty: Is this 'romantic love' or is it just like a social need?
[02/01/2023, 03:04:49] Alice Lafferty: Yes, sorryüôÑ
[02/01/2023, 03:05:07] Alex Regueiro: Couldn't resist sorry... as a mathematician who often makes the opposite mistake!
[02/01/2023, 03:05:16] Alex Regueiro: well, sometimes
[02/01/2023, 03:05:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes I assume most men are very motivated to act on their desires
[02/01/2023, 03:05:31] Alex Regueiro: I'm just speaking about a primitive need for care here. But it doesn't preclude a romantic side to it
[02/01/2023, 03:05:43] Alex Regueiro: "care" at an emotional and/or physical level
[02/01/2023, 03:05:44] Alice Lafferty: Which is great, or we wouldn't all be here today...
[02/01/2023, 03:05:55] Alex Regueiro: Haha praying Alice is going strong again today.
[02/01/2023, 03:06:00] Alice Lafferty: Very funny that I keep accidentally prayer-emojing all my messages
[02/01/2023, 03:06:03] Alex Regueiro: Right...
[02/01/2023, 03:06:22] Alice Lafferty: Could another male potentially provide that?
[02/01/2023, 03:06:32] Alex Regueiro: Of all messages to pray-like too...
[02/01/2023, 03:06:43] Alice Lafferty: I know!
[02/01/2023, 03:06:54] Alex Regueiro: I don't think our psychologies have evolved to allow that to the same extent... but in a different way, yes maybe?
[02/01/2023, 03:07:27] Alex Regueiro: What did you mean by this anyway? What do you consider your "masculine sexuality"?
[02/01/2023, 03:07:41] Alice Lafferty: So this seems more like just a need for companionship rather than a sexual/romantic thing.
[02/01/2023, 03:08:18] Alex Regueiro: Just recite 10 Hail Mary's before you go to bed and this sacrilege shall be forgiven. üôèüèº
[02/01/2023, 03:08:20] Alice Lafferty: I mean like, crudely, finding female secondary sex characteristics attractive
[02/01/2023, 03:09:04] Alex Regueiro: Yes, but I mean, I was just highlighting an evo psych side of male sexuality that is not purely about sex or dominance or fathering offspring (the stereotypes).
[02/01/2023, 03:09:09] Alex Regueiro: ohh I see
[02/01/2023, 03:09:11] Alex Regueiro: right
[02/01/2023, 03:09:18] Alex Regueiro: ANIMUS üòâ
[02/01/2023, 03:09:28] Alice Lafferty: I still describe myself as fundamentally straight though. Because a desire dor a romantic relationship with a man is what guides my actions in the real world.
[02/01/2023, 03:10:12] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I think that's fair
[02/01/2023, 03:10:14] Alice Lafferty: Yeah maybe... although it doesn't seem to have a good correlate, eg. men don't seem to have an anima
[02/01/2023, 03:10:27] Alex Regueiro: If this theory is true anyway, then basically no women whatsoever is "straight", right?
[02/01/2023, 03:10:30] Alex Regueiro: So you might as well
[02/01/2023, 03:10:55] Alex Regueiro: Okay now this prayer emoji is appropriate. I mean, the Catholic Church approves!
[02/01/2023, 03:11:05] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I was very much kidding
[02/01/2023, 03:11:15] Alice Lafferty: But I don't know whether this is the case... I would love to talk to another woman about this but it's just too weird a topic to broach
[02/01/2023, 03:11:42] Alice Lafferty: I've got to stop replying to my own messages. That's when it happens.
[02/01/2023, 03:11:52] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Although women tends to talk about this sort of deeply personal thing between themselves much more than men! So in theory, any close friend?
[02/01/2023, 03:12:21] Alice Lafferty: I do not have a huge amount of close female friends...
[02/01/2023, 03:12:48] Alex Regueiro: You're not meant to have a huge number. Two or three is probably average? Maybe 4 max.
[02/01/2023, 03:12:54] Alice Lafferty: None that I'm close enough to be like 'do you ever get turned on by a woman in a bikini?
[02/01/2023, 03:12:56] Alex Regueiro: Depends how you define "close" though"
[02/01/2023, 03:13:11] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair
[02/01/2023, 03:13:16] Alice Lafferty: I think you'd have to be pretty close
[02/01/2023, 03:14:05] Alex Regueiro: In that case I'm honoured that you shared this with me... even though I'm a guy, and you already know my answer to such questions.
[02/01/2023, 03:14:15] Alice Lafferty: There is a kind of 'true female homosexual' ie. a butch lesbian. And I'm confident I'm not one of them.
[02/01/2023, 03:15:05] Alice Lafferty: Haha I just overshare, and it's 3am, and I suspect that men are less judgemental about this stuff
[02/01/2023, 03:15:09] Alex Regueiro: Yep. And I can count on one hand the number of male friends I've had in my entire life I've felt comfortable enough to talk about deeply personal things with (like sexuality). For guys there's even more inhibition though, I'd say
[02/01/2023, 03:16:01] Alice Lafferty: Because some women are genuinely sexually innocent, basically. And would be horrified by this probably.
[02/01/2023, 03:16:03] Alex Regueiro: Ehh, you're meant to say it's because you trust me implicitly and you feel a deep bond of friendship!
[02/01/2023, 03:16:12] Alex Regueiro: üòâ
[02/01/2023, 03:16:27] Alice Lafferty: Really, that's interesting. I thought the 'locker room' culture would have made it quite easy to talk about
[02/01/2023, 03:16:37] Alice Lafferty: That too!
[02/01/2023, 03:17:09] Alex Regueiro: I was never really big in that scene (surprise), but that's more like bragging about 'conquests' or sexual banter.
[02/01/2023, 03:17:36] Alex Regueiro: Not so much genuine and earnest divulging of feelings and urges and whatnot
[02/01/2023, 03:17:39] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, I guess
[02/01/2023, 03:18:00] Alex Regueiro: Hah okay. I believe you. üòí
[02/01/2023, 03:18:05] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I'm confusing it a bit with like male-dominated internet spaces.
[02/01/2023, 03:18:17] Alice Lafferty: Where men often like excavate their sexualities in some detail
[02/01/2023, 03:18:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. The depersonalisation and anonymity of the Internet definitely lowers the natural (and cultural) male inhibitions talking about these things
[02/01/2023, 03:18:50] Alex Regueiro: Not that I've really gone down that rabbit hole of reading such things. But I know they exist.
[02/01/2023, 03:18:55] Alex Regueiro: forums, etc.
[02/01/2023, 03:19:15] Alice Lafferty: Even just on certain parts of twitter.
[02/01/2023, 03:19:26] Alice Lafferty: Men will openly describe their sexual fantasies.
[02/01/2023, 03:19:31] Alex Regueiro: I haven't seen it so much on Twitter, but maybe just because I didn't look?
[02/01/2023, 03:19:39] Alex Regueiro: I see
[02/01/2023, 03:19:41] Alice Lafferty: Maybe this says more about me than it does about them...
[02/01/2023, 03:19:46] Alex Regueiro: haha
[02/01/2023, 03:20:11] Alex Regueiro: Have you actually searched for it? (Fair enough if so!)
[02/01/2023, 03:20:21] Alice Lafferty: No, not at all.
[02/01/2023, 03:20:37] Alex Regueiro: Just been on Twitter enough to see some of the "dark corners" eh?
[02/01/2023, 03:20:43] Alice Lafferty: It just comes part and parcel of being in like, esp rw, political or cultural spaces.
[02/01/2023, 03:20:47] Alex Regueiro: I've seen some weird shit on Twitter to be honest
[02/01/2023, 03:20:48] Alex Regueiro: just not that
[02/01/2023, 03:21:13] Alex Regueiro: Right, makes sense I suppose
[02/01/2023, 03:22:38] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, that has been genuinely pretty fascinating.
[02/01/2023, 03:22:54] Alex Regueiro: Thanks for being candid (as always), as it's actually really insightful
[02/01/2023, 03:22:55] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I was just trawling twitter for an example.
[02/01/2023, 03:23:08] Alice Lafferty: Then I paused and thought: what am I doing, he does not want to see this
[02/01/2023, 03:23:10] Alex Regueiro: At an intellectual level most of all
[02/01/2023, 03:23:11] Alex Regueiro: haha
[02/01/2023, 03:24:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes because I am to free with what should be private information
[02/01/2023, 03:24:23] Alice Lafferty: Oh well, it's not like you're a total stranger or something.
[02/01/2023, 03:24:25] Alex Regueiro: Plus, I know what male fantasies are like eh... a few examples from friends too.
[02/01/2023, 03:24:36] Alice Lafferty: And all of this has intellectual ends of course..
[02/01/2023, 03:24:53] Alice Lafferty: Yeah exactly, teaching grandma to suck eggs
[02/01/2023, 03:25:17] Alex Regueiro: If you feel uncomfortable, you really shouldn't. But like I say it's pretty interesting, even kind of fun, so don't worry. And I've been pretty open too, hopefully? To balance the books
[02/01/2023, 03:25:38] Alex Regueiro: Yes, always 100% intellectual. üëÄ
[02/01/2023, 03:26:00] Alice Lafferty: I am often confused about why you spend time talking to me because I often can't hold a conversation about things you're interested in beyond the soft sciences.
[02/01/2023, 03:26:35] Alice Lafferty: But it is nice of you anyway!
[02/01/2023, 03:27:03] Alex Regueiro: I get this feeling from you too occasionally... from the start... but I don't know how I can make it clearer that I find you both intellectually and personally good company!
[02/01/2023, 03:27:10] Alex Regueiro: online "company" in this case
[02/01/2023, 03:27:32] Alex Regueiro: Plus, I'd just be frittering away time at this hour anyway hah.
[02/01/2023, 03:27:47] Alice Lafferty: Ok good!
[02/01/2023, 03:28:01] Alice Lafferty: You know more than me in almost every domain, so it feels like a net gain for me.
[02/01/2023, 03:28:26] Alex Regueiro: Not true, even if I do have the "wisdom of age" on my side. But thanks anyway.
[02/01/2023, 03:29:42] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to catch up very fast with the physics lectures I watch on youtube... it will leave your 4 year degree from Imperial in the dust...
[02/01/2023, 03:29:43] Alex Regueiro: At the risk of sounding a bit mushy, it's been years since I met someone as exciting/fun to talk to as you!
[02/01/2023, 03:29:50] Alex Regueiro: Friend or otherwise
[02/01/2023, 03:29:55] Alice Lafferty: So watch out for that....
[02/01/2023, 03:30:04] Alex Regueiro: Haha sounds good
[02/01/2023, 03:30:12] Alex Regueiro: Tell me which ones they are though, I'm curious!
[02/01/2023, 03:30:28] Alice Lafferty: We have breached mushiness levelüÜòüÜòüÜò
[02/01/2023, 03:30:29] Alex Regueiro: I'd actually strongly recommend the Feynman lectures for you.
[02/01/2023, 03:30:39] Alex Regueiro: Hahah
[02/01/2023, 03:30:58] Alex Regueiro: But at least it lets you know that I'm definitely not humouring you in the slightest by spending time chatting!
[02/01/2023, 03:31:00] Alice Lafferty: But thank you and same to you!
[02/01/2023, 03:31:38] Alex Regueiro: Also, only 3 years. I converted down. So it's doable!
[02/01/2023, 03:31:52] Alice Lafferty: I think it will be fun if I can come to the salon and see you in action in a debate too
[02/01/2023, 03:32:02] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I'm really looking forward to that üòÄ
[02/01/2023, 03:32:21] Alex Regueiro: Seeing what you make of it all and what your contributions are (though don't feel pressure to speak too much)
[02/01/2023, 03:32:45] Alice Lafferty: I've seem these recommended before actually!
[02/01/2023, 03:33:05] Alice Lafferty: So yes I will start there and look up supporting information as I go along.
[02/01/2023, 03:33:16] Alice Lafferty: *seen
[02/01/2023, 03:33:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, they're ideal for someone smart with a lot of curiosity but who hasn't yet begun undergraduate studies.
[02/01/2023, 03:34:05] Alice Lafferty: We'll se what my aptitude for proper physics is like
[02/01/2023, 03:34:19] Alice Lafferty: Ok are you going to bed now?
[02/01/2023, 03:34:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm equally curious about that. Always feel free to come to me for advice/help on that (and maths).
[02/01/2023, 03:34:34] Alex Regueiro: I was just going to say yeah...
[02/01/2023, 03:34:46] Alex Regueiro: Time to get something to eat and watch something briefly, then bed
[02/01/2023, 03:34:51] Alice Lafferty: Thanksüëç
[02/01/2023, 03:34:59] Alice Lafferty: Ok, good night

[02/01/2023, 03:35:47] Alex Regueiro: Good night. And let me know tomorrow about the BFI dates and whatnot. üôÇ
[02/01/2023, 03:36:15] Alice Lafferty: Isn't there a borat skit (or similar?) like this.
[02/01/2023, 03:36:38] Alex Regueiro: Hah might be. Link me if you happen to find it!
[02/01/2023, 03:36:42] Alex Regueiro: Sweet dreams
[02/01/2023, 03:38:59] Alice Lafferty: It was about identifying the 'Jew claw' or something. I will try to find it
[02/01/2023, 03:39:05] Alice Lafferty: And yes I will
[02/01/2023, 14:40:36] Alex Regueiro: üëçüèº to both

[03/01/2023, 19:33:16] Alice Lafferty: Did you decide to see Fanny & Alexander tonight in the end?
[03/01/2023, 19:33:24] Alice Lafferty: *that was today, right?
[03/01/2023, 19:33:41] Alice Lafferty: Peculiar...
[03/01/2023, 19:34:36] Alice Lafferty: I actually got a really nice book about cathedrals for Christmas.
‚Äé[03/01/2023, 19:34:45] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[03/01/2023, 19:35:57] Alice Lafferty: Also sorry for leading you into that bizarre conversation the other day. I shouldn't assume everyone has the same level as openness as me. I just found it interesting.
[03/01/2023, 19:42:18] Alex Regueiro: Ah cool
[03/01/2023, 19:42:43] Alex Regueiro: That's lovely. You'll have to tell me about it. üôÇ
[03/01/2023, 19:42:57] Alex Regueiro: Many English ones? I'm guessing mainly European in any case
[03/01/2023, 19:43:38] Alex Regueiro: No. It was a bit too soon for me as well. But I'm definitely keen on one of the Kurosawa ones! Did you have a preference? If not I can decide.
[03/01/2023, 19:44:47] Alex Regueiro: Oh, don't be silly, it was a little bizarre, but moreover interesting/fun!
[03/01/2023, 19:45:18] Alex Regueiro: And your openness is one of the things I like about you. Hopefully I was being open too. Maybe it comes less naturally to me, but I certainly try. üôÇ
[03/01/2023, 21:24:24] Alice Lafferty: It has sections on Wells, Salisbury & York Minster, which are the best English ones imo. But yes mostly French.
[03/01/2023, 21:26:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok, after just a brief look I was drawn most strongly to 'Ikiru'. But they all look good, and you should definitely pick as I'm less invested in him as a filmmaker.
[03/01/2023, 21:28:03] Alex Regueiro: Very good. I've not actually been to Wells, but Salisbury is magnificent. York I only went to many years ago...
[03/01/2023, 21:28:24] Alex Regueiro: Surprised they don't have Canterbury and maybe Lincoln and Winchester too though.
[03/01/2023, 21:28:39] Alex Regueiro: French üò§
[03/01/2023, 21:29:42] Alice Lafferty: They did invent Gothic, you have to hand it to them!
[03/01/2023, 21:29:58] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good. Suitably existential and grim for the team of year! I don't think I've actually seen it as well...
[03/01/2023, 21:30:00] Alice Lafferty: Sorry they did have Canterbury too.
[03/01/2023, 21:30:17] Alice Lafferty: I think just to include the story about Thomas Beckett.
[03/01/2023, 21:30:22] Alex Regueiro: True. While ironically they didn't really invent the "Norman" style. Not the fundamental form.
[03/01/2023, 21:30:41] Alex Regueiro: Presumably a few German ones too, like Aachen?
[03/01/2023, 21:31:22] Alice Lafferty: Right, didn't romanesque architecture move up from Spain into France?
[03/01/2023, 21:31:50] Alex Regueiro: I think it Italian originally, no? Could be wrong
[03/01/2023, 21:32:03] Alex Regueiro: Based on ancient Roman architecture, at least in a loose way
[03/01/2023, 21:32:58] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah sorry, from Italy *via Spain. I think it was formalised in Spain though
[03/01/2023, 21:33:08] Alex Regueiro: That would make sense
[03/01/2023, 21:37:15] Alex Regueiro: I'm guessing there are one or two northern Italian cathedrals too? At least the Duomo of Milan.
[03/01/2023, 21:37:49] Alex Regueiro: Oh, it's more than just Gothic...
[03/01/2023, 21:41:15] Alex Regueiro: There are loads of English ones they could have included, come to think of it. St Paul's, Westminster Abbey, Lincoln, Durham... But a book can only be so long eh!
[06/01/2023, 02:39:24] Alice Lafferty: It's very Gothic heavy as that is the golden age of the cathedral.
[06/01/2023, 02:40:10] Alice Lafferty: To be honest now that I'm reading it, it's actually a bit light on architecture and kind of personality-focused.
[06/01/2023, 02:42:47] Alice Lafferty: Yes and Florence
[06/01/2023, 02:43:45] Alice Lafferty: There are actually no post-Reformation cathedrals included (probably because architecturally not that stunning).. not even St Paul's
[06/01/2023, 02:44:57] Alice Lafferty: By the way I read your space exploration essay. The formatting produced some kind of funny sentences!
‚Äé[06/01/2023, 02:45:14] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[06/01/2023, 02:46:17] Alice Lafferty: It was very interesting, although I guess I was surprised that you weren't required to go into more detail on the fuel types.
[06/01/2023, 15:49:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, fair enough. There are some magnificent ones outside of that era though. I mean, it's sort of a crime not to include St Paul's, unless you're explicitly sticking to medieval, right?
[06/01/2023, 15:49:59] Alex Regueiro: Or St Peter's Basilica
[06/01/2023, 15:50:06] Alex Regueiro: or the Hagia Sofia
[06/01/2023, 15:50:56] Alex Regueiro: Florence's Duomo I've seen in person, and it's magnificent. Not Gothic, but one of the pinnacles of Renaissance architecture for sure!
[06/01/2023, 15:52:22] Alex Regueiro: I have an affinity for the Gothic aesthetic, but some of the Romanesque, Byzantine, and Renaissance architecture is equally impressive, it has to be said...
[06/01/2023, 15:52:56] Alex Regueiro: Haha. The Alexander Regueiro engine... I didn't even know I'd invented it!
[06/01/2023, 15:54:17] Alex Regueiro: You're quite right, I should have included more physics, and my tutor actually said as much, even though the mark was pretty good. I suppose I got carried away with the futurism side of it. Plus, 19 year old me had a very meagre understanding of physics!
[06/01/2023, 15:56:59] Alex Regueiro: Coincidentally, I was reading about the Elisabethkirche in Marburg a couple of days ago. Apparently the first wholly Gothic church in Germany. Has a great deal of history behind it too.
[06/01/2023, 15:57:58] Alex Regueiro: I also read this article the other day, which you might like. üôÇ Pretty informative, and not politicised like the National Trust and English Heritage so love to do these days.
[06/01/2023, 15:57:59] Alex Regueiro: https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/histories/dissolution/?fbclid=IwAR0lZNWJQOdV50ajn6oSOL5OV1ZJDuC1hRmP-bIr_6UlPyZordQGxeo1Miw
[08/01/2023, 22:50:41] Alice Lafferty: This is included
[08/01/2023, 22:51:47] Alice Lafferty: I'm sorry for being so slow with replying recently, I've been doing hermit stuff.
[08/01/2023, 23:13:23] Alex Regueiro: Phew. I'm just trying to poke holes in it after being miffed Lincoln wasn't included! But in honesty it sounds great.
[08/01/2023, 23:13:52] Alex Regueiro: No worries. As long as everything is alright. Any interesting hermit stuff?
[11/01/2023, 23:51:03] Alex Regueiro: Hey Alice. Everything alright with you? Do tell me if not. We don't have to chat, but I did feel like I ought to check!
[12/01/2023, 09:23:03] Alice Lafferty: I'm OK, thanks. I find the new year period difficult. How are you? 

Sorry again for not getting back to you, it's not personal! Would still like to tell you more about the cathedral book (if interested) and also talk about the Feynman lectures.
[12/01/2023, 17:49:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I sympathise. I'm doing well enough this year, but I've found it rough in the past. So easy to fall into a bit of a depression or a rut.
[12/01/2023, 17:49:37] Alex Regueiro: Feel free to share, or not. Whatever helps.
[12/01/2023, 17:49:52] Alex Regueiro: Oh, it's quite alright. I know it wasn't personal. üôÇ
[12/01/2023, 17:53:35] Alex Regueiro: Just Alice the Anchoress, you could say?!
[12/01/2023, 17:53:46] Alex Regueiro: And yeah, I'm keen to hear your thoughts on either! So please share anything you find interesting.
[16/01/2023, 01:13:13] Alex Regueiro: https://thecritic.co.uk/reparations-and-the-rectory/
[16/01/2023, 01:15:19] Alex Regueiro: Shall we laugh or weep at this?
[16/01/2023, 01:16:09] Alex Regueiro: They must be having a party at the Vatican every time the C of E does something like this! Or maybe it's all their psy-op. ü§î
[16/01/2023, 01:16:31] Alex Regueiro: Speaking of the Vatican, I started watching The Two Popes a few days ago. Have you seen it?
[16/01/2023, 01:19:55] Alex Regueiro: In brief... I didn't know a film with Anthony Hopkins in it could possibly be so awful. Forget proper theological debate, the dialogue is hilariously teenaged in both tone and intellectual weight. Honestly, I couldn't believe it was so glibly ideological (despite the current zeitgeist).
[16/01/2023, 01:21:21] Alex Regueiro: I suspect if you showed it to an actual Catholic theologian he might be forced to officially declare it anathema!
[16/01/2023, 01:23:32] Alex Regueiro: (Or can only the Pope do that? Still...)
[16/01/2023, 01:24:25] Alex Regueiro: Oh, by the way, have you watched either of those series I recommended? üôÇ No rush, just curious.
[16/01/2023, 01:26:04] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, I did check out the screening times for the Kurosawa stuff... we can chat about that whenever you feel up for it. Hope you're doing a little better the past few days anyway. Good night. x
[17/01/2023, 08:08:21] Alice Lafferty: I haven't seen it! I've been meaning too for ages though because I am quite a big fan of Benedict XVI! I am more ambivalent about Francis's work. Although this movie looks more personality driven?
‚Äé[17/01/2023, 08:10:03] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[17/01/2023, 08:11:35] Alice Lafferty: That bad? I would guess biased towards 'huggy eco-friendly Francis' (although interestingly he is really nowhere near as liberal as the secular media has made him out to be...)
[17/01/2023, 08:24:56] Alice Lafferty: Classic Welbyüëå
[17/01/2023, 08:29:45] Alice Lafferty: Ha, but to be fair this is kind of PR stuff is really business as usual for most established churches, not just the CofE. The Vatican also 'gives audiences' to sexual abuse victims but no heads have ever actually rolled for that scandal... Also I think the comparison made to the selling of indulges is not quite right.
[17/01/2023, 08:30:05] Alice Lafferty: But thank you for sharing the article, and I apologise for not getting back to you earlier. Je suis back now.
[17/01/2023, 08:33:30] Alice Lafferty: Thank you for your messages, I appreciate them. Sorry for not getting back to you about the films, are there still any coming up?If so, I am free all weekday evenings this week? If not, I hope you got to see one by yourself.
[17/01/2023, 15:43:02] Alex Regueiro: Very much personality driven. It's just so facile though. Two very good actors in the lead roles, just wasted by an awful script and blatantly ideological plot. (Liberal progressive pope good, traditional intellectual pope bad!)
[17/01/2023, 15:43:45] Alex Regueiro: I don't even dislike Papa Francesco (his actual views and personality seem much more nuanced than this film portrays) but yeah...
[17/01/2023, 15:45:13] Alex Regueiro: Haha. I wonder if JP has seen this. Without being religious, I can sympathise with Benedict here... there's something a bit Last-Mannish about the Jungian archetypal reading.
[17/01/2023, 15:46:36] Alex Regueiro: I always hear good things about Benedict from anyone who has a proper understanding of hermeneutics or theology. He was evidently a real heavyweight.
[17/01/2023, 15:48:32] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's true. Though the Vatican has done the bare minimum in response to the scandal, I'd say. Sort of in keeping with their history. And yes, it's qualitatively very different to the selling of indulgences.
[17/01/2023, 15:49:50] Alex Regueiro: I also think you'd quite enjoy the last chapter of The Revolt of the Elites (Lasch), which I finally completed last week. Interesting take on religion in modern society.
[17/01/2023, 15:51:30] Alex Regueiro: No worries, really. But glad to hear... Habemus Aliciam. üôåüèº
[17/01/2023, 16:00:47] Alex Regueiro: Super. Okay, there's:
Rashomon tomorrow at 18:15
High and Low this Thursday at 17:45
The Idiot (Dostoyevsky adaptation) Saturday at 16:50
Sanjuro on Thursday the 26th
Seven Samurai on Saturday the 28th

Do any of those appeal? üôÇ
[17/01/2023, 23:20:50] Alice Lafferty: Hm, maybe make a good hate watch then?
[17/01/2023, 23:23:28] Alice Lafferty: He was, probably (the?) major Catholic thinker of the 2nd half of last century. I think his conservatism is quite understandable given that lived through the Second Vatican Council.
[17/01/2023, 23:23:30] Alice Lafferty: His 'Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life' is really good if you're interested.
[17/01/2023, 23:24:20] Alice Lafferty: Yeeah this largely falls to Benedict as wellüò¨
[17/01/2023, 23:24:56] Alice Lafferty: Lasch has been on my reading list for years now.. I may just try and read an online pdf.
[17/01/2023, 23:25:37] Alice Lafferty: Did you find it good overall?
[17/01/2023, 23:26:22] Alice Lafferty: Ah I missed Ikiru it seems
[17/01/2023, 23:27:26] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes if you fancy. I'm not sure I quite get the phenomenon myself though... just can't do it!
[17/01/2023, 23:27:49] Alex Regueiro: Thanks, good to know. Is it fairly accessible to the non-theologian?
[17/01/2023, 23:28:24] Alex Regueiro: Yep... and I know that Aussie cardinal died recently after his conviction was overturned (on a technicality?)
[17/01/2023, 23:29:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it was a really interesting book. 2/3 of the chapters were very strong. The rest were a bit weaker, but not devoid of all merit.
[17/01/2023, 23:29:34] Alice Lafferty: Eh, maybe to a very motivated non-theologian? It's kind of dense
[17/01/2023, 23:29:37] Alice Lafferty: In places
[17/01/2023, 23:29:38] Alex Regueiro: So definitely recommended. His Marxist past creeps through occasionally, usually in stubborn anti-capitalist rhetoric. But overall he's very fair.
[17/01/2023, 23:30:33] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, sorry. So there's two showings of that, and the first I think you'll be away, but maybe the second on 11th Feb?
[17/01/2023, 23:30:41] Alex Regueiro: haha okay
[17/01/2023, 23:31:07] Alice Lafferty: It's interesting though.. he makes heaven, hell and purgatory into permanent existential states on earth rather than occurring before/after death.
[17/01/2023, 23:31:36] Alex Regueiro: How curious. That sounds decidedly non-traditionalist!
[17/01/2023, 23:32:11] Alice Lafferty: Yeah even he did not escape the modern theological tendency to essentially backpeddle and sort of de-formalise every piece of dogma. But it's very well done.
[17/01/2023, 23:32:47] Alice Lafferty: Ok, that's interesting.
[17/01/2023, 23:33:40] Alice Lafferty: Was that right that Sanjuro is on Thursday 26th?
[17/01/2023, 23:33:59] Alex Regueiro: I just ordered a book by Chantal Delsol incidentally, which seems to overlap a decent amount in ideology with Lasch, although comes more from skeptical conservative-liberal background, from what I can tell.
[17/01/2023, 23:34:31] Alex Regueiro: Yup
[17/01/2023, 23:34:32] Alice Lafferty: I've never read her..
[17/01/2023, 23:34:50] Alex Regueiro: Nor have I. Just happened upon her stuff by chance, but she looks like an exciting thinker.
[17/01/2023, 23:34:52] Alice Lafferty: What recommended her to you?
[17/01/2023, 23:35:00] Alex Regueiro: The book has good reviews
[17/01/2023, 23:35:05] Alex Regueiro: Honestly don't remember...
[17/01/2023, 23:35:42] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see. Looks right up your alley
[17/01/2023, 23:35:49] Alice Lafferty: Liberal-conservatism I mean
[17/01/2023, 23:36:04] Alice Lafferty: Please let me know how you find it
[17/01/2023, 23:37:27] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. I want to see a modern theologian fully embrace Dante's vision of hell. Literal burning pits of sulphur, walking endlessly in circles, and being stuck in Satan's mouth for eternity!
[17/01/2023, 23:38:08] Alice Lafferty: Haha, that would definitely ring the changes.
[17/01/2023, 23:38:22] Alice Lafferty: In a way though I find abstracted versions of hell more terrifying in a way...
[17/01/2023, 23:39:29] Alex Regueiro: Will do, definitely. And yeah, I'm not sure I'll agree with everything, but all her views seem to be well informed and developed from that what I can tell. I still consider myself in the vague sphere of liberal-conservatism. I sympathise a lot with populists like Lasch, which maybe draws me away from the former a little... but not entirely.
[17/01/2023, 23:39:43] Alex Regueiro: I know what you mean. Isn't the Jewish idea of "hell" rather more abstract?
[17/01/2023, 23:40:13] Alice Lafferty: Physical pain is one thing, but some post Schleiermacher stuff is just so penetratingly horrorifying, like pure abjection.
[17/01/2023, 23:40:20] Alice Lafferty: *horrorifying ? Yeah
[17/01/2023, 23:40:50] Alice Lafferty: Rabbinical Judaism doesn't strictly comment on the afterlife.
[17/01/2023, 23:41:20] Alice Lafferty: 'Gehenna' just refers to the physical location of burial sites outside Jerusalem.
[17/01/2023, 23:41:26] Alex Regueiro: Nothing in the Talmud eh?
[17/01/2023, 23:41:28] Alex Regueiro: I see...
[17/01/2023, 23:41:57] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of like the kenosis theology I mentioned once, sort of defined by absence.
[17/01/2023, 23:41:59] Alex Regueiro: As in, the theologians that came after Schleiermacher? I don't know anything about him I'm afraid.
[17/01/2023, 23:42:46] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, he was like a watershed  figure for liberalising Christianity a bit.
[17/01/2023, 23:43:49] Alex Regueiro: Well I'm a little curious for sure, but I won't ask you to elaborate on this right now at the risk of dragging you back down into gloom hah.
[17/01/2023, 23:44:43] Alice Lafferty: Obviously there's lots of talmudic commentary but it's very mystical and refrains from making any comments that anyone could be held to!
[17/01/2023, 23:45:56] Alice Lafferty: To be fair though I'm much more familiar with second temple Judaism than I am with any of its modern iterations.
[17/01/2023, 23:46:26] Alice Lafferty: Haha, like I said it's largely sophistry anyway.
[17/01/2023, 23:47:00] Alice Lafferty: The analogies are beautiful but vacuous
[17/01/2023, 23:47:26] Alice Lafferty: * like all theology...
[17/01/2023, 23:47:29] Alex Regueiro: That doesn't surprise me. I get the impression a lot of theologians and talmudic scholars are expert fence-sitters and mystical stylists above all! üòâ
[17/01/2023, 23:47:40] Alex Regueiro: Hah yep, I won't argue there either
[17/01/2023, 23:48:19] Alex Regueiro: It's nice feeling liberated to freely cast aspersions on theology now that you've abandoned it eh?
[17/01/2023, 23:48:39] Alex Regueiro: Makes sense, since that was the context in which Christianity arose.
[17/01/2023, 23:48:57] Alice Lafferty: Yeah they're some of the most talented writers history has ever seen. But it's not substantial.
[17/01/2023, 23:49:15] Alex Regueiro: Honestly a lot of philosophy is like that too, I've come to see.
[17/01/2023, 23:49:28] Alex Regueiro: Far from all, but a great deal.
[17/01/2023, 23:50:02] Alice Lafferty: * continental philosophy
[17/01/2023, 23:50:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes! I still think it has _some_ value as a pursuit, and it will so long as there are religious people.
[17/01/2023, 23:51:20] Alice Lafferty: Some of it's kind of ingenious too
[17/01/2023, 23:52:33] Alice Lafferty: But yeah I've read whole books/200 page long papers that have a beautiful compelling internal logic.
[17/01/2023, 23:52:49] Alice Lafferty: But which just fall apart instantly on contact with reality.
[17/01/2023, 23:53:11] Alex Regueiro: Yeah mainly but also some analytic. Easy for it to degenerate into high-faluting pettifoggery that has zero relevance to anything wordly.
[17/01/2023, 23:54:46] Alice Lafferty: The fact that ordinary 'uneducated' people have always been able to derive values and jog along quite well without the help of a philosophy department is really damning actually.
[17/01/2023, 23:55:20] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's a purely intellectual 'game'.
[17/01/2023, 23:55:28] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely. I wouldn't want to discount it entirely. It just has limited import to wider modern society perhaps.
[17/01/2023, 23:56:16] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's the issue. It can so easily slide into pure fantasy land. Deep reflection platonic ideals up in ivory towers!
[17/01/2023, 23:56:20] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I although think it had little import to pre-modern societies either...
[17/01/2023, 23:56:31] Alex Regueiro: So can some pure mathematics actually, which is what worries me more even...
[17/01/2023, 23:56:33] Alice Lafferty: Somewhat contrary to what we imagine, liturgy is prior to doctrine.
[17/01/2023, 23:56:44] Alice Lafferty: It has always been that way.
[17/01/2023, 23:57:14] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. And this sounds scarily like some pure maths...
[17/01/2023, 23:57:23] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[17/01/2023, 23:58:18] Alex Regueiro: Makes sense. Possibly reflects the average person's need for practical life philosophy plus some ritual rather than abstract philosophy games eh?
[17/01/2023, 23:59:12] Alice Lafferty: I wonder how many guys there are in universities trying to solve some obscure puzzle when their brains could be applied to like, delivering fusion energyüòê.
[17/01/2023, 23:59:27] Alice Lafferty: Bit utilitarian of me
[17/01/2023, 23:59:36] Alice Lafferty: But
[17/01/2023, 23:59:36] Alex Regueiro: I feel like some Christian denominations reinforce that idea. They don't dwell too much on theology beyond the basics, and insist everyday Christianity is more pragmatic.
[18/01/2023, 00:00:08] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. I've wondered the same. And worse, just think of all the brainpower wasted on abstruse theology and philosophy throughout the Middle Ages!
[18/01/2023, 00:00:16] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[18/01/2023, 00:00:31] Alice Lafferty: To be fair, this is what Catholicism used to be good at.
[18/01/2023, 00:00:50] Alice Lafferty: It was really Luther who brought the burden of interpretation down on the layman.
[18/01/2023, 00:00:55] Alex Regueiro: Still, I'm not entirely practically-oriented. I do think there's some truth to ars gratia artis, for any sort of "art"!
[18/01/2023, 00:01:10] Alex Regueiro: Interesting
[18/01/2023, 00:01:56] Alice Lafferty: To be fair there was a lot of natural science going on as well. They were just required to tag 'and The Lord God made it so' at the end of their work.
[18/01/2023, 00:01:58] Alex Regueiro: Was that connected to the layman's immediate access to the Bible, do you think? Rather than just sermons and a more arm's-length relationship with scripture?
[18/01/2023, 00:02:37] Alex Regueiro: There was, and some of it was wonderfully nurtured by the church, at the same time as contaminating it with dogma...
[18/01/2023, 00:02:44] Alice Lafferty: Yes, Latin - vernacular mass. Sort of pulling down the curtain at the Emerald City..
[18/01/2023, 00:02:58] Alice Lafferty: * Latin -> vernacular mass
[18/01/2023, 00:03:17] Alex Regueiro: I recently read a nice little anecdote about Newton's views about the stability of the orbital system of our Solar System...
[18/01/2023, 00:04:00] Alex Regueiro: Right. Kept the people in thrall to some extent, though I don't think most minded it half as much as Luther thought they did?
[18/01/2023, 00:04:52] Alice Lafferty: Link?
[18/01/2023, 00:05:02] Alice Lafferty: He was into all kinds of weird stuff though
[18/01/2023, 00:05:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh I can tell just it to you...
[18/01/2023, 00:05:31] Alex Regueiro: This is atually what Laplace worked a bit on too, a century later roughly. (The theologian-turned-mathematician!)
[18/01/2023, 00:05:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah he was
[18/01/2023, 00:05:44] Alex Regueiro: this isn't so heretical or odd, just...
[18/01/2023, 00:06:35] Alex Regueiro: Well, basically he realised (correctly) that there's nothing guaranteeing the stability of the orbits of the planets in the solar system. In the sense that we can't really predict whether there will be some configuration of positions and velocities at some point in the future after which one planet just flies off into the abyss!
[18/01/2023, 00:06:48] Alex Regueiro: This is sort of the first glimpses of chaos theory, you could say.
[18/01/2023, 00:06:53] Alex Regueiro: And this concerned Newton
[18/01/2023, 00:07:30] Alex Regueiro: Because stability and a nice orderly solar system is obviously desirable at several levels (some for the sake of science, some just human prejudice)
[18/01/2023, 00:07:31] Alex Regueiro: Anyway
[18/01/2023, 00:07:41] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, he thought it was God providing stability?
[18/01/2023, 00:07:59] Alex Regueiro: His conclusion was to accept the solar system is probably inherently instable, but that God would occasionally "nudge" planets to keep the orbits nice and stable
[18/01/2023, 00:08:00] Alex Regueiro: Yup
[18/01/2023, 00:08:26] Alice Lafferty: Haha, very sweet
[18/01/2023, 00:08:41] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'd almost rather believe this than chaos theory too hah
[18/01/2023, 00:08:44] Alice Lafferty: What is the actual reason?
[18/01/2023, 00:09:07] Alex Regueiro: Well, he was actually right... we still can't guarantee the solar system will be forever stable!
[18/01/2023, 00:09:26] Alex Regueiro: We just elaborate on this situation with tools from chaos theory.
[18/01/2023, 00:10:25] Alice Lafferty: I privately suspect as much. 
'I'm going to bring the people justification through faith!'
The people: üòê
[18/01/2023, 00:10:49] Alex Regueiro: One of the most amazing things Newton did that's also an intersection of religious studies and science is his calculation of the exact date on which Jesus was crucified. I find that astounding, for a man of his time, with no real calculators or computers, and a limited knowledge of astronomy (much which he helped to advance).
[18/01/2023, 00:11:05] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah.
[18/01/2023, 00:11:25] Alice Lafferty: Oh, but what sort of probability are we looking at that it would have remained stable for so long?
[18/01/2023, 00:11:36] Alex Regueiro: Oh Luther... such an interesting character though. I presume you know about his anti-Jewish ravings the last few years of his life?
[18/01/2023, 00:11:38] Alice Lafferty: Ah I didn't know about this
[18/01/2023, 00:11:55] Alex Regueiro: Or his troublesome blasphemous thoughts that he wrote in his diary?
[18/01/2023, 00:12:12] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes the 'dogs' stuff.
[18/01/2023, 00:12:13] Alex Regueiro: That's the thing, we can't even make a probability distribution really
[18/01/2023, 00:14:30] Alice Lafferty: I have to say I don't understand why should orbits be unstable.
[18/01/2023, 00:14:31] Alex Regueiro: He was plagued by images of the devil's arse, it would seem!
[18/01/2023, 00:14:37] Alex Regueiro: https://pastordaveonline.org/2018/12/21/luthers-psychological-state/
[18/01/2023, 00:15:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's really not obvious, but you the picture we're given at school is greatly oversimplified, we must remember. There are constantly gravitational interactions between different planets (and moons to a lesser extent). And the orbits of planets "precess" on long time scales.
[18/01/2023, 00:16:11] Alice Lafferty: Oh wow. You'll be surprised to hear this didn't end up on the curriculum. I knew he was intense.
[18/01/2023, 00:16:37] Alice Lafferty: Reminds me of Augustine in that he invented doctrines which directly served to soothe his particular neurosis.
[18/01/2023, 00:16:49] Alice Lafferty: Like unambiguously so.
[18/01/2023, 00:16:52] Alex Regueiro: Small deviations in conditions now could easily make the difference between nice and orderly elliptical orbits and one planet suddenly doing some weird little jig and getting ejected into interstellar space!
[18/01/2023, 00:17:00] Alex Regueiro: Haha I see
[18/01/2023, 00:17:12] Alex Regueiro: I did get the impression Augustine was a very odd character though
[18/01/2023, 00:17:37] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, and his compulsive confessions at some ludicrous frequency to the point he'd just piss off all the priests haha.
[18/01/2023, 00:17:49] Alice Lafferty: Are the conditions in our solar system very changeable?
[18/01/2023, 00:18:00] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean "conditions"?
[18/01/2023, 00:18:34] Alice Lafferty: *'small deviations in conditions' - do you mean ambient space/ interactions with other celestial bodies?
[18/01/2023, 00:19:14] Alice Lafferty: Yes very. He suffered from sexual guilt, for example.
[18/01/2023, 00:19:37] Alex Regueiro: Before I forget... let me know if you fancy any of these. Honestly they're all first-rate films, so we can't go wrong, and I'd enjoy them all. Not sure if the 26th/28th is when you're away skiing, but I think those work with me too.
[18/01/2023, 00:20:13] Alice Lafferty: Bleh my parents are asleep. I will check with them and I promise I will get back to you by tomorrow.
[18/01/2023, 00:20:55] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I mean it in the technical sense. Small deviations in what the actual "configuration state" of the planets is. Like positions, velocities, masses. In theory it's all 100% deterministic, but you would need infinite precision of measurement for that (and infinite computational power), so in actuality, not really...
[18/01/2023, 00:21:16] Alex Regueiro: No problem. Rashomon is tomorrow but the others aren't so urgent. üôÇ
[18/01/2023, 00:21:21] Alex Regueiro: Do you know when you leave or not sure?
[18/01/2023, 00:22:27] Alice Lafferty: I see. What is it that causes a planet to eg. not meet its predicted position in an orbit by a particular time, even by a small margin?
[18/01/2023, 00:22:40] Alice Lafferty: Is it stuff like asteroids?
[18/01/2023, 00:23:22] Alice Lafferty: I know that their velocity increases at different parts of the ellipse, but obviously that would be accounted for.
[18/01/2023, 00:23:26] Alex Regueiro: I mean, just the fact he had several lives before his momentous conversion... all sorts of crime. Not a stable character, to put it mildly!
[18/01/2023, 00:23:30] Alex Regueiro: Boethius on the other hand...
[18/01/2023, 00:24:21] Alex Regueiro: It's just the way the constant interactions (modelled by differential equations) can lead to vastly divergent evolutions of the system in the long term.
[18/01/2023, 00:25:17] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps an easier example to appreciate is the double pendulum. There are actually some cool web pages where you can place around with simulations for yourself and see how minute differences in initial setup of the system leads to completely different behaviour 10 seconds or so later.
[18/01/2023, 00:25:36] Alice Lafferty: I don't know about his personal life - I've only read De Trinitate
[18/01/2023, 00:25:41] Alice Lafferty: What was he up to?
[18/01/2023, 00:26:06] Alice Lafferty: Ohh I know what you're talking about.
[18/01/2023, 00:26:08] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I just mean he seems much more consistent across his life, and stoical, given how he met his end and what he wrote in prison.
[18/01/2023, 00:26:11] Alex Regueiro: Cumulative effects over time...
[18/01/2023, 00:26:32] Alex Regueiro: Each small in its own, but ultimately causing enormous divergence
[18/01/2023, 00:26:44] Alex Regueiro: not always, but there's that possibility, and it's super difficult to model mathematically
[18/01/2023, 00:26:58] Alex Regueiro: Butterfly effect and all that jazz... which you've surely heard of
[18/01/2023, 00:27:18] Alice Lafferty: Wtf so science can't always make accurate predictions based on previous experimental resultsüò≥
[18/01/2023, 00:27:27] Alice Lafferty: 'You're telling me this for the first time...'
[18/01/2023, 00:27:33] Alex Regueiro: hahah
[18/01/2023, 00:27:48] Alex Regueiro: Right!
[18/01/2023, 00:27:51] Alex Regueiro: It's all a big cover up
[18/01/2023, 00:27:55] Alex Regueiro: Don't tell anyone
[18/01/2023, 00:28:34] Alex Regueiro: Or these ignorant politicos might stop funding frivolous experiments üòû
[18/01/2023, 00:28:36] Alice Lafferty: But sometimes (often?) accurate predictions _can_ be made.
[18/01/2023, 00:28:47] Alex Regueiro: Yes. There are lots of systems that aren't chaotic at all
[18/01/2023, 00:28:57] Alice Lafferty: Are some systems inherently more chaotic than others
[18/01/2023, 00:29:01] Alex Regueiro: Or are only chaotic in a small domain (subset of their phase space)
[18/01/2023, 00:29:03] Alice Lafferty: Oh right hahap
[18/01/2023, 00:29:09] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely
[18/01/2023, 00:29:28] Alex Regueiro: Like, the double pendulum is inherently very chaotic, whereas the single pendulum is totally predictable, not remotely chaotic.
[18/01/2023, 00:30:00] Alex Regueiro: Have you perused Feynman's Lectures yet, incidentally? Just curious!
[18/01/2023, 00:30:04] Alice Lafferty: Weird because double pendulum on its face is deceptively simple, compared to like, a combustion engine.
[18/01/2023, 00:30:55] Alice Lafferty: Yet the latter can be tracked (fairly) precisely?
[18/01/2023, 00:30:57] Alex Regueiro: Yes indeed. To describe the setup is not hard. It's a remarkably simple system in some ways. That's why it's a prototypical chaotic system really. Same with the solar system to a significant degree.
[18/01/2023, 00:31:31] Alex Regueiro: Yes, totally. The motion is simple in its mathematical form. Regularly periodic.
[18/01/2023, 00:32:28] Alice Lafferty: Not properly yet. I had them on in the background whilst knitting for a while but I realised wasn't really listening to them. Have only listened to one properly. Introduced to probability amplitudes!
[18/01/2023, 00:33:42] Alex Regueiro: Nice video if you're curious BTW. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1-cwamhwag (don't feel obliged)
[18/01/2023, 00:33:53] Alice Lafferty: So it is mysterious how any ordered complex system can arise at all. Do we actually have an explanation which bests Newton's?
[18/01/2023, 00:34:11] Alex Regueiro: And just ignore the cheesy forced jokes... she's German, so we can forgive her.
[18/01/2023, 00:34:17] Alex Regueiro: Great science communicator though
[18/01/2023, 00:34:33] Alice Lafferty: Haha thank you
[18/01/2023, 00:34:41] Alex Regueiro: Ah that's a fun one though, I imagine.
[18/01/2023, 00:34:53] Alice Lafferty: This is interesting to me.
[18/01/2023, 00:35:04] Alex Regueiro: DIdn't know you knitted. Done anything nice recently?
[18/01/2023, 00:35:07] Alice Lafferty: So is Feynman!
[18/01/2023, 00:35:57] Alice Lafferty: It was interesting how many times he protested that he 'didn't understand X himself'. Probably just being modest and personable?
[18/01/2023, 00:36:26] Alex Regueiro: That's the thing, we're very pragmatic about the stability of the solar system... we don't actually know whether it's chaotic or not. We literally have no idea whether in a million years the year will have been chucked out of the solar system or into the sun... but at least we can predict it won't happen in the next few thousand hah
[18/01/2023, 00:36:56] Alice Lafferty: I started around Christmas. I am SO bad at it .
‚Äé[18/01/2023, 00:37:24] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[18/01/2023, 00:37:29] Alice Lafferty: It is not wearable
[18/01/2023, 00:37:35] Alex Regueiro: He is. I really admire that side of his character, and the rarity of that talent along with just being a genius physicist.
[18/01/2023, 00:37:40] Alex Regueiro: His total disdain for philosophy less so. (Mainly because he didn't realise that he himself verged on the philosophical on many occasions!)
[18/01/2023, 00:37:47] Alex Regueiro: And his personal level even less than that haha
[18/01/2023, 00:38:16] Alex Regueiro: Aww. That's cool though. Better first effort that I'd make, I'm sure.
[18/01/2023, 00:38:36] Alice Lafferty: I only have a GCSE understanding of the solar system so I apologise. Gravitation was presented to us in a fairly simple equation, as if that was all there was to it.
[18/01/2023, 00:39:08] Alice Lafferty: He actually told quite a funny joke about philosophers during the Q&A at the end.
[18/01/2023, 00:39:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's what I was saying earlier... I mean, the law of universal gravitation is still the same, but GCSE physics doesn't give you any appreciation for the complex dynamics that can arise from it!
[18/01/2023, 00:39:24] Alex Regueiro: Tell me
[18/01/2023, 00:39:45] Alex Regueiro: And yes, he can be fairly amusing... I love watching snippets of him on Youtube
[18/01/2023, 00:40:27] Alex Regueiro: Are you going to knit something for Otis and force him to wear it?
[18/01/2023, 00:40:30] Alice Lafferty: It was something like: 'the philosopher at dinner must question whether his steak is "really there". That is why there are no philosophers present today, they are all dangerously weakened from hunger.'
[18/01/2023, 00:40:50] Alex Regueiro: haha
[18/01/2023, 00:41:36] Alex Regueiro: I do have some sympathy for his lack of patience for philosophy. Well, a certain sort of philosophy. I just think he paints all philosophy with too broad a brush stroke.
[18/01/2023, 00:41:53] Alice Lafferty: I know that, engineers for example, calculate to a margin of acceptable error... just how big is that when it comes to eg the Earth's orbit?
[18/01/2023, 00:42:34] Alex Regueiro: Sure. We're all limited by error/precision at some point. You can't be infinitely precise except in the wonderful platonic fairyland of mathematics.
[18/01/2023, 00:42:51] Alice Lafferty: Maybe he was particularly going after 'philosophy of science'.
[18/01/2023, 00:42:56] Alex Regueiro: The margin of acceptable error depends how far into the future you want to predict the state of the system.
[18/01/2023, 00:43:17] Alex Regueiro: As time tends towards infinity, the acceptable margin tends towards zero.
[18/01/2023, 00:43:36] Alice Lafferty: I see the appeal then I suppose. 'Real world too messy'.
[18/01/2023, 00:43:51] Alex Regueiro: Presumably. But even then, not all is the same... he ended up actually doing what some would describe as philosophy of science when grappling with quantum field theory!
[18/01/2023, 00:44:08] Alice Lafferty: Oh I'd have thought it'd be the other way round
[18/01/2023, 00:45:43] Alex Regueiro: Yep. It's a horrible sinful over-complicated place. üòâ I've definitely always felt the attraction of the purity and 'simplicity' of things like mathematics and theoretical physics, at some level. I've actually become more of a pragmatist and empiricist over time.
[18/01/2023, 00:46:12] Alex Regueiro: I can tell you a story or two about my lab classes in my undergraduate at some point... but suffice for now to say I was NOT fond of experimental physics despite recognising its fundamental importance even then1
[18/01/2023, 00:46:24] Alex Regueiro: Nope üòÄ
[18/01/2023, 00:46:38] Alice Lafferty: It sucks so much that that we actually seem to be cracking the code on quantum physics (replicating cognition and perhaps consciousness too) yet I will never get to understand it.
[18/01/2023, 00:46:45] Alex Regueiro: You need to have infinitely precise measuring instruments and observations if you want to predict infinitely far into the future.
[18/01/2023, 00:47:09] Alice Lafferty: Your predictions get more accurate the more distant they are in the future?
[18/01/2023, 00:47:33] Alice Lafferty: The answers to the most interesting mysteries are basically raw intelligence gated.
[18/01/2023, 00:47:43] Alice Lafferty: I guess it would be weird if it were otherwise though.
[18/01/2023, 00:47:45] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, I'm not sure we're as close as the media likes to portray on either subject, but we're making progress, there's no doubt... Anyway, if it motivates you to study this, then why not embrace it as a challenge? üôÇ
[18/01/2023, 00:47:51] Alex Regueiro: No no, the opposite
[18/01/2023, 00:48:02] Alex Regueiro: Maybe there was a miscommunication somewhere hmm
[18/01/2023, 00:48:43] Alex Regueiro: To a large extent yes. But I also think it's single-minded focus (obsession even) plays an enormous role too.
[18/01/2023, 00:48:59] Alice Lafferty: That was my (limited) experience with physics too. I really enjoy the theoretical side but I found esp hardware stuff quite boring.
[18/01/2023, 00:49:10] Alice Lafferty: ?
[18/01/2023, 00:49:34] Alex Regueiro: acceptable margin of error for measurements of *initial* conditions (that is, right now)
[18/01/2023, 00:49:46] Alex Regueiro: Should have spelt that out probably...
[18/01/2023, 00:49:53] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see, sorry
[18/01/2023, 00:50:25] Alex Regueiro: Can't blame you. That's perhaps why some of the greatest theoretical physicists were actually mathematicians who gravitated (pun intended) towards science as their education progressed.
[18/01/2023, 00:50:35] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I don't have that either haha!
[18/01/2023, 00:50:53] Alice Lafferty: I don't mind, it's interesting to learn about in an amateur way anyway.
[18/01/2023, 00:51:13] Alex Regueiro: Dirac is an odd exception, though he still sort of oscillated, arriving at an equilibrium of straight theoretical physics as time progressed.
[18/01/2023, 00:52:19] Alice Lafferty: And to be fair theoretical physics is just fantasy without the experimental component.
[18/01/2023, 00:52:39] Alice Lafferty: Oh, interesting, how did he start out?
[18/01/2023, 00:52:40] Alex Regueiro: You definitely have raw intelligence. How much and what sort are the better questions. But possibly those are unanswered too. I should also add, unshakeable self-confidence is an important quality for any genius too, no matter how much natural gift they have!
[18/01/2023, 00:53:13] Alex Regueiro: Engineer (undergrad), then a master's in mathematics, then settled on theoretical physics by his PhD I think.
[18/01/2023, 00:53:57] Alex Regueiro: It is. It degenerates into pure maths. That's why string theory is the butt of so many jokes, and rightly so in most cases. Even Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicists have lambasted it.
[18/01/2023, 00:54:19] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes good point. You have to believe on some level that your goals are achievable or your body literally won't supply serotonin-mediated motivation.
[18/01/2023, 00:54:23] Alex Regueiro: The Hilbertian vision of mathematics has infected so many of us though. üôÅ
[18/01/2023, 00:55:08] Alice Lafferty: I keep coming across this but have put off learning more because I need some solid foundational knowledge first.
[18/01/2023, 00:55:19] Alex Regueiro: Right hah. All these great minds of the past that went for the 'moonshot'... the rational and practical thing to do would always have been to give up on that and work towards some more modest goal. But that's not human nature eh? At least for some of us.
[18/01/2023, 00:55:56] Alice Lafferty: Yes I remember you're not his biggest fan
[18/01/2023, 00:56:30] Alice Lafferty: To be honest what I understood of string theory seems compatible with your structuralism (?)
[18/01/2023, 00:56:31] Alex Regueiro: Went for the moonshot and succeeded, I should say! Most of them failed. And even the ones who succeeded failed at to achieve all their grand aims.
[18/01/2023, 00:56:46] Alex Regueiro: Huge respect for him as a mathematician, but yeah, philosophically very naive I reckon.
[18/01/2023, 00:57:27] Alex Regueiro: It's been so long since I read about it... but yes, possibly. The real issue is the near-total lack of experimentally testable predictions. I get why people work on it though.
[18/01/2023, 00:57:40] Alice Lafferty: Yes, that kind of single-mindedness is technically maladaptive to the organism. Yet obviously highly productive in some cases.
[18/01/2023, 00:58:47] Alice Lafferty: I guess insofar as it makes a step away from a model of discrete particles into something more homogenous and 'fabric'-like.
[18/01/2023, 00:59:02] Alice Lafferty: Why isn't it experimentally testable?
[18/01/2023, 00:59:33] Alex Regueiro: But serious question: would you actually to study it like a physics student, or just an educated layman? Both are valid answers, but... need to be very honest with yourself to avoid frustration and disappointment at feeling these things are beyond your grasp. Hey, most modern physics is beyond my grasp in the details too!
[18/01/2023, 00:59:37] Alex Regueiro: Also, I'm just curious üôÇ
[18/01/2023, 01:00:10] Alex Regueiro: For several reasons... it's actually not always straightforward to derive predictions from the theory, because it's so computationally involved.
[18/01/2023, 01:00:20] Alex Regueiro: Also, we just don't have the engineering capabilities yet, perhaps
[18/01/2023, 01:00:48] Alice Lafferty: Yes good point. I don't really have any intention to take a degree in physics at the moment, no.
[18/01/2023, 01:01:09] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, indeed... you have no idea how many times I've lamented my lack of such immense single-mindedness (but always been grateful for its absence on other occasions).
[18/01/2023, 01:01:36] Alice Lafferty: I mean there are definitely explanations given at levels of complexity, from layman-degree level-phd etc.
[18/01/2023, 01:01:50] Alex Regueiro: Sure, though I was also including the possiblity of studying it "properly but outside of formal education". Like a serious pastime. üôÇ
[18/01/2023, 01:02:30] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, you've probably seen things about this shared at the Internet. Like gravity is one. Everything from child level to PhD levle!
[18/01/2023, 01:03:01] Alice Lafferty: Hmm so it's just tech problem more than anything? It's not theoretically impossible to devise an experiment?
[18/01/2023, 01:03:13] Alex Regueiro: Actually it's quite enlightening to stop and think about this hierarchy of understanding, sometimes.
[18/01/2023, 01:03:25] Alex Regueiro: It's both, I'd say
[18/01/2023, 01:03:48] Alice Lafferty: Maybe, especially because I have so much free time. I've spent the last two weeks just moping basically though.
[18/01/2023, 01:03:49] Alex Regueiro: Though don't press me for details üò¨
[18/01/2023, 01:04:33] Alice Lafferty: I don't see a lot of potential for disappointment re physics because I do not particularly expect to understand it/ I do not have a career resting on my understanding etc.
[18/01/2023, 01:04:46] Alice Lafferty: Oh that's a shame
[18/01/2023, 01:04:46] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I won't press you for details on that either. Especially because I have a lot of sympathy... equally, giving yourself a real challenge and goal medium-term could be really helpful to you, whatever it is.
[18/01/2023, 01:05:18] Alex Regueiro: I mean, you may fail horribly at it, but it will be a fun/interesting failure, and you'll grow!
[18/01/2023, 01:05:35] Alex Regueiro: God knows that's happened to me several times...
[18/01/2023, 01:05:48] Alice Lafferty: I completely agree, that's why I took up knitting haha. Lots of repetitive motion and good tangible sense of your progress.
[18/01/2023, 01:06:07] Alex Regueiro: Right. In some ways that might be liberating though. You can still study it "properly", without the pressure of having to succeed in some practical and worldly sense. üôÇ
[18/01/2023, 01:06:27] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I don't really have anything to lose either.
[18/01/2023, 01:06:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, though at least there are open-ended questions on both counts, so not all hope is lost.
[18/01/2023, 01:06:41] Alice Lafferty: Haha, can't have gone too badly!
[18/01/2023, 01:06:53] Alex Regueiro: Well, I'm just thinking of playing the piano or something...
[18/01/2023, 01:06:54] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[18/01/2023, 01:07:04] Alex Regueiro: I'm frankly pretty bad, but still got some enjoyment and growth out of it.
[18/01/2023, 01:07:23] Alice Lafferty: Ah I'm pretty jealous of that ability!
[18/01/2023, 01:07:23] Alex Regueiro: Started way too late too (if you discount the one or two years I learnt as a young kid)
[18/01/2023, 01:07:38] Alice Lafferty: Really? Haven't you been playing since a child?
[18/01/2023, 01:07:50] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I think it's a great idea.
[18/01/2023, 01:08:07] Alice Lafferty: Do you know much about M-theory?
[18/01/2023, 01:08:12] Alex Regueiro: Plus you can foist gifts on friends and family that they don't really want, and they'll feel they have to use them üòÄ
[18/01/2023, 01:08:15] Alex Regueiro: Or Otis at least
[18/01/2023, 01:08:36] Alice Lafferty: Oh definitely. My family is getting socks for Christmas for the rest of their lives :)
[18/01/2023, 01:08:39] Alex Regueiro: Almost nothing. I read about all that as a teenager in pop science books, and was interested, but forgotten almost all
[18/01/2023, 01:09:08] Alice Lafferty: It's a bit late in the season now, could have made him a little winter jacket or something...
[18/01/2023, 01:09:29] Alex Regueiro: Me too. But I also accept at some level that I just don't have the right sort of mind to it, and if I wanted to be very good anyway, I should have stuck at it when I was young... but then, I gave up for a reason back then, so I'm not kicking myself too much.
[18/01/2023, 01:09:42] Alice Lafferty: Haha that's exactly what I did.
[18/01/2023, 01:09:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah but you'll be a much better knitter as next Christmas approaches right?
[18/01/2023, 01:10:26] Alice Lafferty: Don't want to overestimate heritability of these traits but...
[18/01/2023, 01:10:36] Alice Lafferty: What makes you say you 'don't have the right mind' ?
[18/01/2023, 01:10:36] Alex Regueiro: I have so many on my bookshelf still, some unread. My granddad was a bit of a book-hoarder. But he actually read a lot too in his retirement. As he reminisced on what his life would have been like as a physicist...
[18/01/2023, 01:11:59] Alice Lafferty: *This is really a good analogy for my ""scientifc career"". I'm not going to become a concert pianist, I just want to be able to tap out a little tune to entertain myself.
[18/01/2023, 01:12:26] Alex Regueiro: Eh, it's too involved to explain right now, I think, but my thinking is more the slow-and-methodical type, and my hand-eye coordination just average. I was always really slow at reading sheet music, for a start.
[18/01/2023, 01:13:01] Alex Regueiro: That's an honourable but realistic goal, yep
[18/01/2023, 01:13:14] Alice Lafferty: I think so long as you have good fine motor control (which will be for a long time yet) - you have every opportunity to improve?
[18/01/2023, 01:13:22] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[18/01/2023, 01:13:39] Alex Regueiro: I accepted that with the piano to be honest, though I haven't played for a few months just being preoccupied with other things and a bit disheartened at my lack of ability too...
[18/01/2023, 01:14:27] Alice Lafferty: Oh look: https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/features/the-enduring-myth-of-music-and-maths-2307387.html?amp
[18/01/2023, 01:14:36] Alice Lafferty: So I was wrong about this
[18/01/2023, 01:14:37] Alex Regueiro: True to some extent. Though I also lament not having the plastic mind of a child any more. Even you're too old to become a top-level pianist now, I dare say! (Sorry)
[18/01/2023, 01:14:57] Alice Lafferty: Yes I understand that feeling.
[18/01/2023, 01:15:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I never really got that myth. Music theory certainly appeals to the mathematical mind, but music performance... eh, not so much.
[18/01/2023, 01:15:46] Alice Lafferty: You have lots of other things going for you though, & being  a competent piano, at all, is a nice string to your bow.
[18/01/2023, 01:16:04] Alice Lafferty: I know! Why didn't my parents raise my bilingual!!
[18/01/2023, 01:16:11] Alice Lafferty: *me
[18/01/2023, 01:16:16] Alex Regueiro: I have a couple of nice old books on music theory sitting around actually. Will get to them at some point! Picked them up years ago at some charming boutique bookshop in Hampstead as I recall.
[18/01/2023, 01:16:32] Alice Lafferty: My mum is a fluent French speaker (lived there for a bit)! Total waste
[18/01/2023, 01:16:33] Alex Regueiro: I see what you did there, hah!
[18/01/2023, 01:16:39] Alex Regueiro: But thank you, that's kind of you to say.
[18/01/2023, 01:16:52] Alex Regueiro: I hope the same... I hope, even if I don't always feel that way
[18/01/2023, 01:17:10] Alice Lafferty: Literally just another casualty of the replication crisis probably
[18/01/2023, 01:17:21] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, same! I don't really have a knack for languages either, even though I was good at them in school.
[18/01/2023, 01:17:52] Alex Regueiro: And it's not like I was realistically ever going to be raised bilingual, with English-speaking parents
[18/01/2023, 01:18:09] Alex Regueiro: Unless you count American English as a separate language, which I sometimes think is fair!
[18/01/2023, 01:18:10] Alice Lafferty: I've probably been there.. spent a lot of time in a particular shop in Hampstead in my teens - was it Keith Fawkes?
[18/01/2023, 01:18:20] Alex Regueiro: Probably yep
[18/01/2023, 01:18:36] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's it! üôÇ
[18/01/2023, 01:18:45] Alice Lafferty: Same, I don't know if that was because I was just good at memorising the vocabulary.
[18/01/2023, 01:18:56] Alice Lafferty: Immersion is probably the only way to learn properly anyway.
[18/01/2023, 01:19:27] Alex Regueiro: Probably. But you need immense drive for that. A fire in your belly. Or perhaps just poverty!
[18/01/2023, 01:19:51] Alice Lafferty: There are quite a few French speaking secondary schools in London, I knew people who  attended them...
[18/01/2023, 01:20:12] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, for me it was a combo of that and just a decent analytic mind. But speaking/listening was always my worst part. So I was golden with Latin, but French and Spanish were marginally trickier...
[18/01/2023, 01:20:16] Alice Lafferty: Lycee francais charles de gaulle?
[18/01/2023, 01:20:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I've vaguely heard of that one?
[18/01/2023, 01:20:41] Alex Regueiro: Where did your mum live in France by the way?
[18/01/2023, 01:20:48] Alice Lafferty: It's great there! The owner's a real snob though! Still I am a loyal customer.
[18/01/2023, 01:20:59] Alex Regueiro: My dad used to speak fluent French from his time living in Paris, but is pretty rusty these days...
[18/01/2023, 01:21:13] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I don't care enough probably.
[18/01/2023, 01:21:36] Alex Regueiro: Haha. I kind of think that adds to the charm of an old-fashioned bookshop though. Only fitting, isn't it?
[18/01/2023, 01:21:50] Alice Lafferty: Haha right. I know you have an interest in linguistics but again that seems to be the theoretical side rather than practical (I might be wrong?)
[18/01/2023, 01:22:07] Alex Regueiro: Exactly. It's much more theoretical/analytical than speaking a language
[18/01/2023, 01:22:17] Alex Regueiro: the scientific side of language
[18/01/2023, 01:22:34] Alice Lafferty: * Chamonix in the Alps, near Swiss border.
[18/01/2023, 01:22:43] Alice Lafferty: Where we go skiing
[18/01/2023, 01:23:35] Alice Lafferty: Yes for sure. It's kind of difficult to get to on the northern line now, but it was ok when I was at school in Edgware.
[18/01/2023, 01:24:13] Alice Lafferty: Oh haha, did I show you this?
[18/01/2023, 01:24:43] Alice Lafferty: https://amp.theguardian.com/education/2022/dec/24/north-london-collegiate-school-investigated-a-level-grades-2021-malpractice-allegations
[18/01/2023, 01:24:46] Alex Regueiro: Just like music theory is the "scientific" side of music. The irony is that my father did his master's in music theory, when he had more talent by far for playing instruments! He was still good at music theory, it just wasn't the most natural thing. Me on the other hand... it would be the opposite. I'm convinced that natural ability is skipping a generation in my family. Intellectually I have a great deal in common with my father's father, and mother's father to a lesser extent... and maybe if I have a child, he/she will be a piano prodigy but so-so at maths and physics! üòâ
[18/01/2023, 01:25:01] Alex Regueiro: Ah cool. Was she a ski instructor or something?
[18/01/2023, 01:25:52] Alice Lafferty: Hm that's interesting
[18/01/2023, 01:26:10] Alice Lafferty: Yeah if I had a child I'm afraid I would be one of those parents who pushed them to play a musical instrument
[18/01/2023, 01:26:22] Alice Lafferty: She taught English
[18/01/2023, 01:26:35] Alex Regueiro: Haha you didn't. Your school right? You're going to need to put a disclaimer on your CV: "No, I graduated the year BEFORE the scandal!"
[18/01/2023, 01:26:43] Alex Regueiro: That was my other guess heh
[18/01/2023, 01:26:47] Alex Regueiro: Anyway sounds fun
[18/01/2023, 01:27:08] Alex Regueiro: In the late 80s or early 90s I take it
[18/01/2023, 01:27:15] Alice Lafferty: Is this perhaps like how some composers are not the best performers of their own work?
[18/01/2023, 01:27:32] Alice Lafferty: Yes! It didn't surprise me to be honest
[18/01/2023, 01:28:07] Alex Regueiro: Hah same. Even though my dad sort of did it with me and my sister and it backfired. Possibly because we didn't have the aptitude for it, possibly because a parent teaching their child is always fraught with difficulties, possibly he was just a crappy teacher. Possibly all three!
[18/01/2023, 01:28:11] Alice Lafferty: Late 90s I think, just before she met my dad.
[18/01/2023, 01:28:23] Alice Lafferty: Did I tell you they met at Heathrow airport
[18/01/2023, 01:28:37] Alice Lafferty: Oh he taught you personally?
[18/01/2023, 01:28:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh, fair enough. It wasn't just having children late, they married quite late too eh?
[18/01/2023, 01:28:42] Alex Regueiro: Yeah he did
[18/01/2023, 01:28:55] Alice Lafferty: That's quite different I imagine!
[18/01/2023, 01:28:59] Alex Regueiro: Just for 18 or 24 months before we both gave it up I think.
[18/01/2023, 01:29:05] Alex Regueiro: absolutely
[18/01/2023, 01:29:22] Alex Regueiro: Not the best idea in hindsight perhaps. I don't blame my dad for it though... even though my mum warned him it might not be wise hah.
[18/01/2023, 01:29:28] Alice Lafferty: Just like it's difficult to be totally objective with your own children/father.
[18/01/2023, 01:29:34] Alex Regueiro: Haha no, tell me more!
[18/01/2023, 01:30:08] Alice Lafferty: Yes I suppose so.. my mum was also 6 months pregnant with me at her wedding though!
[18/01/2023, 01:30:27] Alice Lafferty: How long before your birth did your parents get married?
[18/01/2023, 01:31:10] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I can completely understand why he took it upon himself to teach you.
[18/01/2023, 01:31:24] Alex Regueiro: Shotgun wedding? üòâ
[18/01/2023, 01:31:45] Alex Regueiro: I'd do the same if I had the ability and love for it... even if objectively it wasn't the best idea.
[18/01/2023, 01:32:08] Alex Regueiro: Was born just under three years after they married.
[18/01/2023, 01:32:23] Alex Regueiro: They married August 87
[18/01/2023, 01:32:39] Alice Lafferty: They claim otherwise... to be fair they were engaged for a year before.
[18/01/2023, 01:32:50] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair. Was just kidding anyway.
[18/01/2023, 01:33:10] Alex Regueiro: Your mum's parents wouldn't have cared anyway right?
[18/01/2023, 01:33:24] Alice Lafferty: My parents have refused to teach me how to drive for what I thought were trumped up reasons. But maybe they have a point.
[18/01/2023, 01:34:06] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. My parents taught me a little in the US when I was 16, but over here I had lessons. Did you?
[18/01/2023, 01:34:16] Alice Lafferty: Ah you're turning 33 this year‚úùÔ∏è
[18/01/2023, 01:34:24] Alice Lafferty: No!
[18/01/2023, 01:34:41] Alex Regueiro: And I'm grateful for that. Dad's a terrible driver, mum's a good one, but even with her I can envisage it not being ideal.
[18/01/2023, 01:34:49] Alex Regueiro: Yep, don't remind me
[18/01/2023, 01:34:56] Alex Regueiro: Oh, cross because Jesus died at that age?
[18/01/2023, 01:35:07] Alice Lafferty: I haven't had any yet, although my parents have offered to buy me some.
[18/01/2023, 01:35:27] Alex Regueiro: Hey, at least I made it past 27... I remember being conscious of it at that age, despite hardly living a sex, drugs, and rock & roll lifestyle.
[18/01/2023, 01:35:51] Alice Lafferty: My mum would be so reluctant to criticise me that we would end up both dyeing in a fiery car crash. There's a metaphor in there somewhere...
[18/01/2023, 01:36:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[18/01/2023, 01:37:25] Alice Lafferty: Haha yeah. I always worry about accidentally overdosing when taking literally any medication. Even though I'm the most cautious person ever.
[18/01/2023, 01:38:14] Alice Lafferty: Are you going to do anything to celebratev
[18/01/2023, 01:38:17] Alice Lafferty: *?
[18/01/2023, 01:38:32] Alex Regueiro: Which year of his death do you accept incidentally? I think I was convinced by the 30 AD one. I find it almost haunting that we can know (with a good deal of confidence at least) the very day, location, and the approximate hour at which he died!
[18/01/2023, 01:38:44] Alex Regueiro: Thanks in large part to the lunar eclipse.
[18/01/2023, 01:38:51] Alex Regueiro: Which Newton used, of course.
[18/01/2023, 01:38:51] Alice Lafferty: Is this because of the eclipse?
[18/01/2023, 01:38:57] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah
[18/01/2023, 01:39:19] Alex Regueiro: Yes, and fancy calculations about the date of Passover according to rabbinical law back then
[18/01/2023, 01:39:34] Alice Lafferty: There have been attempts to locate the date of birth using the 'star'.
[18/01/2023, 01:40:26] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes... I'm happy you evidently have such a kind loving mother though. üòä
[18/01/2023, 01:40:35] Alex Regueiro: And I've already been in one semi-bad crash though, with no help from my parents, so...
[18/01/2023, 01:40:47] Alex Regueiro: Oh interesting. I don't think I read about that one.
[18/01/2023, 01:41:17] Alex Regueiro: Same! Well less so nowadays, but I was for years
[18/01/2023, 01:41:27] Alex Regueiro: Probably not. I rarely do. How about you?
[18/01/2023, 01:41:48] Alice Lafferty: Yeah because the star of bethlehem in ~3BC is not identifiable with any actual phenomenonüò¨
[18/01/2023, 01:42:18] Alice Lafferty: Obviously possible it was some very minor meteor shower or whatever?
[18/01/2023, 01:42:31] Alice Lafferty: ? When was this?
[18/01/2023, 01:42:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah hah. The star story sounds likelier to have been pulled out of thin air anyway... just to make a good story.
[18/01/2023, 01:42:46] Alex Regueiro: Early 20s?
[18/01/2023, 01:43:01] Alice Lafferty: It is my 21st. Sort of the last 'big' one. So I feel I ought to.
[18/01/2023, 01:43:14] Alice Lafferty: I agree
[18/01/2023, 01:43:15] Alex Regueiro: Haven't had a car for years though
[18/01/2023, 01:43:20] Alice Lafferty: How serious?
[18/01/2023, 01:43:41] Alex Regueiro: You should. üôÇ I feel I should do one to make up for my 30th being over total lockdown too...
[18/01/2023, 01:44:06] Alex Regueiro: I did one for my 18th I think, but very few in general. I'm a small-event sort of person as you know (if any event)
[18/01/2023, 01:44:32] Alice Lafferty: Yeah same really.
[18/01/2023, 01:44:45] Alex Regueiro: Car was totalled, but I didn't have more than a light scrap. The guy in the other car similar, though his claim would have made you think otherwise!
[18/01/2023, 01:45:29] Alice Lafferty: Oh damn. Which part of the car was hit? Do you consider it a lucky escape?
[18/01/2023, 01:45:46] Alice Lafferty: I know that passenger side is most dangerous
[18/01/2023, 01:45:51] Alex Regueiro: I was coming back from the tennis club, had a cold still, and was knackered. Narrow windy road, and I overcompensated for starting to veer off slightly... went into the side of the car coming the other way and spun around a few times. üò¨
[18/01/2023, 01:46:16] Alice Lafferty: Wait have you told me about this before?
[18/01/2023, 01:46:19] Alice Lafferty: Maybe not in detail?
[18/01/2023, 01:46:44] Alex Regueiro: Could have been much worse too be fair. I didn't feel too guilty since the other guy was basically fine (his car less so), and when the police came (as they always do), they didn't give me even a careless driving warning, let alone reckless. They were very human about it all.
[18/01/2023, 01:46:49] Alex Regueiro: I don't think I did to be fair
[18/01/2023, 01:46:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[18/01/2023, 01:47:23] Alice Lafferty: TIREDNESS CAN KILL
[18/01/2023, 01:47:36] Alice Lafferty: But not in your case luckily
[18/01/2023, 01:47:39] Alex Regueiro: And no, I don't think my life was in danger at all. Could have gotten a moderate injury at worst. I wasn't speeding thankfully (on a 30mph road)
[18/01/2023, 01:47:58] Alice Lafferty: Oh that's not too bad then.
[18/01/2023, 01:48:27] Alex Regueiro: Heh yes. And nasty colds that cloud up your head! I probably shouldn't have been playing tennis even, but I was kind of fed up of the cold dragging on by that point...
[18/01/2023, 01:48:52] Alex Regueiro: Yeah nothing drastic. It didn't work me up too much. Worked up my insurance premium alright though!
[18/01/2023, 01:49:12] Alice Lafferty: I noticed some people playing tennis locally last night, it was -2 degrees :S
[18/01/2023, 01:49:20] Alice Lafferty: Have you been playing indoors?
[18/01/2023, 01:49:23] Alex Regueiro: Lunatics
[18/01/2023, 01:49:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah indoors
[18/01/2023, 01:49:44] Alex Regueiro: I've played football in 2 degrees in shorts in my reckless youth... but even that's different!
[18/01/2023, 01:50:09] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah of course. I don't know how this works, your insurance company has to pay the other party?
[18/01/2023, 01:50:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Minus a fixed (fairly low) amount you have to pay... I forget the name for it.
[18/01/2023, 01:51:25] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, I'm glad not to have driven in recent years. Only a handful of occasions I desperately wanted to go someone in a car by myself.
[18/01/2023, 01:51:47] Alice Lafferty: Do you exert yourself more during football than tennis?
[18/01/2023, 01:51:53] Alex Regueiro: So what's going to be the plan for Alice's 21st birthday bash?!
[18/01/2023, 01:52:10] Alex Regueiro: Yeah you stay a bit warmer through the constant running around I'd say
[18/01/2023, 01:52:20] Alice Lafferty: Yeah there's no need really.
[18/01/2023, 01:52:48] Alice Lafferty: There's no plan at all at the moment!
[18/01/2023, 01:53:18] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I'd have enough people to invite to constitute a 'bash'.
[18/01/2023, 01:54:06] Alex Regueiro: I was being facetious... But yeah, even if you did have dozens and dozens of friend I imagine you'd want to keep it fairly small!
[18/01/2023, 01:54:16] Alice Lafferty: I probably won't make a big deal out of it.
[18/01/2023, 01:54:23] Alice Lafferty: Yeah
[18/01/2023, 01:54:29] Alex Regueiro: It's funny you mentioned it because this year is perhaps the first time I've even considered doing one in a looong time
[18/01/2023, 01:54:49] Alice Lafferty: Maybe a bit of rebound from cabin fever
[18/01/2023, 01:54:53] Alice Lafferty: You should!
[18/01/2023, 01:54:53] Alex Regueiro: Not that I've given it more than passing consideration either
[18/01/2023, 01:54:59] Alex Regueiro: yeah quite possibly!
[18/01/2023, 01:55:28] Alex Regueiro: I think maybe organising the salon's Christmas dinner inspired me slightly... still not sure how/why I ended up taking that on, but hey.
[18/01/2023, 01:55:33] Alice Lafferty: It could be fun. Arrange things so that you have somewhere to retire to if you feel like it..
[18/01/2023, 01:55:52] Alice Lafferty: You will receive so much alcohol in the way of gifts
[18/01/2023, 01:55:59] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes.
[18/01/2023, 01:56:11] Alex Regueiro: That's definitely the way to plan it
[18/01/2023, 01:56:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see. The planning wasn't too tortuous and it came off quite well right?
[18/01/2023, 01:56:44] Alice Lafferty: Even though it was in the midst of a train strike (beyond your control obviously).
[18/01/2023, 01:57:49] Alice Lafferty: Speaking of which, when is the next salon?
[18/01/2023, 01:59:03] Alex Regueiro: Neither tortuous nor torturous. Yeah, it all turned out nicely considering the commie unionist bastards decided to strike then. Only two people cancelled and they still paid for things, kindly. (The management sort of stitched me up there, but not worth going into.)
[18/01/2023, 01:59:33] Alex Regueiro: One of the guys who couldn't make it was ridiculously generous and bought us all a ¬£120 magnum of champagne. (I found out the price later.0
[18/01/2023, 02:00:14] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, I was going to mention. Unfortunately it's been slow getting going this year, so the plan is now the 1st Feb, probably when you're away, sorry. üôÅ
[18/01/2023, 02:00:30] Alex Regueiro: Next one I hope? Probably three weeks later.
[18/01/2023, 02:01:20] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah I remember you had to pay a deposit?
[18/01/2023, 02:01:32] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Worse than that in the end, but long story...
[18/01/2023, 02:01:34] Alice Lafferty: Wow nice!
[18/01/2023, 02:01:50] Alex Regueiro: Was a lovely evening in spite of all the obstacles!
[18/01/2023, 02:02:05] Alice Lafferty: No offence but I did supsect you would lose out in some way by paying the deposit yourself!
[18/01/2023, 02:02:21] Alice Lafferty: Yes it looked like it!
[18/01/2023, 02:02:27] Alex Regueiro: I don't know why I did. I'm not usually a generous person, I swear!
[18/01/2023, 02:02:49] Alex Regueiro: But I didn't actually lose out in the end because the three who had to pull out last minute were all very honourable about it.
[18/01/2023, 02:02:51] Alice Lafferty: Oh that's a shame. I will check again when we're goingüôÑ
[18/01/2023, 02:02:54] Alex Regueiro: (And I did warn them)
[18/01/2023, 02:03:14] Alice Lafferty: Yes so you made the right judgement based on the members of the group
[18/01/2023, 02:03:45] Alex Regueiro: I used to be like that with family hols too... happily leaving it to others, even as an adult!
[18/01/2023, 02:03:55] Alice Lafferty: If the management were not very obliging, maybe it was lucky you didn't have to call them at the last minute and ask for an extra place for me!
[18/01/2023, 02:04:07] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, I still need to take a shower (grr why do I always put it off after coming back from tennis?)
[18/01/2023, 02:04:10] Alex Regueiro: So I bid you good night
[18/01/2023, 02:04:19] Alice Lafferty: Haha ok
[18/01/2023, 02:04:27] Alex Regueiro: But lovely chatting again, really. Glad to have you 'back' haha.
[18/01/2023, 02:04:29] Alice Lafferty: Ok good night!
[18/01/2023, 02:04:54] Alice Lafferty: Thank you for being so understanding.
[18/01/2023, 02:05:14] Alex Regueiro: Let me know tomorrow about the Kurosawa too, of course. I'll leave my evening free until you tell me, but equally happy to go to the showing tomorrow or this weekend or next week. üôÇ
[18/01/2023, 02:05:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes I promise I won't leave it to the last minute/flake this time.
[18/01/2023, 02:06:29] Alex Regueiro: Not at all! I totally get you, at least I think. We're all entitled to just escape from the outside world for a while, every now and then...
[18/01/2023, 02:07:01] Alice Lafferty: Right, some (me) take more liabilities than others though
[18/01/2023, 02:07:09] Alex Regueiro: Hah they were in a way, just... well, never mind!
[18/01/2023, 02:07:25] Alex Regueiro: Liberties you mean?
[18/01/2023, 02:07:30] Alice Lafferty: You can tell me another time if you feel like it
[18/01/2023, 02:07:38] Alice Lafferty: üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
[18/01/2023, 02:07:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[18/01/2023, 02:07:47] Alex Regueiro: Sure. We always have much more interesting things to talk about though. üòâ
[18/01/2023, 02:07:55] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I am not functioning at 100%...
[18/01/2023, 02:08:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I can't blame you, it IS late, even for two vampires like us.
[18/01/2023, 02:08:21] Alex Regueiro: Va bene, buona notte! A domani.
[18/01/2023, 02:08:41] Alice Lafferty: Night!
[19/01/2023, 00:44:51] Alex Regueiro: üëÄ
[19/01/2023, 03:40:40] Alice Lafferty: Hi sorry, let's do Sanjuro on the 26th.
[19/01/2023, 03:42:35] Alice Lafferty: By the way something else coming up re CofE which might be interesting: the bishops' collective wisdom on the LLF consultation (gay marriage) will be shared on Friday apparently, same day as recommendations being taken to General Synod are published.
[19/01/2023, 03:43:42] Alice Lafferty: They will probably just shuffle and drag their feet on it like they've been doing for years.
[19/01/2023, 03:43:52] Alice Lafferty: But it might be interesting.
[19/01/2023, 03:44:39] Alice Lafferty: Also I watched the chaos control video you sent (thank you).
[19/01/2023, 03:44:53] Alice Lafferty: Reminded me of Joseph Conway's Game of Life.
[19/01/2023, 03:47:27] Alice Lafferty: Also more than anything reinforced my belief that computer science & AI are the most fertile and exciting fields for the foreseeable future.
[19/01/2023, 17:35:46] Alex Regueiro: Okay cool! You're definitely around then? I'll go ahead and get the tickets.
[19/01/2023, 17:36:18] Alex Regueiro: Interesting
[19/01/2023, 17:37:09] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I think even Welby did a bit of that? Though I know in the past (before he became archbishop of Canterbury) he actually spoke in favour of civil unions that are legally on par with marriage, but not marriage per se. And I think the Archbishop of York said similar things.
[19/01/2023, 17:37:34] Alex Regueiro: Actually that's sort of my view these days, though I'm not overly bothered if they call gay legal unions "marriage".
[19/01/2023, 17:38:01] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's definitely a controlled chaotic system, I'd say!
[19/01/2023, 17:38:11] Alex Regueiro: Well observed
[19/01/2023, 17:38:31] Alex Regueiro: It's good fun just to play around with too... not sure if you have before
[19/01/2023, 17:39:07] Alex Regueiro: Quite possible, though it's all very cross-disciplinary these days, and that's a positive thing especially when it comes to AI. üôÇ
[19/01/2023, 17:39:23] Alex Regueiro: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/17/this-song-sucks-nick-cave-responds-to-chatgpt-song-written-in-style-of-nick-cave
Haha
[20/01/2023, 20:56:15] Alice Lafferty: Ha I saw this as well. Did you actually read the lyrics to the song?
[20/01/2023, 20:56:39] Alice Lafferty: I thought they absolutely passed as something a middling fake-deep songwriter would produce!
[20/01/2023, 20:57:19] Alice Lafferty: Blah blah blah 'authentic artistic struggle'
[20/01/2023, 20:58:08] Alice Lafferty: I'd be really interested in its ability to compose music though...
[20/01/2023, 20:58:31] Alice Lafferty: I know you said you enjoyed the theory side - have you ever composed yourself?
[20/01/2023, 20:59:06] Alice Lafferty: üëç Although I can get my own ticket ofc!
[20/01/2023, 21:00:57] Alice Lafferty: They produce Turing patterns right?
[20/01/2023, 22:10:11] Alex Regueiro: Just the lines mentioned in the article
[20/01/2023, 22:10:24] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah that was sort of my reaction too
[20/01/2023, 22:10:47] Alex Regueiro: Though I do take his point. Good lyrics speak to something intrinsically human.
[20/01/2023, 22:11:03] Alex Regueiro: And ChatGPT is literally an excellent pastiche maker
[20/01/2023, 22:11:08] Alex Regueiro: It can't think any deeper
[20/01/2023, 22:11:32] Alex Regueiro: No... I shudder to think how bad it would be in truth! Takes a lot of training to write something half decent I'd say.
[20/01/2023, 22:11:36] Alex Regueiro: Well, depends on the genre.
[20/01/2023, 22:12:11] Alex Regueiro: Lyrics on the other hand... ChatGPT might as well write them for the next Ed Sheeran / Taylor Swift single, and we wouldn't be any the wiser!
[20/01/2023, 22:13:28] Alex Regueiro: I don't actually know. But they can produce really interesting results, including ones that are dynamic in time. Some people have created incredibly complex 'games'. Like you can simulate a Turing machine on the Game of Life. So it's a Universal Turing Machine. üòÄ
[20/01/2023, 22:14:14] Alex Regueiro: I just thought it would be easier if I did it. It's like ¬£11 or ¬£12 I think. 9:00pm on the 26th. Didn't realise that one was a bit later than the others, but hope it's fine with you still. üôÇ
[21/01/2023, 09:13:18] Alice Lafferty: 'Good artists borrow, great artists steal'
[21/01/2023, 09:16:54] Alice Lafferty: I disagree actually. Most people never develop their own vocabulary to make sense of their own life, they just refer to commonly available cultural tropes. That's exactly what Chat GPT3 is doing.
[21/01/2023, 09:17:32] Alice Lafferty: Can I ask what you mean by this?
[21/01/2023, 09:18:49] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I actually picked that one partly because it was in the evening and that is when I prefer travelling (sorry! - would you have preferred something earlier?)
[21/01/2023, 09:19:49] Alice Lafferty: Yes probably have to dedicate a substantial amount of time to it
[21/01/2023, 09:20:10] Alice Lafferty: It would be really cool though I think, probably the artistic medium I admire most.
[21/01/2023, 09:26:03] Alice Lafferty: I basically agree with this. 1) I think destigmatisation of gay relationships is good but equally 2) I'm sympathetic with their attempt to keep sex tethered to reproduction (rather than recreation)...
[21/01/2023, 09:27:38] Alice Lafferty: * their being the Anglican & Catholic churches (despite Bergoglio's perverted curia...)
[21/01/2023, 09:27:46] Alice Lafferty: It seems like they've tried to adopt this halfway position where they bless gay unions but don't sacralise them...? It doesn't really make sense. This all such a throwback to 2003 anyway.
[21/01/2023, 10:14:02] Alice Lafferty: Apparently Minecraft is also Turing completeüòê
[21/01/2023, 10:15:06] Alice Lafferty: (Roger) Penrose tiles lend themselves quite well to cellular automata. Although I don't know much about them beyond that.

[21/01/2023, 15:50:49] Alex Regueiro: Sure most people don't, but I'm talking about good (even great) lyrics here, which are decidedly difficult to craft!
[21/01/2023, 15:53:04] Alex Regueiro: ChatGPT is just doing a clever (complex) regurgitation of existing lyrics it's been trained on. It doesn't evidence any true understanding of what they are talking about, to me. There's no genuine novelty. Like I think I've said before, it's more a matter of degree when contrasting this with human ingenuity, but the gulf is still a chasm right now.
[21/01/2023, 15:54:33] Alex Regueiro: Creativity is sort of all about the blending of previous experiences and influences, but the question is how good that "blender" is. How much semantic abstraction is it doing? Not very much in ChatGPT's case, from what I can tell.
[21/01/2023, 15:55:11] Alex Regueiro: Nope that's fine and dandy with me. I kind of like it too. Less crazy on the trains. Just checking with you. üôÇ
[21/01/2023, 15:56:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah probably for me too. I know a lot more about music and composers than I do about art and artists, or poetry and poets, for example.
[21/01/2023, 15:57:07] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's an odd compromise... verges on self-contradiction. I can't see it leading to anything other than problems in the long run.
[21/01/2023, 15:57:15] Alex Regueiro: Right
[21/01/2023, 15:57:26] Alex Regueiro: What's this about Bergoglio's curia though? I don't think I've heard.
[21/01/2023, 15:57:50] Alex Regueiro: Never played but I've heard this too haha.
[21/01/2023, 16:03:33] Alex Regueiro: That's cool. By the nature of Penrose tilings (aperiodicity) it must be extremely hard to design anything explicitly for such a grid though! You probably get even more "chaos" though, in the technical sense.
[22/01/2023, 09:07:30] Alice Lafferty: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344431853_Artificial_intelligence_versus_Maya_Angelou_Experimental_evidence_that_people_cannot_differentiate_AI-generated_from_human-written_poetry üò¨
[22/01/2023, 09:07:51] Alice Lafferty: Interesting though: 'Further, people reveal a slight aversion to algorithm-generated poetry, independent on whether participants were informed about the algorithmic origin of the poem (Transparency) or not (Opacity)'
[22/01/2023, 09:10:52] Alice Lafferty: I agree that its still pretty rudimentary. But I also think that the machine and human creative processes are not fundamentally different in kind. Ie a machine very much has the potential to produce literature on par with human 'greats', and will probably do so at some point in the future.
[22/01/2023, 09:12:14] Alice Lafferty: Re novelty - it sounds to me like you're making the 'Lovelace objection'. Do your objections align with any of the original nine Turing responded to, out of interest?
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/#Tur195ResObj
[22/01/2023, 09:14:11] Alice Lafferty: And re chatgpt3 'not evidencing any true understanding'.... Well, I am about to steer this conversation back into philosophy of mind (my favourite topic), so please stop me now if you don't want to proceed any furtherüòÖ
[22/01/2023, 09:15:40] Alice Lafferty: Possibly the whole thing boils down to the question of whether syntax can give rise to semantics. This might be more your field...
[22/01/2023, 09:17:43] Alice Lafferty: Theories that are eliminitavist about consciousness/qualia altogether bridge the machine-mammalian brain gap the best. So I'm attracted to those at the moment.
[22/01/2023, 09:25:10] Alice Lafferty: Oh, he essentially made reforms that allow any Catholic to lead Vatican offices without being ordained. Silly because it just creates a laity of clericalized busy-bodies.
[22/01/2023, 11:12:22] Alice Lafferty: * I've been reading about how GANs and sub-symbolic AI work, obviously the comparisons to the brain are already made. Again, definitely your field.
[23/01/2023, 00:36:16] Alex Regueiro: Hah. It probably speaks more about the typical cultural sophistication of your average 21st C Western person than it does about the AI!
[23/01/2023, 00:36:31] Alex Regueiro: Very interesting.
[23/01/2023, 00:37:15] Alex Regueiro: Like a subconscious knowledge that it is shit poetry, even though the conscious doesn't have the sophistication to properly analyse it...
[23/01/2023, 00:37:45] Alex Regueiro: The id knows but the superego is none the wiser!
[23/01/2023, 00:39:17] Alex Regueiro: I don't dispute this, yeah. In fact, I think this goes back to something we discussed before and I alluded to here again with my "blender" analogy. It just seems the degree of "blending" (or the level of abstraction if you well is still (deceptively) simplistic.
[23/01/2023, 00:41:16] Alex Regueiro: Ah, it's been a long time since I read about the Turing Test... I think that kind of applies here, yes. Though more importantly I'd argue that ChatGPT fails the Turing Test in its general case, and I think that's pretty well established anyway. Maybe in restricted subdomains of conversation it can (sort of) pass, but that's it for me.
[23/01/2023, 00:43:08] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I don't think any computer to date has passed.
[23/01/2023, 00:44:19] Alice Lafferty: Also learning about the hype generated around the ELIZA chatbot in the 60s has put this into perspective a bit for me.
[23/01/2023, 00:44:52] Alex Regueiro: Haha, it's all good. It's a fun topic indeed (even if I think parts of the field are bollocks). As for syntax and semantics, I would say no, and along the lines of a similar response I've given. They're two different categories. Syntax is quite mechanical, even material/physical you could say. Semantics is fundamentally phenomenal in nature. There can't be causation in any meaningful (hah) sense between the two categories.
[23/01/2023, 00:45:14] Alex Regueiro: Yes! I remember reading about that when first getting interest in AI.
[23/01/2023, 00:45:17] Alex Regueiro: Way back when
[23/01/2023, 00:45:37] Alice Lafferty: Maybe syntax is necessary but not sufficient in some sense (for language).
[23/01/2023, 00:45:39] Alex Regueiro: How how naive even the foremost researchers of the field were back then... thinking that logic programming was the way to go!
[23/01/2023, 00:46:18] Alice Lafferty: Maybe it's working at the level of like a particularly under-socialised person.
[23/01/2023, 00:47:44] Alice Lafferty: I do find it interesting that much behaviour is caused by the brain (subconsciously) performing statistical inferences... it's quite problematic for intentionality and moral responsibility and such.
[23/01/2023, 00:48:20] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. What sort of 'eliminativist' are you right now, would you say? I mean, please elaborate. üôÇ
[23/01/2023, 00:48:56] Alex Regueiro: Possibly, though I don't think the "processing power", to put it crudely, is even remotely like that of an uneducated child or undersocialised person.
[23/01/2023, 00:49:09] Alice Lafferty: I'm not fully committed to eliminative materialism (which suggests that mental states 'do not really exist'), but maybe a 'soft' form of that.
[23/01/2023, 00:49:38] Alex Regueiro: That's cool. Any particularly nice insights?
[23/01/2023, 00:49:40] Alice Lafferty: Like, mental states described in folk psychological terms do not refer to real things.
[23/01/2023, 00:49:42] Alex Regueiro: I see
[23/01/2023, 00:50:04] Alex Regueiro: I'm sort of a "weak reductionist", I think you'd say, so I can buy into what you're saying
[23/01/2023, 00:50:19] Alex Regueiro: They're not real in any naturalist (certainly not physical) sense.
[23/01/2023, 00:50:26] Alice Lafferty: How GANs mimic evolution of biological organisms...
[23/01/2023, 00:51:18] Alex Regueiro: Very silly. As if we need technocracy pervading yet another cherished institution!
[23/01/2023, 00:51:43] Alice Lafferty: All neural nets are non-symbolic/sub-symbolic, right?
[23/01/2023, 00:51:53] Alex Regueiro: Why not go back to appointing cardinals from outside the priesthood at this rate?!
[23/01/2023, 00:52:00] Alex Regueiro: Yes, very much non-symbolic
[23/01/2023, 00:52:13] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much the opposite of symbolic AI, if one can say such a thing.
[23/01/2023, 00:53:05] Alex Regueiro: I played around with evolutionary algorithms yeeears ago (maybe when I was 17/18/19?)
[23/01/2023, 00:53:17] Alex Regueiro: Programmed a framework for them and ran some simulations. It was good fun.
[23/01/2023, 00:54:51] Alice Lafferty: I think it dovetails nicely with eliminative materialism. Ie most mental work is done 'automatically' and conscious symbol manipulation is actually an effect/epiphenomenon, or at least secondary.
[23/01/2023, 00:55:03] Alice Lafferty: I think I've used the 'steam coming off a train' metaphor before.
[23/01/2023, 00:55:37] Alice Lafferty: Is this when you designed your own neural net?
[23/01/2023, 00:56:02] Alex Regueiro: Yep, around the same time. I wanted to combine the two really, but don't think I ever got around to it. It was a rather simple neural net though, as almost all were at that time!
[23/01/2023, 00:56:02] Alice Lafferty: This also nullifies moral responsibilityüòà
[23/01/2023, 00:56:55] Alice Lafferty: What kind of stuff do you hope to work on in the future? Research?
[23/01/2023, 00:57:11] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'd agree it's somehow a higher-order phenomenon. Our brains really are not symbolic manipulators in their fundamental nature, and that's why even though computationlism in phil-mind hits on some truths, I don't really like the term or even the analogy.
[23/01/2023, 00:57:39] Alex Regueiro: Oh. If so I've forgotten it, sorry!
[23/01/2023, 00:58:24] Alice Lafferty: I think even Dennett promoted computationalism at one point but abandoned it.
[23/01/2023, 00:58:38] Alice Lafferty: It doesn't really work
[23/01/2023, 00:58:54] Alex Regueiro: Haha this makes it sound like you're about to go on a spree of unparalleled vice! And yet I know you're far too conscientious for that. üòâ
[23/01/2023, 00:59:10] Alex Regueiro: I didn't know that. He just cooled on the analogy basically?
[23/01/2023, 00:59:28] Alice Lafferty: I believe he's an illusionist now.
[23/01/2023, 00:59:40] Alice Lafferty: Which is basically type-B materialism.
[23/01/2023, 00:59:40] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I'd love to come back to that stuff, but I'm hardly well-educated in AI. Just a dabbler, and a rusty one at that.
[23/01/2023, 01:00:19] Alice Lafferty: Although I do query this. It wants to eliminate qualia yet if that is the case 'who/what' is experiencing the illusion... it creates like a cartesian theatre issue I think.
[23/01/2023, 01:00:26] Alice Lafferty: Which is a shame because I generally like him.
[23/01/2023, 01:00:41] Alex Regueiro: My split-second first reaction was... wait, Daniel Dennett has teamed up with David Blaine or something?! That's news to me!
[23/01/2023, 01:00:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I think compatabilism sort of works as a solution.
[23/01/2023, 01:00:56] Alex Regueiro: I know, I know...
[23/01/2023, 01:01:25] Alice Lafferty: Ha yeah. To be honest philosophical illusionism is not much more sensible...
[23/01/2023, 01:02:14] Alice Lafferty: I thought you had plans to kind of pivot that way, maybe you meant just as a hobby?
‚Äé[23/01/2023, 01:03:26] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/01/2023, 01:03:32] Alex Regueiro: Right hah
[23/01/2023, 01:03:41] Alice Lafferty: What did you use your neural net to do?
[23/01/2023, 01:04:16] Alex Regueiro: Well, I'm definitely still planning to study machine learning "properly", but I'm not sure it will lead into research (unfortunately). Will probably end up being a more practical-oriented appreciation.
[23/01/2023, 01:04:28] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's basically the same as eliminativism, but worse because it introduces a subject who has to experience the illusion.
[23/01/2023, 01:04:53] Alex Regueiro: I might tried a few things, but the one I remember is simple handwriting recognition of individual letters.
[23/01/2023, 01:05:30] Alice Lafferty: Ok that makes sense.
[23/01/2023, 01:05:36] Alex Regueiro: A tangential curiosity: macOS/iOS now seem to integrate text and handwriting recognition in images, and it works surprisingly well.
[23/01/2023, 01:06:01] Alice Lafferty: I've noticed this as well, it's fairly new, less than a year old I think?
[23/01/2023, 01:06:01] Alex Regueiro: Even with dodgy handwriting sometimes ha. And basically perfectly with typewritten stuff.
[23/01/2023, 01:06:14] Alice Lafferty: You can highlight text from an image and copy and paste it.
[23/01/2023, 01:06:18] Alice Lafferty: It's very useful!
[23/01/2023, 01:06:43] Alex Regueiro: I know... and does introducing the notion of an "illusion" (and having to specify it carefully) really help solve anything?
[23/01/2023, 01:06:59] Alice Lafferty: What kind of accuracy rate did you achieve
[23/01/2023, 01:07:01] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Maybe I just upgraded late, but I'd guess about 6 months?
[23/01/2023, 01:07:40] Alice Lafferty: I'm particularly interested in how AI interfaces between text and images.
[23/01/2023, 01:07:45] Alice Lafferty: And vice versa
[23/01/2023, 01:07:45] Alex Regueiro: Haha now you're really stretching the ability of my memory, given when I did this... I think it was pretty modest. Above 50% (70%) though?
[23/01/2023, 01:08:23] Alice Lafferty: That sounds pretty good to me! I have no idea what level of accuracy is considered acceptable.
[23/01/2023, 01:08:34] Alice Lafferty: What data did you use to train it?
[23/01/2023, 01:08:45] Alex Regueiro: One of the early applications of AI that actually quite impressed me was generating textual image descriptions automatically. (Google and photo websites like Flickr have been doing this for ages I think.)
[23/01/2023, 01:08:54] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly.
[23/01/2023, 01:09:09] Alice Lafferty: And stable diffusion generating really quite accurate images from text prompts.
[23/01/2023, 01:09:13] Alex Regueiro: The characters were pretty well-written to be honest. Not like my handwriting! Just some set of images I downloaded I think.
[23/01/2023, 01:09:22] Alex Regueiro: stable diffusion?
[23/01/2023, 01:09:42] Alice Lafferty: Apparently it 'tokenises' parts of words and links them to images.
[23/01/2023, 01:10:05] Alice Lafferty: The really impressive thing is that it can do prepositions/metaphors etc.
[23/01/2023, 01:10:33] Alice Lafferty: Not just word: 'hat' -> image of hat jpg.
[23/01/2023, 01:11:01] Alice Lafferty: An image generating AI
[23/01/2023, 01:11:06] Alice Lafferty: Similar to DALL-E
[23/01/2023, 01:11:14] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I was just going to ask...
[23/01/2023, 01:11:25] Alex Regueiro: But better at some things, like metaphors, perhaps?
[23/01/2023, 01:12:10] Alice Lafferty: And you can run it on like a macbook?
[23/01/2023, 01:12:17] Alex Regueiro: You'd be amazed how rudimentary NLP was until very recently. Still is in some ways. Tokenisation is so crude a methodology really. And the parsing is still half stuck in the land of symbolic AI...
[23/01/2023, 01:12:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh sure. I was using Windows XP or something back then.
[23/01/2023, 01:12:57] Alice Lafferty: I don't know, I would have thought it would struggle most with metaphors?
[23/01/2023, 01:13:11] Alex Regueiro: Terribly weak compared to my current MacBook, needless to say.
[23/01/2023, 01:13:49] Alex Regueiro: Although not quite the explosion in computational power since then that you saw between 1970 and 1990, say. The famous comparison of the Apollo 11 computer, for example...
[23/01/2023, 01:13:58] Alex Regueiro: I'd expect as much!
[23/01/2023, 01:14:08] Alice Lafferty: Obviously have only looked very shallowly into this but it appears not to use symbol manipulation at all, it's really just statistical closeness between input and output.
[23/01/2023, 01:14:16] Alice Lafferty: That's how it seems to me anywya
[23/01/2023, 01:14:18] Alice Lafferty: *anyway
[23/01/2023, 01:14:24] Alex Regueiro: (Banal question, but do you have a MacBook?)
[23/01/2023, 01:14:45] Alice Lafferty: Moorems law? Or is that a meme or something?
[23/01/2023, 01:14:54] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[23/01/2023, 01:15:02] Alex Regueiro: As far as I'm aware virtually all NLP is still a mixture of ML/statistical methods and symbolic ones. Or at least was until a few years ago.
[23/01/2023, 01:15:25] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure you're right
[23/01/2023, 01:15:47] Alex Regueiro: Comparisons like this: https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/11/21133119/usb-c-anker-charger-apollo-11-moon-landing-guidance-computer-more-powerful
[23/01/2023, 01:15:55] Alex Regueiro: The old one used to be with scientific calculators
[23/01/2023, 01:16:19] Alice Lafferty: Haha yeah, weren't they still basically using slide rules in the 50s
[23/01/2023, 01:16:27] Alice Lafferty: Incredible
[23/01/2023, 01:18:05] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much. Logarithm tables were in the handbook of every scientist and engineer!
[23/01/2023, 01:18:20] Alex Regueiro: My granddad taught me to use them because that's how he was trained hah.
[23/01/2023, 01:18:42] Alex Regueiro: There's sort of a lost art to them though
[23/01/2023, 01:18:50] Alex Regueiro: And other shortcuts/tricks of calculation
[23/01/2023, 01:19:52] Alice Lafferty: Wow
[23/01/2023, 01:20:11] Alice Lafferty: Do they have any utility that is lost by computers do you think?
[23/01/2023, 01:20:23] Alice Lafferty: To be fair you can do quite sophisticated stuff with like an abacus.
[23/01/2023, 01:20:26] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean exactly?
[23/01/2023, 01:20:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, so I've heard. That's definitely a lost art!
[23/01/2023, 01:20:53] Alice Lafferty: I mean is there anything being lost when these methods fall out of use?
[23/01/2023, 01:21:17] Alex Regueiro: The sort of tricks employed by logarithm tables sort of got incorporated into modern algorithms for computer arithmetic... I think it's fair to say that, though I don't really know the details.
[23/01/2023, 01:22:19] Alex Regueiro: Did you have any no-calculator exams at school and were still expected to do calculations? Some of my GCSEs were like that.
[23/01/2023, 01:22:25] Alice Lafferty: I see, so computers increase the efficiency of the calculations.
[23/01/2023, 01:22:56] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I didn't quite get the point of that I have to admit.
[23/01/2023, 01:23:18] Alice Lafferty: Was it just testing your ability to do mental arithmetic/long division on paper? :S

[23/01/2023, 01:24:56] Alex Regueiro: Yes, there are some really fancy algorithms for doing arithmetic operations as simple as multiplication extremely efficiently (in terms of computational time complexity, formally). I forget what the new record is now
[23/01/2023, 01:25:10] Alex Regueiro: O(n ^ 2.something) I think

[23/01/2023, 01:27:24] Alice Lafferty: It seems like speed is really the goal in computation.
[23/01/2023, 01:27:48] Alex Regueiro: Sure. Especially for fundamental and exceedingly common operations like multiplication
[23/01/2023, 01:27:59] Alice Lafferty: No, it's the Churchlands commenting on Searel's Chinese room (they introduced me to EM).
[23/01/2023, 01:28:32] Alice Lafferty: Basically the point they're trying to make is that cognition, when carried out at a certain speed and complexity, makes a phase transition into true consciousness.
[23/01/2023, 01:28:57] Alice Lafferty: But it is currently too slow for us to appreciate.
[23/01/2023, 01:29:26] Alex Regueiro: https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-discover-the-perfect-way-to-multiply-20190411/ if you're curious BTW
[23/01/2023, 01:29:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh right heh
[23/01/2023, 01:29:54] Alice Lafferty: Exam boards must have been under pressure for decades to get rid of the non-calculator part.
[23/01/2023, 01:30:09] Alex Regueiro: "Maxwell's theory of artificial luminance" doesn't sound like a term a physicist would use, which surprised me slightly!
[23/01/2023, 01:30:29] Alice Lafferty: Although I agree there's still some use to be got out of doing mental maths (for now....[ominously])
[23/01/2023, 01:31:15] Alice Lafferty: Ofc not... this is philosophy. You have to grant them 10 x more latitude with facts!
[23/01/2023, 01:31:45] Alex Regueiro: Ehh if that's what they're trying to show, it's a bit of a glib analogy, I'm afraid.
[23/01/2023, 01:32:16] Alex Regueiro: Only one order of magnitude... I thought you were more generous!
[23/01/2023, 01:32:46] Alice Lafferty: That is interesting that the way you learn at school is genuinely the quickest.
[23/01/2023, 01:32:47] Alex Regueiro: So we say when the pressure is all off. üôÇ But I agree yes. To some level at least.
[23/01/2023, 01:33:36] Alice Lafferty: Haha an age old question that nobody has been able to solve. 

>Karatsuba: 'after a *week* of searching...'
[23/01/2023, 01:33:41] Alex Regueiro: But it's not, and the article says as much! It's a good combination of simplicity and speed for the human mind though...
[23/01/2023, 01:33:49] Alex Regueiro: haha yes
[23/01/2023, 01:33:53] Alex Regueiro: bloody annoying geniuses
[23/01/2023, 01:34:00] Alice Lafferty: Oh I am only half way through!
[23/01/2023, 01:35:13] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I won't spoil any more of the surprise üòâ
[23/01/2023, 01:38:35] Alice Lafferty: Confused because it seems to work on the basis that addition/subtraction can be done faster than multiplication, but that multiplication has since equalised?
[23/01/2023, 01:39:29] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see, n √ó log n uses multiplicative steps.
[23/01/2023, 01:40:34] Alice Lafferty: I like that the insisted there must be a better solution because the current solution was not 'elegant' enough.
[23/01/2023, 01:44:35] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[23/01/2023, 01:44:54] Alex Regueiro: Honestly none of these solutions is remotely elegant, from what I can tell (without studying them properly)
[23/01/2023, 01:45:14] Alex Regueiro: Where did you see this?
[23/01/2023, 01:45:25] Alice Lafferty: Does 'elegant' just mean simple in this context?
[23/01/2023, 01:45:39] Alex Regueiro: It will never equalise, I think it's safe to say, but it's getting closer!
[23/01/2023, 01:46:06] Alice Lafferty: 'The speed gap between multiplication and addition has narrowed considerably over the past 20 years to the point where multiplication can be even faster than addition in some chip architectures.'
[23/01/2023, 01:46:12] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much. There's some element of mathematical / computational "beauty" involved too, perhaps, but "simplicity" is a good approximation.
[23/01/2023, 01:46:45] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. That's slightly misleading, because the time complexity (which is what computer scientists rather than engineers care about) is still strictly greater.
[23/01/2023, 01:47:03] Alex Regueiro: but certain chips are optimised for ultra-fast multiplication, yes
[23/01/2023, 01:47:05] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see. Yes it is pretty misleading
[23/01/2023, 01:47:23] Alice Lafferty: 'Time complexity' being...
[23/01/2023, 01:47:52] Alex Regueiro: Hah I've been waiting for you to ask that (since I mentioned it earlier)... this would be much easier to explain in person, but I can try here
[23/01/2023, 01:47:58] Alice Lafferty: Oh I just looked it up
[23/01/2023, 01:48:06] Alice Lafferty: It's certainly not like linear time
[23/01/2023, 01:48:09] Alex Regueiro: Actually, wait, I think I might have explained it very briefly at the pub!
[23/01/2023, 01:48:12] Alex Regueiro: Maybe.....?
[23/01/2023, 01:48:28] Alex Regueiro: linear time is written Oüëé
[23/01/2023, 01:48:31] Alex Regueiro: damnit
[23/01/2023, 01:48:34] Alex Regueiro: O(n)
[23/01/2023, 01:48:47] Alice Lafferty: Is this the difference between quadratic and polynomial factorisation?
[23/01/2023, 01:49:12] Alex Regueiro: Quadratics are just a type of polynomials.
[23/01/2023, 01:49:29] Alice Lafferty: Bleh polynomial and exponential
[23/01/2023, 01:50:25] Alice Lafferty: You did, I'm sure, now I'm working to remember it.
[23/01/2023, 01:51:18] Alex Regueiro: But you do talk of quadratic and polynomial time complexity. Like O(n^2) is quadratic. That's the complexity of the standard schoolbook multiplication algorithm. And the fastest multiplication algorithm being discussed here is sub-quatric. Approximately O(1.58) according to Wikipedia. Well, that's the Karasuba one.
[23/01/2023, 01:51:39] Alex Regueiro: I can very easily forgive you if you remember nothing of that. üôÇ
[23/01/2023, 01:52:02] Alex Regueiro: Wasn't quite the most enthralling part of our evening!
[23/01/2023, 01:52:14] Alice Lafferty: I am choosing to blame my slight drunkeness!
[23/01/2023, 01:52:36] Alex Regueiro: Basic idea is that you call "n" the size of the input data. It could be the magnitude of a number, or some more complex measure of the "size" of some data structure
[23/01/2023, 01:53:02] Alice Lafferty: No, I found it interesting, I think you introduced it to me at an intermediary level rather than beginner!
[23/01/2023, 01:53:05] Alice Lafferty: Not your fault obviously
[23/01/2023, 01:53:19] Alex Regueiro: The the time complexity is basically the formula for how many units of time it takes an algorithm to solve some problem in terms of n, the size of the input
[23/01/2023, 01:53:35] Alice Lafferty: Yes I do remember this.
[23/01/2023, 01:53:35] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, most likely. I have an unfortunate knack for that...
[23/01/2023, 01:54:08] Alex Regueiro: Better than offering a babyish patronising explanation though... I think?!
[23/01/2023, 01:54:23] Alice Lafferty: I agree
[23/01/2023, 01:54:26] Alex Regueiro: Yes that too. Pleasantly tipsy. The best kind of "drunk". üòÄ
[23/01/2023, 01:54:29] Alice Lafferty: It's not too complex actually.
[23/01/2023, 01:54:50] Alex Regueiro: No it's not. I could teach you the whole basics of the theory of time complexity in a few hours, I'm sure.
[23/01/2023, 01:55:15] Alex Regueiro: Of course, then there are some advanced parts, that I'm unaware of...
[23/01/2023, 01:55:29] Alice Lafferty: So re the 'time complexity' of multiplication, it is still lower than that achieved for addition.
[23/01/2023, 01:55:48] Alex Regueiro: A vast last of unexplored territory. Like in most fields, one sadly finds out... even the fields one might "specialise" in!
[23/01/2023, 01:56:02] Alex Regueiro: Higher time complexity. i.e. slow
[23/01/2023, 01:56:04] Alex Regueiro: slower*
[23/01/2023, 01:56:40] Alice Lafferty: 'sadly' - or maybe excitingly? Frontiersmanship and such
[23/01/2023, 01:56:50] Alice Lafferty: Oh sorry, I see.
[23/01/2023, 01:57:53] Alex Regueiro: I just mean that it's a slight disappointing day when you realise you'll never know close to everything even in some very particular field of human knowledge. This has always been true to some extent, but in 2023 the possibility of the Renaissance man is truly dead!
[23/01/2023, 01:58:02] Alice Lafferty: So exponential complexity is 'lower' than polynomial.
[23/01/2023, 01:58:27] Alex Regueiro: But you're right, it's exhilarating in another sense. Daunting, awe-inspiring, depressing, discouraging... all these things.
[23/01/2023, 01:58:37] Alex Regueiro: Higher, again. (Sorry!)
[23/01/2023, 01:58:48] Alice Lafferty: Yes true! In order to become truly proficient in your field, you have to create increasingly specific sub-sub-sub fields.
[23/01/2023, 01:58:49] Alex Regueiro: The best way to think of these things is to picture the graphs
[23/01/2023, 01:59:01] Alice Lafferty: üòê
[23/01/2023, 01:59:22] Alex Regueiro: of e.g. n^2 or n^3 or n^4 (polynomial) vs e.g. 2^n or 3^n (exponential)
[23/01/2023, 01:59:26] Alex Regueiro: where n is on the x axis
[23/01/2023, 01:59:51] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[23/01/2023, 01:59:54] Alex Regueiro: The exponential might start out slower, but eventually it is guaranteed to outstrip any polynomial function, by far. This can be formalised mathematically of course
[23/01/2023, 02:00:03] Alex Regueiro: Exactly
[23/01/2023, 02:00:17] Alice Lafferty: I think I literally read this the wrong way round, sorry
[23/01/2023, 02:01:01] Alex Regueiro: And why there's some joy to be had in that, I think there's also a sadness to becoming such a minutely specialised expert. Perhaps why I could never really bear the idea, since becoming aware of the great realms of knowledge out there!
[23/01/2023, 02:01:37] Alice Lafferty: Jack of all trades, master of none...
[23/01/2023, 02:01:39] Alex Regueiro: No worries at all. Honestly, getting something literally the wrong way round is both an easy mistake and far from the worst one to make.
[23/01/2023, 02:02:09] Alice Lafferty: I think it's because in conventional speech 'high' maps onto 'fast'
[23/01/2023, 02:03:06] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's the other risk! I try to straddle the boundary between ultra-generalist and ultra-specialist, but sometimes it feels like walking a tightrope. Contemporary socioeconomics very much favours the extreme specialist... with a precious few exceptions.
[23/01/2023, 02:03:12] Alice Lafferty: I don't think this is a bad thing though by the way
[23/01/2023, 02:03:20] Alex Regueiro: Yep probably
[23/01/2023, 02:04:34] Alex Regueiro: I was so focused and narrow-minded (in both the positive and negative senses) until I was 16, or even 18 or 19 perhaps, that I sort of overreacted in the opposite direction, and have sort of been seesawing back and forth since, trying to settle on an equilibrium. üôÇ
[23/01/2023, 02:04:43] Alice Lafferty: Yes, if you could leave aside social reward, you do genuinely seem to have a wide rather than narrow range of interests.
[23/01/2023, 02:04:50] Alex Regueiro: How about you? How would you characterise yourself... and has it changed over time?
[23/01/2023, 02:04:53] Alice Lafferty: Which is the opposite of the autism neurotype.
[23/01/2023, 02:05:09] Alice Lafferty: Oh sorry I only just saw this. Interesting!
[23/01/2023, 02:05:39] Alex Regueiro: Very much so, though there are certain subjects or matters I can rule out very quickly. I mean, have ruled out and will continue to do so as I discover new ones.
[23/01/2023, 02:06:05] Alice Lafferty: What things can you read about/do whilst experiencing minimal resistance or distraction?
[23/01/2023, 02:06:23] Alex Regueiro: Good question
[23/01/2023, 02:06:29] Alex Regueiro: As in get into a flow state?
[23/01/2023, 02:06:33] Alice Lafferty: I mean did you 'force' yourself to become interested in other things?
[23/01/2023, 02:06:39] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[23/01/2023, 02:07:35] Alex Regueiro: Definitely in part. Some of it was natural broadening out. Insatiable curiosity that just developed. Other branching out was a result of previous complete ignorance, and therefore definitely a deep-seated insecurity.
[23/01/2023, 02:09:30] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. In terms of intellectual domains or jobs I presume you mean? Programming, maths (at least most of the time), sometimes writing...
[23/01/2023, 02:10:06] Alice Lafferty: This is one of my most embarrassing admissions actually, but I've found recently I'm totally unable to differentiate between 'authentic' interests and sort of socially aspirational ones.
[23/01/2023, 02:10:46] Alex Regueiro: Truthfully, I can sympathise
[23/01/2023, 02:10:54] Alex Regueiro: I've grappled with that very interest on numerous occasions in the past.
[23/01/2023, 02:11:05] Alice Lafferty: I think lack of internal resistance or 'flow states' are a good metric to measure 'true' interests and dispositions.
[23/01/2023, 02:11:07] Alex Regueiro: Only recently start to really come to grips with it!
[23/01/2023, 02:11:52] Alex Regueiro: Agreed, though sometimes it's hard to gauge if procrastination or pressure or laziness is creating a mental block despite authentic interest.
[23/01/2023, 02:12:05] Alice Lafferty: I'm not casting aspersions on the fact that you enjoy maths and programming by the way, it seems very likely that you enjoy them in a culture-independent way.
[23/01/2023, 02:12:42] Alex Regueiro: Oh I didn't think you were... though now you have me wondering. üßê
[23/01/2023, 02:13:11] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever got into like a slightly compulsive or hypomanic state (obviously not indicating actual BPD) when doing some task?
[23/01/2023, 02:13:40] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I also struggle with that a lot.
[23/01/2023, 02:14:05] Alice Lafferty: Haha praying againüôÑ
[23/01/2023, 02:14:15] Alice Lafferty: I did just discover you can remove them though.
[23/01/2023, 02:14:22] Alex Regueiro: But don't worry, really. My interests and predilections and hobbies are something I'm not at all insecure about these days. After all, I'm both the best and worst example of a nerd you can find, depending how you look at me!
[23/01/2023, 02:14:29] Alex Regueiro: Noo
[23/01/2023, 02:14:53] Alex Regueiro: Now say 10 Hail Mary's for that. üò†
[23/01/2023, 02:15:26] Alice Lafferty: I think so because you have a really broad and actually quite sensitive interest in the arts I think. Which your stereotypical nerd lacks.
[23/01/2023, 02:15:57] Alex Regueiro: You're on a journey of discovery. You're still very young, so you really must give yourself permission to be that way.
[23/01/2023, 02:16:11] Alex Regueiro: You have the self-awareness of the issue, which is arguably the most important step.
[23/01/2023, 02:16:45] Alex Regueiro: Thank you. That's kind of you to say. And yes, I hope that's one thing... also a vague (but not intense) interest in sports hah
[23/01/2023, 02:17:05] Alex Regueiro: And not having a meek retiring personality in some ways probably sets me apart as well...
[23/01/2023, 02:17:09] Alice Lafferty: Pretty much the only thing I will credit myself with is being fairly self-aware yes. But obviously I still have blind spots.
[23/01/2023, 02:17:24] Alex Regueiro: Equally, I'm a doubtless introvert. A sociable one if you're lucky, but an introvert one all the same.
[23/01/2023, 02:18:01] Alex Regueiro: Definitely. I'm familiar with both those things!
[23/01/2023, 02:18:23] Alice Lafferty: ? I'm curious about this because I've been trying to a) identify precisely what problems trigger this state.
[23/01/2023, 02:18:28] Alex Regueiro: I'm not bipolar, though I do think I'm familiar with hypomania.
[23/01/2023, 02:18:35] Alice Lafferty: Oh haha you just answered
[23/01/2023, 02:18:58] Alice Lafferty: No, I don't mean it in the clinical sense at all, I just couldn't think of a better word.
[23/01/2023, 02:19:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes this is true.
[23/01/2023, 02:20:22] Alice Lafferty: Haha you are sounding a bit lifestyle-coachish!
[23/01/2023, 02:20:27] Alex Regueiro: Oh don't worry, even if you were, I wouldn't take any offence at it.
[23/01/2023, 02:20:59] Alex Regueiro: I know haha... part of me recoils at these things as soon as I type them. But it's damn hard not to express them as platitudes!
[23/01/2023, 02:21:39] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I've had my own mental health issues in my time, god knows... just thankfully massive mood swings aren't one of them heh.
[23/01/2023, 02:21:54] Alex Regueiro: To avoid or embrace ha?
[23/01/2023, 02:22:00] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I experience it for long enough to be considered a true 'manic' episodes, a few hours max. Plus I never act particularly impulsively/destructively.
[23/01/2023, 02:22:30] Alex Regueiro: Definitely sounds like hypomania then (not necessarily "clinical" either), but an apt description nevertheless.
[23/01/2023, 02:22:36] Alice Lafferty: Some platitudes are useful to hear! That's why they've survived so long.
[23/01/2023, 02:22:55] Alice Lafferty: Something more like unipolar depression?
[23/01/2023, 02:23:21] Alice Lafferty: Embrace! I find it quite enjoyable. And I'm never more productive.
[23/01/2023, 02:23:40] Alex Regueiro: As long as you know I mean them. I genuinely want to see you fulfil your potential, because I know how intelligent you are. (And plus, you're a friend...)
[23/01/2023, 02:24:05] Alice Lafferty: Haha thank you
[23/01/2023, 02:24:07] Alex Regueiro: Yes haha. Same to an extent. Just have to be careful it doesn't become full-blown mania!
[23/01/2023, 02:25:08] Alex Regueiro: Yes, secondarily. All a result of anxiety really. I think I hinted at this very soon after we met but never really went into details. I'm not averse to, but probably easier done in person. üòä
[23/01/2023, 02:25:32] Alice Lafferty: Eh, I feel quite confident that for me it won't come to that. There's nothing of it in my family and I am always pulled back to what is my essentially low-energy baseline.
[23/01/2023, 02:25:59] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I've known a few genuine bipolars and safe to say I've no desire to embrace that!
[23/01/2023, 02:26:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I think your inherent predisposition is the main factor by far, so if you know that...
[23/01/2023, 02:26:37] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see, that makes sense. You don't have to if you don't want to but I've experienced/experience something very similar.
[23/01/2023, 02:27:19] Alice Lafferty: What tends to induce this kind of state for you, is it solving programming problems?
[23/01/2023, 02:27:59] Alice Lafferty: Really, I haven't to my knowledge. But yeah it looks like it can be really life-limiting.
[23/01/2023, 02:28:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. Well, feel free to elaborate if you fancy... you'd probably get me to share right now too, anyway
[23/01/2023, 02:28:47] Alex Regueiro: Honestly it can be the randomnest little things. Enjoying problem solving or puzzles is more a result than a cause of these 'hypomanic' states.
[23/01/2023, 02:29:28] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough it's often social or sensory overstimulation that puts me into these states. If it's just moderate stimulation, then I find it really beneficial. I have to be careful not to let it go too far, that's all.
[23/01/2023, 02:30:52] Alice Lafferty: For me, I think it's just run-of-the-mill anxiety that you see every second person diagnosed with. I'm quite neurotic, heightened sensitivity especially to negative social interactions. Is it something similar for you?
[23/01/2023, 02:32:35] Alice Lafferty: That is really interesting as it quite the opposite for me! Socialising is absolutely draining and I have to go about exerting barely any energy for the next 24 hours before I can even approach an mental task.
[23/01/2023, 02:33:32] Alice Lafferty: I usually am able to hyper-focus only when I am extremely relaxed, peaceful, low-stimulus environment etc.
[23/01/2023, 02:34:40] Alice Lafferty: Being 'energised' by socialising is an extroversion trait, which is interesting. Maybe they're not totally binary after all.
[23/01/2023, 02:34:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, not dissimilar. I think we talked about the "highly sensitive person" label before a bit, and it definitely applies to me, even though I have lots of strategies for coping with or mitigating it. It's kind of hard to pin down the anxiety with me, but they talk about "anxiety spectrum disorder" these days, and I actually think that's a good thing. So for me it's a bit of GAD, a bit of OCD, a bit of social anxiety (much more so when I was young).
[23/01/2023, 02:35:39] Alex Regueiro: Yes indeed. It's a funny one. I don't think it's linear. There's a goldilocks zone for me with just a bit of socialising (not too intense or too frequent) that stimulates me in a good way. Less and I can become lethargic, more and I can burn out easily!
[23/01/2023, 02:35:42] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes I remember. Adoption of these labels can definitely be a good thing if they lead you towards coping strategies.
[23/01/2023, 02:35:52] Alex Regueiro: I 100% get this
[23/01/2023, 02:36:44] Alice Lafferty: I've experienced a bit of what I believe to be OCD too, but to be honest I am reluctant to formally add it to the roster of diagnoses.
[23/01/2023, 02:36:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I mean, it's not just self-diagnosis. Suffice to say I don't have extreme cases of any of these things, but they're 'clinically present' nevertheless!
[23/01/2023, 02:37:35] Alice Lafferty: That actually makes more sense than the polarity of the pop psychology concept.
[23/01/2023, 02:37:46] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. Or could be a little of what they call "OCPD"? It can take so many forms in truth...
[23/01/2023, 02:38:18] Alice Lafferty: Your socialising goldilocks zone might be slightly higher than mine, but I'm sure I have one too.
[23/01/2023, 02:38:23] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I reckon so. This my own model that I've arrived upon, but at least it works pretty well for managing my own life and interactions.
[23/01/2023, 02:38:47] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see. Sorry, I'm so used to talking to people who have self-diagnosed with GAD!
[23/01/2023, 02:38:48] Alex Regueiro: I suspect it is, yes. Still below average, but marginally higher than yours perhaps...
[23/01/2023, 02:39:00] Alice Lafferty: Have you been offered/taken any medication for it?
[23/01/2023, 02:39:19] Alice Lafferty: Is this a personality disorder? Potentially?
[23/01/2023, 02:39:27] Alex Regueiro: It's one of the hazy conditions (it's called "generalised" after all!) that's so tempting for people to self-diagnose, but yeah, I do have it.
[23/01/2023, 02:40:01] Alice Lafferty: How long ago was this?
[23/01/2023, 02:40:10] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I kind of wince at the term "personality disorder", but I just mean to say maybe it's more an obsessive/compulsive-type personality, if you will, than OCD. Just musing. Could be either!
[23/01/2023, 02:40:48] Alex Regueiro: Oh years and years ago. Not that I doubt it applies to me still.
[23/01/2023, 02:41:14] Alex Regueiro: First in my late teens I think?
[23/01/2023, 02:41:22] Alice Lafferty: It's surprising in a way there's hasn't been a movement to destigmatise personality disorders, ie. personality diversity or something
[23/01/2023, 02:41:56] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. That does seem to be when a lot of the issues that arise at puberty come to a head.
[23/01/2023, 02:42:10] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure I told you my parents actually took me to a psychologist when I was about 14, because my mum thought I might have Asperger's at that time. Psychologist said no though!
[23/01/2023, 02:42:24] Alice Lafferty: I think you did tell me this yes!
[23/01/2023, 02:42:41] Alice Lafferty: And who'd have thought that it would actually be me who ends up getting a diagnosis.
[23/01/2023, 02:43:03] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, all the shitty things about oneself greet you with puberty! I never understand how so many people say their teens were their best years.
[23/01/2023, 02:43:42] Alex Regueiro: Thought I might have. If I had seen him more than once he might have realised even then I had stuff on the anxiety spectrum, but yeah...
[23/01/2023, 02:43:55] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure you no longer have the report but it'd be so interesting to see what kind of scores you got. Even though you will have changed a lot since then.
[23/01/2023, 02:44:12] Alex Regueiro: Hah. You mean you/your parents never suspected until you got diagnosed? I think you told me *you* didn't think of yourself that way before it happened...
[23/01/2023, 02:44:16] Alice Lafferty: Me neither!
[23/01/2023, 02:45:05] Alice Lafferty: That's right. My parents (mum) very much pushed it. I suspect a bit of bandwagonning on her part.
[23/01/2023, 02:45:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it would be hah. Feel free to give me one. Birthday present? üòâ
[23/01/2023, 02:45:36] Alice Lafferty: Yes, so you didn't get diagnosed with anything on that occasion?
[23/01/2023, 02:45:40] Alex Regueiro: Nope
[23/01/2023, 02:45:44] Alex Regueiro: Was only years later
[23/01/2023, 02:46:12] Alex Regueiro: Some rather painful teenage years... though not without the occasional pleasure!
[23/01/2023, 02:46:38] Alice Lafferty: You could probably get a screening on the NHS, just out of curiosity
[23/01/2023, 02:46:55] Alex Regueiro: Oh I was thinking just one of those tests you download onlien and print off
[23/01/2023, 02:46:58] Alice Lafferty: Not to seek a diagnosis, but the process itself is quite interesting
[23/01/2023, 02:46:58] Alex Regueiro: hence purely a joke
[23/01/2023, 02:47:12] Alice Lafferty: Oh those are awful.
[23/01/2023, 02:47:41] Alex Regueiro: Some are, but some are official (endorsed by psychological boards) and the very same ones used by clinical psychologists.
[23/01/2023, 02:47:50] Alice Lafferty: I hold them directly culpable for the explosion of teenagers self dxing with autism.
[23/01/2023, 02:48:13] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, they definitely have their dark side in that regard...
[23/01/2023, 02:48:20] Alex Regueiro: Though I think it's a broader problem with online culture
[23/01/2023, 02:48:35] Alice Lafferty: Yeah but the average user can't distinguish them from the one created by a buzzfeed writer.
[23/01/2023, 02:49:00] Alex Regueiro: And a sort of narcissistic fetishisation of these disorders that has become immensely popular in the last couple of decades.
[23/01/2023, 02:49:07] Alex Regueiro: True this
[23/01/2023, 02:49:16] Alex Regueiro: Buzzfeed üò≠
[23/01/2023, 02:49:17] Alice Lafferty: Also, autism is not diagnosed on the basis of self-report.
[23/01/2023, 02:49:39] Alice Lafferty: You have to interact with a psychiatrist in person and they judge your social responses.
[23/01/2023, 02:49:39] Alex Regueiro: Right. Some things can be (at least to a large extent), but not autism!
[23/01/2023, 02:50:31] Alex Regueiro: Like I've said to you on multiple occasions though, I think the diagnosis in your case is only of limited use. Perhaps it makes you more aware of certain neurological and personality traits, which may help with managing your life, relationships, and career. But beyond that I doubt it's something you need to get too worked up about.
[23/01/2023, 02:50:57] Alice Lafferty: The more I think about it the more I think it's infantilisation in particular. There's a charming kind of childish innocence/freedom associated with autism etc that is highly appealing.
[23/01/2023, 02:51:00] Alex Regueiro: At least, something like that is what I meant to have said...
[23/01/2023, 02:51:43] Alice Lafferty: I agree. I did go through a phase of trying to brute force every experience I've ever had into the autism schema.
[23/01/2023, 02:51:49] Alice Lafferty: But it didn't work.
[23/01/2023, 02:52:40] Alex Regueiro: Good point. I think there's some real merit to that, though it's not occurred to me in that way before. But the traits of so many autists fit that mould so well, come to think of it... and we live in an ever more complex and depersonalised world (there's another true clich√© for you) that it's even more appealing to many.
[23/01/2023, 02:53:47] Alex Regueiro: Good. It's only natural to try that, but seeing your world (or "the" world) through the lens of a single theory is a terrible way to live.
[23/01/2023, 02:53:51] Alex Regueiro: A false way, indeed
[23/01/2023, 02:54:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Part of the general deferred adulthood too.
[23/01/2023, 02:55:13] Alice Lafferty: I did read a theory recently that young people are like this because they were put in day care and as a result are insecurely attached :S
[23/01/2023, 02:55:23] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Though slightly deferring some aspects of adulthood... nothing necessarily wrong with that. But you don't want to defer basic emotional maturation, resilience, etc.
[23/01/2023, 02:55:36] Alice Lafferty: It's a bit like, Freudian and I'm not sure whether there's been a clinical trial.
[23/01/2023, 02:56:01] Alex Regueiro: How curious. I mean, it might play a small role, but I can't imagine it's a major factor. Lasch would love that though! He rails against daycare at one point ha.
[23/01/2023, 02:56:17] Alex Regueiro: (Did you go to daycare?)
[23/01/2023, 02:57:04] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, it's a pretty popular theme on parts of the right.
[23/01/2023, 02:57:29] Alice Lafferty: I went to nursery, but that was when I was over a year old.
[23/01/2023, 02:57:42] Alex Regueiro: Yes. The outsourcing of parental duties, the lack of community-based socialisation of youngsters. He hates that.
[23/01/2023, 02:57:52] Alex Regueiro: Right
[23/01/2023, 02:58:03] Alex Regueiro: I think I just went to preschool? Didn't last long though haha, I hated irt.
[23/01/2023, 02:58:05] Alex Regueiro: it
[23/01/2023, 02:58:06] Alice Lafferty: I think they are referring specifically to the instance of like 6 week old babies being put in daycare, which apparently happens in the US.
[23/01/2023, 02:58:21] Alex Regueiro: My mum could tell you some good stories about my brief experience in preschool.
[23/01/2023, 02:58:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's almost criminal at 6 weeks old. And it's not like having a wetnurse either.
[23/01/2023, 02:58:50] Alice Lafferty: Yep. I'm familiar with these sorts of arguments but haven't looked too far into the evidence.
[23/01/2023, 02:59:01] Alex Regueiro: Nor have I in truth
[23/01/2023, 02:59:11] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I think that's quite different.
[23/01/2023, 02:59:28] Alex Regueiro: All I can so far is "prima facie very plausible", but the degree of importance is up for debate.
[23/01/2023, 02:59:37] Alice Lafferty: ? Under what circumstances did you leave?
[23/01/2023, 02:59:57] Alice Lafferty: Involuntarily?
[23/01/2023, 03:00:19] Alice Lafferty: I don't mean that you were EXPELLED from preschool.
[23/01/2023, 03:00:22] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[23/01/2023, 03:00:30] Alex Regueiro: Oh, the people running it were just useless. Plus, I preferred to sit in the corner playing with my Lego (Duplo?) rather than games with the other kids.
[23/01/2023, 03:00:37] Alice Lafferty: Agree
[23/01/2023, 03:01:03] Alice Lafferty: Didn't they just leave you be?
[23/01/2023, 03:01:33] Alex Regueiro: That would take a bad-boy of prodigious scale!
[23/01/2023, 03:02:36] Alice Lafferty: I'm pretty sure it happens - can exhibit antisocial behaviour really young. And there are indeed a preponderance of boys in that category.
[23/01/2023, 03:03:21] Alex Regueiro: I forget what happened exactly, but my mum thought they were utterly useless and I was apparently pretty miserable!
[23/01/2023, 03:03:55] Alex Regueiro: She knows the details that would make it an actual interesting story, but I completely forget.
[23/01/2023, 03:04:26] Alice Lafferty: Well that was good of her to take you out I guess? She wasn't working at that time?
[23/01/2023, 03:04:52] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if you even have proper memory formation at that age...
[23/01/2023, 03:05:11] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, though I still don't know what a preschooler would have to do to get expelled haha. I'd imagine even the majority of the typical arseholes you get in secondary school weren't yet fully developed delinquents by the age of 2 or 3!
[23/01/2023, 03:05:23] Alex Regueiro: I don't. I'm relying entirely on her account.
[23/01/2023, 03:05:41] Alex Regueiro: My first legitimate memory is just before 4, at earliest.
[23/01/2023, 03:06:07] Alex Regueiro: Nope, since my sister had just been born
[23/01/2023, 03:06:11] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, although I imagine you'd be asked to leave if you harmed one of the other children, even in a minor way.
[23/01/2023, 03:06:52] Alex Regueiro: Maybe? Depends how badly I suppose. I'd expect they'd give out warnings and stern words with the parents first.
[23/01/2023, 03:07:20] Alice Lafferty: I actually do have a memory from nursery, so 3 maybe? (And I know it's not one reconstructed from a photo because it's a view looking up from the floor).
[23/01/2023, 03:07:37] Alex Regueiro: You were hardly the typical redheaded tearaway, were you?
[23/01/2023, 03:07:56] Alex Regueiro: Oh that's pretty early. üôÇ
[23/01/2023, 03:07:58] Alice Lafferty: But yeah generally really blurry and largely false I imagine, until 6 or 7.
[23/01/2023, 03:08:44] Alex Regueiro: One I definitely know wasn't fabricated was my first day at school. So I was 4 and 3 months. But I think I have two or three before that, even hazier.
[23/01/2023, 03:08:51] Alice Lafferty: When I was a child I actually did fit the stereotype unfortunately... not 'a tearaway' but just quite a disagreeable child.
[23/01/2023, 03:09:09] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah? In what way?
[23/01/2023, 03:09:19] Alex Regueiro: I want examples!
[23/01/2023, 03:09:39] Alice Lafferty: I don't remember my first day of school at all! Although there are pictures
[23/01/2023, 03:10:51] Alex Regueiro: I bet you were cute enough to get off the hook usually though!
[23/01/2023, 03:11:20] Alice Lafferty: Oh just kind of grumpy and argumentative. 'Stroppy' is the word my mum uses.
[23/01/2023, 03:11:33] Alex Regueiro: Ah fair enough.
[23/01/2023, 03:11:49] Alex Regueiro: Stroppy... one of those quintessentially British words. Apt though.
[23/01/2023, 03:12:06] Alice Lafferty: No! I was kind of odd-looking, but you're right that that makes a huge difference to the licence a child gets.
[23/01/2023, 03:12:46] Alice Lafferty: It is, and specifically of the 2000s somehow. 'Narked' meaning angry is another one - did you ever get that?
[23/01/2023, 03:13:11] Alex Regueiro: Now if I were feeling waggish I'd say, "so nothing's changed"... but no, that's not fair!
[23/01/2023, 03:13:26] Alice Lafferty: You've got me looking through a box for old photos now.
[23/01/2023, 03:13:35] Alex Regueiro: You've just sublimated that tendency into fondness for a good debate, which is excellent. üòÄ
[23/01/2023, 03:13:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha it would be totally fair
[23/01/2023, 03:14:06] Alex Regueiro: 90s too, for sure. I don't think I've ever heard "narked" much!
[23/01/2023, 03:14:08] Alex Regueiro: Occasionally
[23/01/2023, 03:14:38] Alex Regueiro: Oh, will you show me? Please do, if you find one.
[23/01/2023, 03:14:54] Alice Lafferty: There's one I'm looking for in particular.
[23/01/2023, 03:15:05] Alice Lafferty: Do you want to exchange childhood photos
[23/01/2023, 03:15:18] Alice Lafferty: What did young Alex look like?
[23/01/2023, 03:15:34] Alex Regueiro: My sister was the stroppy one. (Still is, to some degree, you could say!) I was quite placid actually. Apparently I barely even cried as a baby.
[23/01/2023, 03:15:40] Alice Lafferty: By the way I have told you my brother's name is also Alex, right?
[23/01/2023, 03:16:00] Alice Lafferty: To be fair it is a word used mostly to describe girls
[23/01/2023, 03:16:13] Alice Lafferty: Like 'bossy'
[23/01/2023, 03:16:15] Alex Regueiro: Ok, one sec, I'll find one that got scanned... there are a bunch of nice quaint ones lying around in albums though.
[23/01/2023, 03:16:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah true. Like "tearaway" is mostly used for boys.
[23/01/2023, 03:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Or "rascal"
[23/01/2023, 03:16:43] Alice Lafferty: Hm that's interesting. I apparently screeched like hell.
[23/01/2023, 03:16:43] Alex Regueiro: No!
[23/01/2023, 03:16:47] Alex Regueiro: That's cool. Which one?
[23/01/2023, 03:17:00] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes, the youngest.
[23/01/2023, 03:17:13] Alex Regueiro: I see!
[23/01/2023, 03:17:26] Alice Lafferty: Which would have made things a bit interesting had we dated!
[23/01/2023, 03:18:21] Alex Regueiro: (Wouldn't have necessarily guessed it)
[23/01/2023, 03:18:40] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes
[23/01/2023, 03:18:53] Alex Regueiro: Not as bad as your mum's/dad's name though...
[23/01/2023, 03:19:01] Alice Lafferty: If I find a good picture I will send it to you
[23/01/2023, 03:19:37] Alex Regueiro: I actually have to confess, sometimes I would swipe left just because a woman had my mum's name. üòë
[23/01/2023, 03:19:47] Alex Regueiro: Tinge of awkwardness
[23/01/2023, 03:19:51] Alice Lafferty: Huh, I think it's not as bad actually, because you don't refer to your parents by their first names. What are your parents' names?
[23/01/2023, 03:20:02] Alice Lafferty: Oh haha is it quite common?
[23/01/2023, 03:20:47] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, but... remember that name is one you might be whispering tenderly or calling out in passion in the future so...
[23/01/2023, 03:20:57] Alex Regueiro: Amy
[23/01/2023, 03:21:07] Alex Regueiro: How about yours?
[23/01/2023, 03:21:27] Alice Lafferty: That is surprisingly youthful. It feels like an 80s/90s name.
[23/01/2023, 03:21:34] Alice Lafferty: She must have bucked the trend.
[23/01/2023, 03:21:53] Alex Regueiro: He's the one very similar to you right?
[23/01/2023, 03:22:07] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes, you'd just have to constantly skirt around it by using a pet name.
[23/01/2023, 03:22:11] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Seem to be a lot of women of my generation with the name.... alas.
[23/01/2023, 03:22:23] Alex Regueiro: Yep!
[23/01/2023, 03:22:47] Alice Lafferty: Yep. Same first syllable (a bad choice on my parents part imo).
[23/01/2023, 03:23:24] Alice Lafferty: My mum is Elizabeth (but Liz) and my dad is Andre (NOT Andy).
[23/01/2023, 03:23:31] Alice Lafferty: *andrew!
[23/01/2023, 03:24:07] Alex Regueiro: Not as bad as the three As in my family, as I think I mentioned... just as well we didn't turn out to be alcoholics!
[23/01/2023, 03:24:15] Alex Regueiro: (Well, the American organisation)
[23/01/2023, 03:24:27] Alice Lafferty: How has OKCupiding been going?
[23/01/2023, 03:24:36] Alex Regueiro: Haha I was going to say, Andre is a bit... ghetto?
[23/01/2023, 03:24:42] Alex Regueiro: They're nice names
[23/01/2023, 03:24:51] Alice Lafferty: Haha, or French
[23/01/2023, 03:24:59] Alex Regueiro: True!
[23/01/2023, 03:25:13] Alex Regueiro: Or Dr Dre...
[23/01/2023, 03:25:28] Alex Regueiro: My dad was born Allen, but changed it to Alano to make for a better stage name when he was going to be a concert pianist... kept it after all
[23/01/2023, 03:25:57] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough my mum's siblings all got very traditional names apart from her. And her parents had traditional ones too.
[23/01/2023, 03:25:58] Alice Lafferty: That is fascinating. Usually people try to anglicise their name.
[23/01/2023, 03:26:14] Alex Regueiro: Yep, but this was in the US...
[23/01/2023, 03:26:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes, even more so there right?
[23/01/2023, 03:27:08] Alex Regueiro: In the past yep. But these days not so much

[23/01/2023, 03:27:34] Alex Regueiro: There you go!
[23/01/2023, 03:27:40] Alice Lafferty: What the hell, you were blond!
[23/01/2023, 03:27:53] Alex Regueiro: These are ones my sis sent me a few years ago... for my 30th I think?
[23/01/2023, 03:27:57] Alex Regueiro: Yeah haha
[23/01/2023, 03:28:23] Alex Regueiro: Was blond until I was 6 or 7 I think. It darkened over time until my mid teens.
[23/01/2023, 03:28:45] Alice Lafferty: They are very cute, but I have to say I don't see a strong resemblance to adult you. I guess not everyone has one.
[23/01/2023, 03:29:03] Alex Regueiro: I agree, I've changed a lot!
[23/01/2023, 03:29:06] Alex Regueiro: But thanks
[23/01/2023, 03:29:12] Alice Lafferty: We'd hope so
[23/01/2023, 03:29:28] Alice Lafferty: And you look pretty happy.
‚Äé[23/01/2023, 03:29:32] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/01/2023, 03:29:36] Alice Lafferty: I will send you some of me if I can find them
[23/01/2023, 03:30:05] Alex Regueiro: That's another thing I've been told... I was one of the happiest children anyone knew! So not just my parents saying it.
[23/01/2023, 03:30:08] Alice Lafferty: Kind of... although now my attention is drawn to the fact that your hair used to be dead straight too!
[23/01/2023, 03:30:17] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes
[23/01/2023, 03:30:27] Alex Regueiro: Two things happened to my hair: it got much darker and it got much wavier.
[23/01/2023, 03:30:49] Alice Lafferty: That is a wonderful thing to have said about you I think.
[23/01/2023, 03:31:13] Alice Lafferty: Testosterone will do that..
[23/01/2023, 03:31:37] Alex Regueiro: Yes, it even makes the cynical realist adult I am smile sometimes. üôÇ
[23/01/2023, 03:31:45] Alex Regueiro: Yes, and makes it recede / fall out...
[23/01/2023, 03:32:27] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, I didn't notice that on you. But I never notice men's hairlines as much as they seem to.
[23/01/2023, 03:33:02] Alice Lafferty: I was kind of reading about this because there's a booming industry for MPB treatments and preventatives.
[23/01/2023, 03:33:16] Alex Regueiro: It's receded a bit, for sure, but then I always had a fairly high hairline...
[23/01/2023, 03:33:23] Alex Regueiro: MPB?
[23/01/2023, 03:33:25] Alex Regueiro: oh yes
[23/01/2023, 03:33:26] Alice Lafferty: It appears to be caused be DHEA sensitivity?
[23/01/2023, 03:33:28] Alex Regueiro: pattern baldness
[23/01/2023, 03:33:29] Alex Regueiro: yep
[23/01/2023, 03:33:53] Alex Regueiro: Is that di-hydro-testosterone? If so yes.
[23/01/2023, 03:34:01] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, that's probably just normal.
[23/01/2023, 03:34:25] Alice Lafferty: Fortunately you haven't developed a neurosis about the way some men have?
[23/01/2023, 03:34:51] Alice Lafferty: Dehydroepiandrosterone :S
[23/01/2023, 03:35:09] Alex Regueiro: Most of the men in my family lost their hair pretty young, so I guess I knew what to expect, and it's not been worse than average üòâ
[23/01/2023, 03:35:30] Alice Lafferty: I don't know a huge amount about the biology.
[23/01/2023, 03:35:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm insecure about a few appearance things, like we all are... but not that really
[23/01/2023, 03:35:41] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting
[23/01/2023, 03:36:24] Alice Lafferty: It's definitely one of those intrasexual things, like bodybuilding physiques.
[23/01/2023, 03:36:33] Alex Regueiro: Also, speaking of resemblances, not only do I not look much like myself as a child, but even when I was 17/18! Or like my father for that matter. It's quite amazing really.
[23/01/2023, 03:37:01] Alice Lafferty: Can I see a picture of you at 18?
[23/01/2023, 03:37:04] Alex Regueiro: Though my dad as a 5 year old and me as a 5 year old do look remarkably similar.
[23/01/2023, 03:37:36] Alex Regueiro: I'll try to find it... As long as you won't think of me as that gangly, awkward, out-of-proportion version!
[23/01/2023, 03:37:37] Alice Lafferty: In my experience family resemblances have been kind of over-exaggerated.
[23/01/2023, 03:38:08] Alice Lafferty: It's fine.. I could find pictures of myself from a few years ago even with shocking haircuts.
[23/01/2023, 03:38:30] Alex Regueiro: Haha fair
[23/01/2023, 03:42:29] Alex Regueiro: Okay, found one
[23/01/2023, 03:42:33] Alex Regueiro: Not the worst actually.

[23/01/2023, 03:42:57] Alex Regueiro: At the school "prom" with friends
[23/01/2023, 03:43:01] Alex Regueiro: So had just turned 18
[23/01/2023, 03:43:37] Alice Lafferty: ... you do look really quite different. I had to sort of look briefly at all three faces before settling on which one was you!
[23/01/2023, 03:43:54] Alex Regueiro: Hint: I'm not the Chinese one!
[23/01/2023, 03:44:03] Alex Regueiro: But yeah, I was
[23/01/2023, 03:44:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes that was the first one ruled out!
[23/01/2023, 03:44:28] Alice Lafferty: No, I do see the resemblance the more I look at it.
[23/01/2023, 03:44:58] Alex Regueiro: The one on the left is still a pretty good friend. Going to his wedding in April.
[23/01/2023, 03:45:17] Alice Lafferty: I was just about to ask whether you stayed in touch with these guys...
[23/01/2023, 03:45:23] Alice Lafferty: Huh that's great
[23/01/2023, 03:46:07] Alice Lafferty: So this would have been 2008.
[23/01/2023, 03:46:15] Alex Regueiro: Not many from school. But he's one of... three? Actually two now. One of them used to be arguably my best friend, and that story is a whole can of worms...
[23/01/2023, 03:46:18] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[23/01/2023, 03:46:24] Alex Regueiro: July 2008 as I recall
[23/01/2023, 03:46:54] Alice Lafferty: üò¨ you had a falling out?
‚Äé[23/01/2023, 03:47:06] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/01/2023, 03:47:26] Alex Regueiro: Kind of. Very weird story. Can't be done justice online, certainly not at this hour heh
[23/01/2023, 03:47:56] Alex Regueiro: I presume you're still in touch with a few girls from school? Sixth form at least?
[23/01/2023, 03:48:03] Alex Regueiro: Given it's only been a few years for you
[23/01/2023, 03:48:34] Alice Lafferty: Ah, interesting, this is much closer to your current appearance. Clearly just the act of matriculating transmogrified you into your adult form.
[23/01/2023, 03:48:46] Alice Lafferty: Ok!
[23/01/2023, 03:48:54] Alex Regueiro: Haha!
[23/01/2023, 03:49:08] Alex Regueiro: Yes it's definitely closer. Somewhere between my prom pic and my current look.
[23/01/2023, 03:49:33] Alice Lafferty: Yes, one? And I don't even speak to her very regularly. I was really pretty withdrawn.
[23/01/2023, 03:50:18] Alice Lafferty: I just realised it's also the glasses, duh!
[23/01/2023, 03:50:49] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I had contacts in at the prom. Shock horror!
[23/01/2023, 03:51:13] Alice Lafferty: How come you don't use them regularly? Just a pain?
[23/01/2023, 03:51:48] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, a real pain. Unless someone tells me I look much better without glasses, I can't be arsed.
[23/01/2023, 03:52:22] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, I look forward to getting your old pics. üòÄ
[23/01/2023, 03:52:49] Alice Lafferty: I think I would have to see more images/in person to make that call. But it's possible.
[23/01/2023, 03:53:08] Alice Lafferty: Although glasses have the tendency to masculinise the face in a positive way.
[23/01/2023, 03:53:14] Alice Lafferty: So I'm not sure.
[23/01/2023, 03:53:28] Alex Regueiro: Really? I haven't heard that before. But believable
[23/01/2023, 03:53:32] Alex Regueiro: ...I suppose
[23/01/2023, 03:54:53] Alice Lafferty: Yeah if I had to guess, because of the introduction of a straight line over the brow bone.
[23/01/2023, 03:55:09] Alice Lafferty: Plus blurs asymmetry a bit.
[23/01/2023, 03:56:42] Alex Regueiro: That's true. Although for all my issues, I don't think major asymmetry is one of them luckily. Not got a lopsided face or a crooked nose at least haha
[23/01/2023, 03:57:37] Alice Lafferty: No, but everyone has minor asymmetry. Glasses probably couldn't do much for anything severe anyway.
[23/01/2023, 03:57:49] Alex Regueiro: True...
[23/01/2023, 03:58:01] Alice Lafferty: Anyway, I be off to bed now.
[23/01/2023, 03:58:08] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I just realised how late it is!
[23/01/2023, 03:58:19] Alice Lafferty: All our photo albums are in my parents' bedroom so have to wait until tomorrow.
[23/01/2023, 03:58:21] Alex Regueiro: üßõüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[23/01/2023, 03:58:48] Alex Regueiro: Sounds good.
[23/01/2023, 03:59:06] Alice Lafferty: The grey toned one looks much better..
[23/01/2023, 03:59:40] Alex Regueiro: I was just going to say... yours doesn't look half pale enough!
[23/01/2023, 03:59:57] Alex Regueiro: Good night (in my best Christopher Lee voice)

[23/01/2023, 21:17:54] Alice Lafferty: I've become obsessed with Argentina
[23/01/2023, 21:18:23] Alice Lafferty: Apparently 60% of Argentinians are full or part Italian.
[23/01/2023, 21:18:31] Alice Lafferty: Do you know if this applies to your brother in law?
‚Äé[23/01/2023, 21:57:21] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/01/2023, 21:58:27] Alex Regueiro: Haha oh really? What in particular? Anyway that's interesting... Argentina has suffered from rampant inflation for as long as I can remember...
[23/01/2023, 21:58:39] Alex Regueiro: It's brutal. The main thing my sis hates about living there
[23/01/2023, 21:59:03] Alex Regueiro: Yep I believe it. And yes, he is... his mother is mainly Italian.
[23/01/2023, 21:59:10] Alex Regueiro: Whereas his father's grandparents came from Spain I believe.
[23/01/2023, 21:59:55] Alex Regueiro: I still like it though. That's sweet how you're holding your little brother. (Alex right?)
[23/01/2023, 22:00:04] Alex Regueiro: Let's just say you were lost in deep thought!
[23/01/2023, 22:00:36] Alice Lafferty: 'There are four types of economy: developed, developing, Japan and Argentina'
‚Äé[23/01/2023, 22:00:59] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/01/2023, 22:01:15] Alice Lafferty: Yep. It was actually really fun looking through these!
[23/01/2023, 22:01:46] Alex Regueiro: I like that haha. A lot of truth in it actually.
[23/01/2023, 22:01:55] Alex Regueiro: South Korea may have a "Japan" economy these days too
[23/01/2023, 22:02:24] Alex Regueiro: That's a cute one!
[23/01/2023, 22:03:28] Alex Regueiro: So the other brother is called Finlay eh? Always thought of it as a Scottish name hmm.
[23/01/2023, 22:04:49] Alice Lafferty: It is really bizarre. Apparently they were the seventh largest economy in the world in like 1910. Then they tried Peronism, anti-Peronism, Peron‚Äôs third wife (?), nationalisation and then privatization, protectionism and then non-protectionism...
[23/01/2023, 22:05:11] Alice Lafferty: I'm really curious about how this currency will go.
[23/01/2023, 22:05:51] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, They were doing great until the 20s/30s, then everything went to pot...
[23/01/2023, 22:06:10] Alice Lafferty: It's like the euro except every country is Greece.
[23/01/2023, 22:06:18] Alex Regueiro: I'm really not sure quite why, but definitely Peronism and the general shitty populism that introduced was awful for the country's development
[23/01/2023, 22:06:33] Alex Regueiro: Hah! Pretty much. or Portugal.
[23/01/2023, 22:06:47] Alex Regueiro: I mean, Brazil is at least a somewhat big economy, but yes, I certainly know what you mean...
[23/01/2023, 22:07:18] Alice Lafferty: It seems like dissatisfaction after the great depression fuelled a coup & 50 years of political instability? I'm not sure why it was so badly hit in particular.
[23/01/2023, 22:08:15] Alice Lafferty: I've never been but obviously it's by no means a 'developing' country.
[23/01/2023, 22:08:24] Alice Lafferty: The standard of living there is quite high?
[23/01/2023, 22:13:06] Alex Regueiro: Yeah quite possibly. I wonder if it also suffered as Britain entered the war and its economy languished afterwards. Because Britain had invested quite heavily in Argentina as I understand. During the Victorian and Edwardian periods. Built up a lot of their industry and railroads.
[23/01/2023, 22:15:21] Alex Regueiro: It's a weird mixture of developed and developing really... BA (certainly the parts we hung around) makes it seem almost European level, but overall it's somewhere in-between. Terrible currency and economy aside, and laughable politics, it sometimes fools you into thinking it's developed!
[23/01/2023, 22:28:44] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, look what I saw in a newsletter... the night we're seeing the Kurosawa film!
[23/01/2023, 22:28:47] Alex Regueiro: https://www.stmartin-in-the-fields.org/whatson-event/tenebrae-rachmaninov-vespers-by-candlelight/?utm_campaign=1301711_January%20Highlights%20-%202.1.2023%20-%20Mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_source=smitf&dm_i=4UKA,RWEN,44LU6Q,3GG9H,1
[24/01/2023, 20:06:58] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting, did you go down to the Andes when you were there too?
[24/01/2023, 20:07:22] Alice Lafferty: .... :(
[24/01/2023, 20:08:19] Alice Lafferty: I could technically catch both as it finished at 8:40 and the film doesn't start until 9:00....
[24/01/2023, 22:30:32] Alex Regueiro: Nope that's a good few hundred miles west... I think Mendoza is the famous resort town out that way? My sis has been a few times.
[24/01/2023, 22:31:20] Alex Regueiro: It's so unfortunate it's then! You're right, we could just about fit it in... it's quite a rush though.
[24/01/2023, 22:31:59] Alex Regueiro: If you really fancy going, I'll join you. But might just have to accept defeat, and find some other nice concert.
[24/01/2023, 22:32:06] Alex Regueiro: (There are a few coming up anyway)
[25/01/2023, 09:04:26] Alice Lafferty: I will see how I feel tomorrow.
[25/01/2023, 09:05:39] Alice Lafferty: It's a shame as it is one of my favourite pieces of music ever, and performed by candlelight... although to be fair I wouldn't have known about it at all if you hadn't brought it to my attention.
[25/01/2023, 09:06:25] Alice Lafferty: How much do I owe you for the tickets by the way?
[25/01/2023, 15:14:49] Alex Regueiro: Heyy
[25/01/2023, 15:15:03] Alex Regueiro: Oh okay, sure. There are still tickets left it seems. üôÇ
[25/01/2023, 15:15:11] Alex Regueiro: I'd be happy to go with you, just let me know if you fancy it!
[25/01/2023, 15:15:35] Alex Regueiro: ¬£11
[25/01/2023, 23:02:26] Alice Lafferty: üòÆ‚Äçüí®
[25/01/2023, 23:08:51] Alex Regueiro: Haha, I hope that's a sigh of relief...?
[25/01/2023, 23:17:38] Alice Lafferty: I'm just kidding, but I do remember cinema tickets being like ¬£6 maybe...
[25/01/2023, 23:18:12] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I wasn't sure if that was a "fwoof, expensive!" or a relief it wasn't even worse...
[25/01/2023, 23:18:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I remember them super cheap too, of course
[25/01/2023, 23:18:42] Alice Lafferty: Interesting, they're showing Tar at the BFI tomorrow too. Have you seen it/do you intend to?
[25/01/2023, 23:19:04] Alex Regueiro: You can still occasionally get discounted ones at your local Odeon, but this is the la-di-da BFI!
[25/01/2023, 23:19:39] Alex Regueiro: Nope
[25/01/2023, 23:19:43] Alice Lafferty: It would cost ¬£0 to pirate the damn film, so I am paying ¬£11 to sit inside their brutalist block...
[25/01/2023, 23:19:44] Alex Regueiro: First I heard of it right now hah
[25/01/2023, 23:19:53] Alice Lafferty: I've actually never been, is it a nice cinema?
[25/01/2023, 23:20:05] Alex Regueiro: Nor have I in fact. Been meaning to go for years.
[25/01/2023, 23:20:09] Alice Lafferty: Does it have sofas like the Everymans do
[25/01/2023, 23:20:21] Alex Regueiro: ghastly carbuncle *
[25/01/2023, 23:20:28] Alex Regueiro: or maybe that's what he called the Barbican
[25/01/2023, 23:20:31] Alex Regueiro: much of the same
[25/01/2023, 23:20:56] Alice Lafferty: It's about a (fictional) conductor and is vaguely anti-woke I believe.
[25/01/2023, 23:21:08] Alice Lafferty: Cate Blanchett.
[25/01/2023, 23:21:09] Alex Regueiro: Ooh yes, good point. I do like the Everyman... not least for the irony of the name.
[25/01/2023, 23:21:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes...
[25/01/2023, 23:21:59] Alex Regueiro: I looked at the description and it sounded like it could be a bit woke actually... it was either going to be that or the exact opposite
[25/01/2023, 23:22:59] Alice Lafferty: Yeah or maybe even a secret third thing: morally ambiguous.
[25/01/2023, 23:23:09] Alice Lafferty: It looks quite good though I think.
[25/01/2023, 23:24:24] Alex Regueiro: I'm just reading a bit more on it
[25/01/2023, 23:24:28] Alex Regueiro: And yes it actually looks decent
[25/01/2023, 23:24:56] Alex Regueiro: Thanks for the recommendation. I'll definitely see it at some point.
[25/01/2023, 23:25:44] Alex Regueiro: Incredible. Nuance is the only thing thing rarer than conservative views in contemporary cinema!
[26/01/2023, 02:25:55] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to bed soon... just let me know by early afternoon whether you want to do the concert too. I'm happy either way, so it's down to how you feel.
[26/01/2023, 02:26:12] Alex Regueiro: Night üò¥
[26/01/2023, 09:25:06] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I will. Would have to cross the river in between the concert ending and the film beginning... it probably wouldn't be very comfortable.
[26/01/2023, 09:25:49] Alice Lafferty: https://londonconcertchoir.org/concerts/2023-03-22/rachmaninov-vespers Besides it is also being performed in London in March (not by candlelight admittedly) so perhaps I will go to that one.
[26/01/2023, 09:26:24] Alice Lafferty: What time are we meeting and where?
[26/01/2023, 15:01:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, fair enough. I mean, could take a cab... But it's all a bit of a rush eh!
[26/01/2023, 15:02:13] Alex Regueiro: Ooh, sounds good.
[26/01/2023, 15:03:19] Alex Regueiro: There are loads of candlelit concerts at St Martins anyway, so I'm sure you'll get to do that experience in due course. üôÇ
[26/01/2023, 15:04:53] Alex Regueiro: Shall we have a drink beforehand? We can meet at 8:00 at a pub nearby, or even one in the Southbank complex?
[26/01/2023, 15:07:50] Alex Regueiro: Let me know if you want something to eat then, though I'm happy just with a drink since it's late enough.
[26/01/2023, 17:22:30] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if I will be able to get there before 8:30! What do you think?
[26/01/2023, 17:39:42] Alex Regueiro: It would be nice to have a drink, but no worries! Or could have one after if you prefer?
[26/01/2023, 17:40:15] Alex Regueiro: But 8:30 is certainly fine for the film itself
[26/01/2023, 17:46:51] Alex Regueiro: It's only 1h36, just checked. So in theory very doable! But you can always see how you feel. üòä
[26/01/2023, 18:38:38] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[26/01/2023, 18:38:59] Alice Lafferty: I just realised Sanjuro is a sequel :S have you seen Yojimbo?
[26/01/2023, 18:39:17] Alice Lafferty: Probably get there closer to 8:45pm?
[26/01/2023, 18:59:51] Alex Regueiro: Yeah but it‚Äôs pretty standalone don‚Äôt worry!
[26/01/2023, 19:00:40] Alex Regueiro: Sure. I‚Äôll probably be there atiny bit earlier but that works.
[26/01/2023, 19:35:59] Alex Regueiro: Leaving now üöá
[26/01/2023, 20:44:37] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôm near the main entrance FYI. üòä
[26/01/2023, 20:50:09] Alice Lafferty: I am inside, if I am in fact in the right place! I must have walked past you
[26/01/2023, 20:50:44] Alex Regueiro: Oh hmm
[26/01/2023, 20:51:03] Alex Regueiro: BFI Southbank specifically?
[26/01/2023, 20:52:27] Alice Lafferty: I think I just heard an announcement
[26/01/2023, 20:52:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeo
[26/01/2023, 20:52:34] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[26/01/2023, 20:52:35] Alice Lafferty: For like last enrry
[26/01/2023, 20:52:37] Alice Lafferty: *entry
[26/01/2023, 20:52:54] Alex Regueiro: Okay then why can‚Äôt I see you hmm
[26/01/2023, 20:53:02] Alex Regueiro: Go up to the bar?
[27/01/2023, 00:15:43] Alice Lafferty: Did you get a train?
[27/01/2023, 00:17:37] Alex Regueiro: Really glad you enjoyed the film BTW! Thanks for coming along.
[27/01/2023, 00:17:38] Alex Regueiro: And I‚Äôm happy to recommend some other films of his like I was ssying. He has a nice habit of not losing the entertainment quality even when they‚Äôre a bit artsy. üòä
[27/01/2023, 00:17:38] Alex Regueiro: He‚Äôs done quite a variety too, even if samurai films are what he‚Äôs best known for.
[27/01/2023, 00:19:18] Alice Lafferty: Ok! I think I would like to see Yojimbo particuarly.
[27/01/2023, 00:20:39] Alex Regueiro: Yep I‚Äôm on the central line now, thanks.
[27/01/2023, 00:21:13] Alex Regueiro: That‚Äôs the one on which A Fistful of Dollars was based.
[27/01/2023, 00:23:49] Alex Regueiro: Also great
[27/01/2023, 00:32:12] Alex Regueiro: What did you think of the ‚Äúspecial effects‚Äù haha? That blood spurt‚Ä¶
[27/01/2023, 01:06:54] Alex Regueiro: Hope your journey back was smooth. Good night!
[27/01/2023, 18:36:32] Alice Lafferty: Very easy thanks, just sort of dozed in cab.
[27/01/2023, 18:37:00] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting that's a Western right?
[27/01/2023, 18:37:32] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, I was really curious about how they would do this.
[27/01/2023, 18:39:50] Alice Lafferty: Obviously they didn't really try to render actual penetration of the blades, although swords did in fact appear to be metal (not wooden like some contemporary Western historical dramas...). They seemed to throw all the gore effects at that last scene, do you think it was a budget thing or to achieve a specific effect?
[27/01/2023, 18:40:32] Alice Lafferty: I thought the lead actor was great though, and the nine guys performed the physical humour parts really well.
[27/01/2023, 18:43:53] Alex Regueiro: Yep, a famous Spaghetti Western. I really love Sergio Leone's films too, in fact. üôÇ
[27/01/2023, 18:45:00] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I thought it was actually fairly well done for the most part, even if it was sometimes obvious there was no contact. The blood pack right at the end was super obvious... kind of a delayed release and very artificial hah!
[27/01/2023, 18:45:48] Alex Regueiro: I sure hope they didn't blow the budget on that one bit of gore... given how convincing it was. Have to accept it as a film of the time (and place) though eh.
[27/01/2023, 18:47:19] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, agreed. Toshiro Mifune (the lead) is super in all the samurai films. He plays the wandering ronin perfectly. I actually can't remember him playing any other role in Kurosawa films! Talk about typecast.
[27/01/2023, 18:47:52] Alex Regueiro: üëÄ

[27/01/2023, 19:36:20] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I think I was still quite an effective scene, maybe even kind of charming.
[27/01/2023, 19:36:32] Alice Lafferty: *I mean that detail was quaint, not the scene itself...
[27/01/2023, 19:37:24] Alice Lafferty: And he always plays the same sardonic character? I think I would watch just for him. Is he also in Yojimbo?
[27/01/2023, 19:38:11] Alice Lafferty: Oh nice, weird that they are screening the prequel after the sequel. Could potentially go and see that?
[27/01/2023, 19:38:18] Alice Lafferty: How much was the drink at the pub by the way?
[27/01/2023, 19:38:54] Alice Lafferty: * pub, more like barüôÑ
[27/01/2023, 21:05:16] Alex Regueiro: Yes indeed. In terms of filmography, rather quaint.
[27/01/2023, 21:05:29] Alex Regueiro: Yes, most often. Certainly in Yojimbo, as I recall!
[27/01/2023, 21:05:59] Alex Regueiro: Though I remember basically nothing of the plot. Only that it was very good too.
[27/01/2023, 21:07:02] Alex Regueiro: It took until the end of Sanjuro for my memories of it to start coming back. The scenes with the camelias floating down the river, that bit came back to me... as it ought to really.
[27/01/2023, 21:08:25] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I was thinking that. Maybe they had another showing before the Sanjuro one though? Anyway, works for us potentially. üòÄ
[27/01/2023, 21:09:05] Alex Regueiro: Err, not sure exactly, but l'd guess around ¬£4 or a little more
[27/01/2023, 21:09:18] Alex Regueiro: Just pay me ¬£15 for the ticket plus that, and we're all square.
[27/01/2023, 21:10:53] Alex Regueiro: Did you have a good night's sleep BTW? I wanted to make a joke to you when it was the scene where Sanjuro  kept trying to sleep but kept getting interrupted by his followers bringing him news of the enemy!
[27/01/2023, 23:28:01] Alice Lafferty: That was a good scene. One thing I will say though is that it was kind of hard to pin down the tone. It was like an action comedy interspersed with solemn meditations on the nature of samurai...
[27/01/2023, 23:28:16] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[27/01/2023, 23:28:58] Alice Lafferty: Haha, I had a good mid-morning sleep for sure. Used these things
‚Äé[27/01/2023, 23:29:52] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[27/01/2023, 23:30:11] Alice Lafferty: They sort of prop your nostrils open whilst you're sleeping..
[27/01/2023, 23:33:15] Alice Lafferty: Also speaking of music composed by AI.. https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/
[27/01/2023, 23:34:08] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes, I actually thought something very similar. I'm not sure if it's just a Japanese cultural thing, a quirk Kurosawa thing, or a proper fault. Can't say I remember it being a particular feature of Kurosawa's works, though maybe my memory is just hazy agina...
[27/01/2023, 23:34:22] Alex Regueiro: I mean, at least he handled these big shifts in tone fairly well for the most part.
[27/01/2023, 23:34:34] Alex Regueiro: Excellent hah
[27/01/2023, 23:35:00] Alex Regueiro: Oh! I'm pretty sure that's the company my aunt used to work for.
[27/01/2023, 23:36:06] Alex Regueiro: As like a senior accountant
[27/01/2023, 23:36:51] Alex Regueiro: I'm pretty sure she was a fan of the products too. At least for husband! üòâ
[27/01/2023, 23:36:55] Alex Regueiro: I'll have to check with my mum.
[27/01/2023, 23:37:29] Alex Regueiro: Interesting! Let me have a listen...
[27/01/2023, 23:38:52] Alice Lafferty: I agree, not a fault.
[27/01/2023, 23:39:19] Alice Lafferty: Huh, well I think they're quite effective!
[27/01/2023, 23:39:50] Alex Regueiro: I was just going to ask... glad to hear heh
[27/01/2023, 23:40:20] Alice Lafferty: Yeah they're designed to stop snoring I think... not that I snore particularly, but recently I've been waking up with a dry mouth so I suspect it kind of hangs open when I'm asleep. A very pretty sight I'm sure.
[27/01/2023, 23:40:33] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[27/01/2023, 23:40:53] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure actually if generates new music or just chooses an already existing somg based on a prompt.
[27/01/2023, 23:41:29] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough I've been told I often sleep with my mouth open too... so maybe I should look into them. Thankfully I sleep all alone though...
[27/01/2023, 23:41:38] Alice Lafferty: It's probably much more guilty of derivativeness, even more so than the art generators.
[27/01/2023, 23:42:32] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I have an intuition good music is harder to fake... but that could just be my bias. Not sure why I think that.
[27/01/2023, 23:42:39] Alice Lafferty: It's something to look into. It leads to a degree of oxygen depletion I believe. There is a school of thought that says that nobody should be breathing through their mouths at all.
[27/01/2023, 23:42:49] Alice Lafferty: Another thing to try is taping your mouth to manually stop it from opening.
[27/01/2023, 23:42:59] Alex Regueiro: Since I don't really like country or know anything about it, that could honestly pass for real country music for me. üòê
[27/01/2023, 23:43:35] Alex Regueiro: I've heard that, but a) I don't completely buy it, b) I'm an inveterate mouthbreather anyway...
[27/01/2023, 23:43:43] Alice Lafferty: I think so. I think the number of possible arrangements of notes is just smaller than for visual art.
[27/01/2023, 23:44:00] Alex Regueiro: So I'm just going to be obstinate about it basically
[27/01/2023, 23:44:07] Alice Lafferty: I fear that I am too...
[27/01/2023, 23:45:04] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, could be that. Or it may just be that we're already very accustomed in modern society to highly derivative and poor quality imagery (through ads, more so than art... well, maybe things you see at the Tate Modern fit the bill too)
[27/01/2023, 23:48:13] Alice Lafferty: https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/19/5/859
[27/01/2023, 23:49:56] Alice Lafferty: This is about how nitric oxide is released during nasal breathing. NO is a vasodilator so oxygen inhaled nasally is more easily transported? or something.
[27/01/2023, 23:50:47] Alice Lafferty: I did feel a bit more refreshed after using the nasal strips and tape, but that could be placebo. It's obviously not possible to do a blind test.
[27/01/2023, 23:51:41] Alice Lafferty: If I had more time/money I would buy like an oxygen saturation monitor to test properly.
[27/01/2023, 23:52:03] Alice Lafferty: Haha yes true
[27/01/2023, 23:52:22] Alex Regueiro: The way I'm interpreting this paper is that mouthbreathers produce less NO therefore we're helping the environment by reducing smog!
[27/01/2023, 23:52:26] Alex Regueiro: Totally legit
[27/01/2023, 23:53:00] Alice Lafferty: Haha ok you got me
[27/01/2023, 23:54:03] Alex Regueiro: Good to know. I'll take this anecdotal evidence and certainly consider trying them... I mean, both of our sleep disorders are clearly more fundamental than how we breathe, but it can't hurt right? (Except the environment I mean.)
[27/01/2023, 23:54:41] Alex Regueiro: Would be interesting yep. I wonder if the way I breathe somehow contributes to my poor stamina. Would genuinely be curious to figure that out.
[27/01/2023, 23:55:09] Alex Regueiro: BTW did you ever look into how face masks affect inhalation/exhalation of different gases? Over the pandemic, that is.
[27/01/2023, 23:55:21] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I don't think it's going to  fix the circadian issue but it might improve the quality a bit?
[27/01/2023, 23:55:30] Alice Lafferty: Have you received the ¬£15?
[27/01/2023, 23:56:09] Alex Regueiro: I know the higher CO2 levels in the body was widely debunked as "fake news", but when it comes to the pandemic and MSM I'm always a little sceptical, since even a bit of digging reveals there was nothing like consensus among medical folks about almost anything to do with it.
[27/01/2023, 23:56:24] Alice Lafferty: Not really, no? I assume not very much - especially for the flimsy blue surgical masks which had huge gaps at the sides.
[27/01/2023, 23:56:35] Alice Lafferty: Maybe the cloth ones were a bit more restrictive.
[27/01/2023, 23:56:42] Alex Regueiro: Indeed.
[27/01/2023, 23:57:11] Alice Lafferty: I admit I didn't really look too much into it? What were the dissenting medical opinions?
[27/01/2023, 23:57:46] Alex Regueiro: Do follow through with the melatonin too BTW! Sorry if I'm nagging you, but I just really think you might benefit from it. It's not a magic pill, but it does help me. üôÇ
[27/01/2023, 23:58:03] Alex Regueiro: Got it, thanks
[27/01/2023, 23:58:23] Alex Regueiro: I didn't really look much into that. I did look more into the efficacy of masks though.
[27/01/2023, 23:58:30] Alice Lafferty: No it's fine! It's good you reminded me actually because I ought to make an appointment with my GP.
[27/01/2023, 23:58:35] Alex Regueiro: And the evidence/advice on that was extremely poorly communicated to the public.
[27/01/2023, 23:59:00] Alex Regueiro: Good! If there's even a chance you'll benefit from it, that would make me happy, really.
[28/01/2023, 00:00:00] Alice Lafferty: I thought face masks were quite good at preventing droplet transmission. Was that not the case?
[28/01/2023, 00:00:23] Alice Lafferty: I know the 2m rule stuff was on shakier ground. And the constant wiping down of surfaces!
[28/01/2023, 00:01:07] Alex Regueiro: Obviously masks depend on which type you wear, like you said. But the standard ones until typical usage habits suggest an efficacy (at blocking the virus entering the mouth) of something like 15% at best, and a deleterious effect at worse. Obviously wearing the fancy masks and being really meticulous about how you use them ought to be significantly more helpful, but hardly anyone does that, and that may have other downsides too...
[28/01/2023, 00:01:47] Alice Lafferty: Oh I didn't know this. What sort of deleterious effect?
[28/01/2023, 00:01:49] Alex Regueiro: The studies I looked at were high-level ones and meta-studies. I think that might be true, but so many things offset it that the effect is virtually cancelled out or obviated.
[28/01/2023, 00:02:26] Alex Regueiro: Like, masks can actually act as an incubator for the covid virus (and other ones) if not used/stored properly or cleaned regularly.
[28/01/2023, 00:02:27] Alice Lafferty: Is that because the public used them ineffectively? Eg the perfect case didn't exist in reality?
[28/01/2023, 00:02:32] Alex Regueiro: Some studies suggested that. Not all
[28/01/2023, 00:02:52] Alice Lafferty: Oh of course. Yes that does make sense.
[28/01/2023, 00:03:02] Alice Lafferty: Maybe the single use disposable ones were the best then?
[28/01/2023, 00:03:11] Alex Regueiro: Kind of. At least, that's the impression I got. But it's pure naivety to expect the general public (many of whom are already very reluctant) to use them like trained surgeons eh.
[28/01/2023, 00:03:28] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps. But they also looked like the flimsiest... I don't really know at the end of the day.
[28/01/2023, 00:04:00] Alex Regueiro: Just saying I was a sceptic about their efficacy. Not that I thought it was a bad idea to recommend them, just the way they were sold as panaceas (and mandated!) was pretty awful.
[28/01/2023, 00:04:42] Alex Regueiro: Haha. The generated Elvis isn't the most convincing. I think I can almost pick out bits of his actual recordings.
[28/01/2023, 00:04:53] Alice Lafferty: I know traditional media can be unreliable but it is incredible that this information could be concealed from the public I guess.
[28/01/2023, 00:05:26] Alice Lafferty: I was skeptical of lockdowns, though on a libertarian political basis, not a medical one.
[28/01/2023, 00:05:51] Alice Lafferty: Yes, probably an element of safety theatre right?
[28/01/2023, 00:06:13] Alex Regueiro: It's not like it was concealed so much as their effectiveness and the confidence about their effectiveness was completely overstated. And the lack of unanimity among medical professionals was hidden too...
[28/01/2023, 00:06:43] Alex Regueiro: I read some articles and saw a good videos by medical professionals and researchers about this. The (somewhat) dissenting ones at least.
[28/01/2023, 00:07:16] Alex Regueiro: Both for me, but yeah, mainly on the basis of liberalism, to be fair
[28/01/2023, 00:07:21] Alice Lafferty: Yeah some of the right wing news outlets covered this quite well as I remember it.
[28/01/2023, 00:07:32] Alex Regueiro: And the Frank Sinatra one hahah...
[28/01/2023, 00:07:35] Alex Regueiro: "It's Christmas time, and you know what that means,
It's hot tub time!"
[28/01/2023, 00:08:03] Alice Lafferty: I think I was interested in the epidemology at the very start but then got totally distracted by the George Floyd stuff. And stopped paying attention to the pandemic :S
[28/01/2023, 00:08:56] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Sometimes they interviewed moderated sceptic doctors though. Especially the indie web news outlets... But I won't dredge up the ones I listened to since the pandemic and lockdown are thankfully fading into oblivion now...
[28/01/2023, 00:09:03] Alice Lafferty: I still maintain that they could have done a limited lockdown for the most vulnerable populations and let it spread through the rest of the population!
[28/01/2023, 00:09:20] Alice Lafferty: I haven't listened to these. Wait I'm going to now.
[28/01/2023, 00:09:25] Alice Lafferty: ??
[28/01/2023, 00:10:09] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that was my thought from very early on. I didn't even complain about the first lockdown when they said it would be about 4 weeks... Anyway I basically have that same view now. Sweden got it 90% right for me. They just screwed up with care homes, that's more or less it.
[28/01/2023, 00:10:24] Alex Regueiro: I know. Reading that, maybe Nick Cave has a point?!
[28/01/2023, 00:12:31] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[28/01/2023, 00:13:01] Alex Regueiro: As if Sinatra would have sung that haha
[28/01/2023, 00:13:11] Alice Lafferty: I thought that it allowed you to enter your own prompts.
[28/01/2023, 00:13:19] Alex Regueiro: Oh right
[28/01/2023, 00:13:23] Alice Lafferty: They are some of the eeriest things I've ever heard.
[28/01/2023, 00:13:34] Alex Regueiro: The Katy Perry one has some weird nasty distortion as it goes on...
[28/01/2023, 00:13:46] Alex Regueiro: Yupp
[28/01/2023, 00:14:31] Alex Regueiro: Shame there's no demo feature... or rather, thank god.
[28/01/2023, 00:14:36] Alice Lafferty: Inspires exactly the same feeling as looking at AI generated images, at first glance normal, maybe just _slightly_ off, but look/listen even a little closely and it's suddenly incoherent.
[28/01/2023, 00:14:50] Alex Regueiro: Precisely
[28/01/2023, 00:15:18] Alex Regueiro: Something a bit unnerving even when you first look at / listen to it, but hard to put your finger on it.
[28/01/2023, 00:17:00] Alice Lafferty: Yep. That Sweden had an 'average' or even slightly low number of excessive deaths really drove it home for me.
[28/01/2023, 00:17:29] Alex Regueiro: Now I half want to get Nick Cave's reaction to a bit of music produced in "his style" too. A cruel curiosity, you could say...
[28/01/2023, 00:18:05] Alice Lafferty: Were those lyrics printed in the Guardian not meant to be in his style?
[28/01/2023, 00:18:06] Alice Lafferty: Maybe not
[28/01/2023, 00:18:45] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. I also admire how they were far more honest and candid with their populace. Treated them like rational adults, not the usual nanny state (on steroids) rubbish,
[28/01/2023, 00:18:50] Alex Regueiro: I thought they were? Hmm

[28/01/2023, 00:19:22] Alice Lafferty: Oh sorry yes, you mean an entire Nick Cave-style song
[28/01/2023, 00:20:12] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I'm just wondering how he'd react to to music AND lyrics generated in "his style".
[28/01/2023, 00:20:50] Alex Regueiro: Nick Cave came up on shuffle just earlier today actually. I sometimes forget how disturbing his songs can be!
[28/01/2023, 00:20:56] Alex Regueiro: This is AI generated?
[28/01/2023, 00:21:35] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of interesting because they have all the other precursors to a nanny state, eg. cradle to grave welfare.
[28/01/2023, 00:21:43] Alice Lafferty: Which song was that?
[28/01/2023, 00:21:58] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Sorry, I'm sure there are better examples.
[28/01/2023, 00:23:10] Alice Lafferty: Looks kind of normal at first but then the cabinet on the right has five legs and the window frames are actually just scribbles.

[28/01/2023, 00:23:42] Alice Lafferty: 'What a stroke victim sees'
[28/01/2023, 00:23:59] Alex Regueiro: True that. I have very mixed views about the welfare state. And they've definitely evolved over time more than my views on most things.
[28/01/2023, 00:24:09] Alex Regueiro: Where the Wild Roses Grow
[28/01/2023, 00:24:25] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I don't think I've listened to that one!
[28/01/2023, 00:24:30] Alice Lafferty: Disturbing how?
[28/01/2023, 00:24:46] Alice Lafferty: But yeah I think he was into some quite edgy stuff in like the 80s especially.
[28/01/2023, 00:25:12] Alex Regueiro: It's more convincing than the music I'd say. But still obviously overwrought, borderline mawkish.
[28/01/2023, 00:25:21] Alex Regueiro: Listen to it!
[28/01/2023, 00:25:44] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I think so. I don't know his work particularly well, but I do know he came from a punk rock background so...
[28/01/2023, 00:26:04] Alice Lafferty: Ok!
[28/01/2023, 00:26:20] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. I didn't even inspect it that closely but there you have it...
[28/01/2023, 00:26:22] Alice Lafferty: How edgy can something featuring Kylie Minogue be?üòê
[28/01/2023, 00:27:15] Alex Regueiro: Haha that's a good candidate for the first AI to get cancelled.
[28/01/2023, 00:28:56] Alex Regueiro: Hah. Well it just just seems like the usual sappy love song until the sinister aspect suddenly dawns on you.
[28/01/2023, 00:29:16] Alice Lafferty: Oh I seeüò≥ to be fair it is called Murder Ballads.
[28/01/2023, 00:29:38] Alex Regueiro: Oh is that the album?
[28/01/2023, 00:29:39] Alex Regueiro: Didn't know
[28/01/2023, 00:29:45] Alice Lafferty: That song is almost identical to Down in the Willow Garden by Boyd Rice.
[28/01/2023, 00:29:52] Alice Lafferty: I mean, the lyrics.
[28/01/2023, 00:30:04] Alice Lafferty: Including the bank and the rose etc.
[28/01/2023, 00:30:09] Alice Lafferty: Interesting
[28/01/2023, 00:30:21] Alex Regueiro: I don't know Boyd Rice, but that's interesting.
[28/01/2023, 00:30:25] Alex Regueiro: Let me listen...
[28/01/2023, 00:30:38] Alice Lafferty: No that's genuinely what that image was produced to represent.
[28/01/2023, 00:30:48] Alex Regueiro: I know but still
[28/01/2023, 00:31:08] Alice Lafferty: Ok I see how someone like Kylie Minogue is actually really effective for that.
[28/01/2023, 00:31:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah exactly. Adds to the shock value when the realisation finally arrives.
[28/01/2023, 00:31:51] Alice Lafferty: I just realised I recommended you the wrong song.
[28/01/2023, 00:32:34] Alice Lafferty: Wait no I didn't, that is the right one.
[28/01/2023, 00:32:44] Alice Lafferty: Boyd Rice is a piece of work though!
[28/01/2023, 00:36:50] Alex Regueiro: I was just going to say, the similarities are striking indeed!
[28/01/2023, 00:36:56] Alex Regueiro: Which was written first?
[28/01/2023, 00:37:00] Alex Regueiro: Could well be coincidence mind you
[28/01/2023, 00:37:06] Alex Regueiro: Given the themes
[28/01/2023, 00:37:11] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, how so?
[28/01/2023, 00:39:30] Alice Lafferty: Looks like Boyd Rice released his six years earlier.
[28/01/2023, 00:40:01] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's probably just imagery lots of people drew from.
‚Äé[28/01/2023, 00:41:32] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
‚Äé[28/01/2023, 00:41:38] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[28/01/2023, 00:41:46] Alice Lafferty: This is like his manifesto song.
[28/01/2023, 00:42:17] Alice Lafferty: 'We need a brutal gardener' was a slogan of the online right in around 2019.
[28/01/2023, 00:44:37] Alex Regueiro: Jesus
[28/01/2023, 00:44:57] Alex Regueiro: That makes Nick Cave seem like the ingenuous schoolgirl now.
[28/01/2023, 00:45:06] Alex Regueiro: Had no idea of that either
[28/01/2023, 00:45:51] Alex Regueiro: It's one thing being a bit of a misanthrope but he takes that song waay too far hah. Honestly kind of sounds like it was written by some edgy teenager just trying to provoke people.
[28/01/2023, 00:46:03] Alex Regueiro: Also, I just read he was a member of a cult... hardly surprised!
[28/01/2023, 00:46:30] Alice Lafferty: Yes, to be fair I don't know how much of it is a 'persona'
[28/01/2023, 00:46:47] Alice Lafferty: But even if it started that way, it seems he later fell in love with his costume.
[28/01/2023, 00:48:14] Alice Lafferty: People seem to forget how much neo-nazi aesthetic stuff there was on the 80s art scene, and into the early 90s. David Bowie Thin White Duke phase, Bryan Ferry was into it too I believe.
[28/01/2023, 00:49:30] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's the risk with any persona or charade. You act it long enough you start to believe it or even live it
[28/01/2023, 00:50:30] Alex Regueiro: I knew about the White Duke stuff, but not Bryan Ferry. (Bowie clearly relished upsetting people's sensibilities)
[28/01/2023, 00:52:28] Alex Regueiro: Speaking of neo-nazis and music, I never quite worked out what was going on with Charles Manson and Helter Skelter and all that.
[28/01/2023, 00:53:37] Alex Regueiro: Though I've seen some video interviews of him and it only takes about 5 minutes to realise this guy is utterly insane (and also pretty clever in his own way)
[28/01/2023, 00:54:15] Alice Lafferty: Yeah exactly some of it just provocateurism
[28/01/2023, 00:54:18] Alice Lafferty: * is that a word?
[28/01/2023, 00:54:35] Alice Lafferty: I know so so little about him, or hippies generally.
[28/01/2023, 00:55:32] Alex Regueiro: No idea, but I'll happily grant you poetic license anyway!
[28/01/2023, 00:55:52] Alex Regueiro: Language is an organic beast... and I say that as someone with decent prescriptivist tendencies.
[28/01/2023, 00:56:36] Alex Regueiro: He's definitely not a typical hippie by any count... a while ago I about the murders he was jailed for organising, but didn't go very deep down the rabbit hole
[28/01/2023, 00:56:47] Alice Lafferty: What the hell, he is repulsive but also enthralling... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k9QXY80OxS0
[28/01/2023, 00:57:46] Alice Lafferty: I really don't know.. I only know he was operative in California in the late 60s so I just assumed.
[28/01/2023, 00:58:16] Alice Lafferty: I see what you mean about being clever in his own probably.
[28/01/2023, 00:58:22] Alex Regueiro: I mean, he was certainly part of the counter-culture in a general sense, so perhaps you're not wrong to describe him as a hippie...
[28/01/2023, 00:58:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I think the murders were in California, Hollywood/LA even?
[28/01/2023, 00:59:57] Alice Lafferty: Pretty much all my knowledge comes from Once Upon A Time in Hollywood haha!
[28/01/2023, 01:03:32] Alex Regueiro: Haha fair
[28/01/2023, 01:03:36] Alex Regueiro: I haven't actually seen that
[28/01/2023, 01:03:37] Alex Regueiro: Any good?
[28/01/2023, 01:03:55] Alex Regueiro: Cinema does love it's "Once upon a time" films
[28/01/2023, 01:05:05] Alex Regueiro: Sergi Leone did too (Once upon a time in America and Once upon a time in the West). The latter is one of my favourites, possibly the best Western ever made.
[28/01/2023, 20:12:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes I believe Tarantino is a huge fan of spaghetti westerns... Leonardo DiCaprio acts in one in the movie.
[28/01/2023, 20:12:18] Alice Lafferty: It was ok!
[28/01/2023, 20:13:17] Alice Lafferty: A bit overlong. Generally nowhere near as violent as usual.
[28/01/2023, 20:13:47] Alice Lafferty: I think I liked True Romance the best.
[28/01/2023, 20:15:00] Alice Lafferty: Speaking of which... you can add the only tolerable love quote to the salon prescribed reading list ;)
‚Äé[28/01/2023, 20:15:12] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[28/01/2023, 21:30:48] Alex Regueiro: Yep I think so. Tarantino is a weird one for me... pretty hit and miss. Not really a fan of his ultra violence, but there's still a certain art to his film making. I like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, even though they're pretty brutal, the latter in particular.
[28/01/2023, 21:30:56] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's what I heard
[28/01/2023, 21:31:50] Alex Regueiro: Don't think I've seen that in absolutely ages. I should rewatch it really
[28/01/2023, 21:32:13] Alex Regueiro: Anyway Leone's style was very different, even if it inspired Tarantino in some ways. It's not about violence/gore at all.
[28/01/2023, 21:33:13] Alex Regueiro: Haha very good. I vaguely recall seeing it before. If you unpack what's behind the words, I'd say there's probably a good bit of truth there.
[28/01/2023, 21:33:16] Alex Regueiro: Are you a fan of Murdoch?
[28/01/2023, 21:36:25] Alex Regueiro: We can count it more as a crime film though, so you don't have to say you like a romance film. üòâ (But do you have one you really like?)
[28/01/2023, 21:36:44] Alex Regueiro: My sister used to love The Notebook as a teenager. ü§¢
[28/01/2023, 21:49:39] Alice Lafferty: Same here
[28/01/2023, 21:50:06] Alice Lafferty: I really liked Inglorious Bastards too.
[28/01/2023, 21:51:09] Alice Lafferty: I think I've only ever seen The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly which was kind of epic actually
[28/01/2023, 21:52:38] Alice Lafferty: Plus they had the great Ennio Morricone scores.
[28/01/2023, 21:53:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes, probably my favourite (?) or second favourite writer of fiction.
[28/01/2023, 21:53:52] Alice Lafferty: No! I've never really seen a romance film that didn't overdo it. I would like to see a really austere, restrained one.
[28/01/2023, 21:54:08] Alice Lafferty: Ok, not quite true. I though the end of The Remains of the Day was moving.
[28/01/2023, 21:54:12] Alice Lafferty: Have you?
[28/01/2023, 21:54:47] Alice Lafferty: No offence to her but that one was criminally bad.
[28/01/2023, 21:57:14] Alex Regueiro: I haven't actually seen more than snippets but yeah, it really seems like all the worst clich√©s and saccharine bullshit you get in romance films packed into one unholy product.
[28/01/2023, 21:57:23] Alex Regueiro: Thankfully she outgrew it at least...
[28/01/2023, 21:58:37] Alex Regueiro: I've not read her, alas... but yeah, her works do seem appealing.
[28/01/2023, 21:58:51] Alex Regueiro: (Who else would be favourite, if not her?)
[28/01/2023, 21:59:22] Alex Regueiro: Like with most films I haven't seen recently, can't remember the plot, but do remember very much admiring it!
[28/01/2023, 21:59:53] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I was fortunate enough to see him live in concert a couple of years before he died. Got a lot of his stuff in my library.
[28/01/2023, 22:00:16] Alice Lafferty: üòÆüòÆüòÆ
[28/01/2023, 22:00:18] Alex Regueiro: Very good film. Not his best, but very good. I can even admire the Kill Bills, though they're not exactly my cup of tea.
[28/01/2023, 22:00:43] Alex Regueiro: Marvellous film, though of the trilogy my favourite is actually For A Few Dollars more.
[28/01/2023, 22:00:47] Alice Lafferty: Even has a horribly cynical dementia """tear-jerker""". Really bottom-barrel.
[28/01/2023, 22:00:58] Alex Regueiro: Oh dear
[28/01/2023, 22:01:11] Alice Lafferty: Don't get me wrong - it's just schlock with a highbrow veneer.
[28/01/2023, 22:01:26] Alice Lafferty: That would be Thomas Hardy probably. What about you?
[28/01/2023, 22:01:27] Alex Regueiro: I don't mean to be mean, but my sis was a very naive and idealistic in her (early) teens. Like the vast majority of teens, I suppose?
[28/01/2023, 22:01:53] Alice Lafferty: Haha just absorb the vibes
[28/01/2023, 22:01:55] Alex Regueiro: Ah, the perennial favourite of University Challenge! I know the names of his main works for that reason. And nothing more.
[28/01/2023, 22:02:48] Alice Lafferty: You mean he was conducting?
[28/01/2023, 22:03:08] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, conducting his orchestra that he tours around with
[28/01/2023, 22:03:13] Alex Regueiro: Spoke a little too
[28/01/2023, 22:03:40] Alice Lafferty: Ha, he was really good at titles I think. It's kind of English sentimentalism... but it's good.
[28/01/2023, 22:05:03] Alice Lafferty: No of course, I was too. I didn't mean to sound _too_ unbearably snobby. I still indulge in like weepy music sometimes.
[28/01/2023, 22:05:41] Alice Lafferty: Do you remember what they played?
[28/01/2023, 22:05:44] Alex Regueiro: That's about the extent of my sentimental indulgence too. Since I'm a bit of a philistine when it comes to poetry, as you know...
[28/01/2023, 22:05:59] Alice Lafferty: Also, would you mind sending me the School of Life article that you mentioned?
[28/01/2023, 22:06:10] Alex Regueiro: Yep, could well be!
[28/01/2023, 22:06:36] Alice Lafferty: Haha, not really! 99% of it is not worth reading anyway
[28/01/2023, 22:06:44] Alex Regueiro: Err, I meant to say, that sounds very believable given the extremely little I know of him
[28/01/2023, 22:07:19] Alex Regueiro: Huge range. Not all my favourite pieces of his, but... too many to list! Almost all of the super famous ones, and a smattering of less famous ones too.
[28/01/2023, 22:07:47] Alex Regueiro: Sure. Will be curious what you think.
[28/01/2023, 22:07:48] Alex Regueiro: https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/how-romanticism-ruined-love/
[28/01/2023, 22:08:03] Alex Regueiro: It's syndicated elsewhere under Alain de Botton's name, so it's definitely by him.
[28/01/2023, 22:08:14] Alice Lafferty: Thanksüëç
[28/01/2023, 22:08:54] Alex Regueiro: And you probably remember, but just to be sure, it's 7pm Wednesday at The Angel pub near TCR Station.
[28/01/2023, 22:09:23] Alex Regueiro: It usually doesn't officially begin until 8 though. People just filter in and have a chat and a drink.
[28/01/2023, 22:10:48] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. I really didn't read a lot of "classic" or high-brow literature in my youth. I was a huge Tolkien fan, as you know. And a few sci-fi authors too (Clarke, Asimov, Herbert mainly).
[28/01/2023, 22:14:02] Alice Lafferty: This is very interesting as it is almost precisely the argument I made - that the vast majority of marriages that ever took place were never in any sense 'love marriages'.
[28/01/2023, 22:14:20] Alice Lafferty: *A few weeks ago I mean
[28/01/2023, 22:15:10] Alex Regueiro: Had a think now, and I did really like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The Secret in Their Eyes too (Argentine film)
[28/01/2023, 22:15:21] Alice Lafferty: I don't think it sufficiently went into _why_ Big Romance was bad.
[28/01/2023, 22:15:24] Alex Regueiro: Both are really a mixture of genres, but I think it's fair to call them romances
[28/01/2023, 22:15:29] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and I did enjoy Am√©lie.
[28/01/2023, 22:15:33] Alice Lafferty: But I'm already inclined to agree so
[28/01/2023, 22:15:52] Alex Regueiro: "Big Romance". Hah.
[28/01/2023, 22:16:12] Alice Lafferty: I'm afraid I haven't seen the latter, but I thought ESOTSM was... well, a bit overhyped maybe. It's interesting that you enjoyed it.
[28/01/2023, 22:16:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it stays pretty surface level... myself I very much agree and disagree with it at the same time, I'd say
[28/01/2023, 22:16:42] Alex Regueiro: I last saw it... probably in my teens? Did enjoy it very much back then in any case.
[28/01/2023, 22:16:46] Alice Lafferty: I thought this was a bit twee sorry!!
[28/01/2023, 22:17:02] Alex Regueiro: It was
[28/01/2023, 22:17:12] Alex Regueiro: Maybe I tolerated the tweeness because it was French
[28/01/2023, 22:17:14] Alex Regueiro: !
[28/01/2023, 22:17:23] Alice Lafferty: I shouldn't be mean about people's favourite films though. It doesn't really further anyone's understanding or appreciation, it probably just makes people defensive.
[28/01/2023, 22:17:36] Alice Lafferty: Whixh parts do you disagree with?
[28/01/2023, 22:17:40] Alex Regueiro: These aren't my favourite. I do think they're very good films though.
[28/01/2023, 22:17:46] Alex Regueiro: Certainly among the best romance ones.
[28/01/2023, 22:18:11] Alex Regueiro: Also, this is me 10, 15, even 20 years ago giving his opinion, kind of!
[28/01/2023, 22:18:27] Alice Lafferty: I thought the premise was good, but do you remember this scene where Jim Carey gets like miniaturised in his childhood home? Maybe a dream sequence?
[28/01/2023, 22:18:55] Alex Regueiro: It can often do yes. Like with anything people hold close to heart, even abstract things. But I'm happy to hear what you think here!
[28/01/2023, 22:19:03] Alice Lafferty: Maybe this was before you'd really been in a relationship before and it's changed since? Might be interesting to rewatch
[28/01/2023, 22:19:34] Alex Regueiro: Afraid not. I'm terrible remembering plots like I said, and that one's definitely been at least 15 years since I watched it!
[28/01/2023, 22:19:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah might well be
[28/01/2023, 22:19:58] Alice Lafferty: Have you seen any of Kaufman's other films? Synecdoche  New York?
[28/01/2023, 22:19:58] Alex Regueiro: I've drastically changed my opinions on a few films I've rewatched years later... but only a handful
[28/01/2023, 22:20:26] Alice Lafferty: That seen disturbed me so much that it negatively coloured the rest of the film I think...
[28/01/2023, 22:20:33] Alex Regueiro: I haven't seen that no. I remember when it came out. Any good?
[28/01/2023, 22:20:40] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair
[28/01/2023, 22:21:31] Alice Lafferty: Imo he attempts interesting themes that he can't really deliver on.
[28/01/2023, 22:21:41] Alice Lafferty: I also dislike them aesthetically.
[28/01/2023, 22:24:10] Alex Regueiro: I see
[28/01/2023, 22:24:43] Alex Regueiro: I wasn't a huge fan of Being John Malkovich, to say the least
[28/01/2023, 22:24:51] Alex Regueiro: probably half because I don't really care for him as an actor
[28/01/2023, 22:25:54] Alex Regueiro: or Adaptation
[28/01/2023, 22:26:23] Alex Regueiro: I do think he largely pulled of Eternal Sushine, thought that is an old version of me speaking, and I've had a few hardware and software updates since.
[28/01/2023, 22:28:31] Alex Regueiro: Re the article... I'd like to make the mundane claim that the middle way is probably the most fruitful. You need a bit of genuine passion and all the irrationality and tinted spectacles that come with it at the start of a relationship, but that can't sustain you forever. Or even medium-term. It shouldn't sustain you. That should be replaced by something more akin to a deep friendship or companionship. And practical considerations become more and more important as a relationship progresses.
[28/01/2023, 22:28:53] Alice Lafferty: Haven't seen this one.
[28/01/2023, 22:29:10] Alice Lafferty: I usually love Nic Cage...
[28/01/2023, 22:29:24] Alex Regueiro: I'm really not coming from a place of great experience and wisdom here, as you know, but this is what seems right and balanced to me from the experience I have had...
[28/01/2023, 22:29:38] Alice Lafferty: Interesting. Yeah if you ever get the chance you should rewatch it.
[28/01/2023, 22:30:30] Alex Regueiro: Relationships seem to wither and decay for different reasons if they're dominated too much by either dreamy romantic ideals or conversely when they're too pragmatic and prosaic.
[28/01/2023, 22:30:32] Alice Lafferty: Ok. This does make sense.
[28/01/2023, 22:30:40] Alex Regueiro: Quickly, at that!
[28/01/2023, 22:30:48] Alex Regueiro: I will. When did you last see it?
[28/01/2023, 22:31:26] Alex Regueiro: I downloaded Ikiru to watch at home, by the way. I can enjoy a bit of existential dread in the wee hours of the morning, just when I need it!
[28/01/2023, 22:31:46] Alice Lafferty: I suppose my only concern is that a) this still endorses selecting partners on the basis of attraction more so than actual compatibility and b) issue arises where a few people are highly attractive to a high number of people and some are not at all - so is problematic if you want to retain monogamous features.
[28/01/2023, 22:32:03] Alex Regueiro: I kind of like him too. Frankly he's been in some brilliant and terrible films alike. It's never just a so-so film, it seems.
[28/01/2023, 22:32:42] Alice Lafferty: This is all hearsay of course, but apparently some arranged marriages grow to be quite intimate and satisfying over time.
[28/01/2023, 22:33:02] Alex Regueiro: But it's crucial to admit our human nature ‚Äì that we're hardwired to account for physical and emotional attraction, and even a 'spark' or 'chemistry'. Best not to deny our nature, only temper it. And yes, this "nature" does vary considerably between people, but we all have an element of it.
[28/01/2023, 22:33:03] Alice Lafferty: Ofc notably don't hear about the ones that just end in acrimony or actual pviolence.
[28/01/2023, 22:33:31] Alice Lafferty: Oh really! What service did you use?
[28/01/2023, 22:33:41] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I've heard similar things though. The divorce rate being very low for arranged marriages is probably a combination of cultural factors (like stigma or plain impossibility of divorce in certain cases) and more realistic expectations and mature attitudes.
[28/01/2023, 22:33:45] Alice Lafferty: Do you have a BFI subscription?
[28/01/2023, 22:34:08] Alex Regueiro: No. I've downloaded one or two films on BFI before... probably should have this time too.
[28/01/2023, 22:34:14] Alex Regueiro: But I'm a naughty boy, I torrented it.
[28/01/2023, 22:34:37] Alice Lafferty: Lots of societies do - not so much temper as totally quash it though.
[28/01/2023, 22:34:39] Alex Regueiro: I figure he's long dead at least, and already got plenty of money out of his films, among other things!
[28/01/2023, 22:34:42] Alice Lafferty: And they do so quite effectively.
[28/01/2023, 22:35:20] Alex Regueiro: I'm not convinced that's the case, except for a minute fraction of upper-class purely political/practical marriage arrangements.
[28/01/2023, 22:35:39] Alice Lafferty: I always wonder about the rate of extramarital affairs in highly sex segregated societies. It must be fairly small.
[28/01/2023, 22:35:59] Alice Lafferty: I'm talking Islamic and Hindu cultures.
[28/01/2023, 22:36:22] Alex Regueiro: Again, the feelings of the bride and groom (especially the groom) are not totally ignored by any means.
[28/01/2023, 22:36:48] Alex Regueiro: I've talked with people who have first-hand and second-hand experience with Hindu marriage, and read a fair bit too in the past.
[28/01/2023, 22:36:59] Alice Lafferty: Yes I agree. It's like that statistic that gets cynically wheeled out by US rightists - that people who don't cohabit before marriage are less likely to divorce. Well, yeah, because only fundies do that!
[28/01/2023, 22:36:59] Alex Regueiro: Probably yes
[28/01/2023, 22:37:23] Alice Lafferty: Really? They had arranged marriages?
[28/01/2023, 22:37:32] Alice Lafferty: I imagine it's liberalised a lot though in the last century.
[28/01/2023, 22:37:47] Alex Regueiro: Yeah.
[28/01/2023, 22:37:57] Alex Regueiro: Often parents of British Asian friends I've had
[28/01/2023, 22:38:06] Alice Lafferty: He's turning in his grave...
[28/01/2023, 22:38:07] Alex Regueiro: So, it's more second-hand knowledge really, but a little first-hand...
[28/01/2023, 22:38:19] Alex Regueiro: He was probably cremated üòâ
[28/01/2023, 22:39:17] Alice Lafferty: Did they speak about it in a largely positive or negative way?
[28/01/2023, 22:39:24] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, on the subject of films and Ishiguro, Never Let Me Go is a decent 'romance'. Even if it does have Keira Knightley in irt.
[28/01/2023, 22:39:56] Alice Lafferty: Ah, I've read the novel but haven't seen the film! I do love him too.
[28/01/2023, 22:40:08] Alice Lafferty: Not a Keira Knightley fan?üßê
[28/01/2023, 22:40:12] Alex Regueiro: I mean, my overall impression (only that remains) was that they were genuinely happy and satisfied. I can't know what it was like behind close doors, but still. I've also heard one or two bad cases to be fair
[28/01/2023, 22:40:37] Alex Regueiro: Not particularly. Nothing to do with looks really. I can tell you one or two stories about her actually. Second-hand knowledge!
[28/01/2023, 22:41:54] Alice Lafferty: Interesting. The only other upside I can see is that relieves burden of competition to a certain extent by shifting it to the parents.
[28/01/2023, 22:42:06] Alex Regueiro: Part of me just loves the idea of a Japanese guy being a complete Anglophile in his writing.
[28/01/2023, 22:42:06] Alice Lafferty: Although it's obviously a huge reduction in agency too.
[28/01/2023, 22:42:36] Alice Lafferty: I think she should have been a model instead of an actress.
[28/01/2023, 22:42:57] Alice Lafferty: ? Is she difficult to work with or something?
[28/01/2023, 22:43:02] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Just don't get the wrong impression: it was almost never, in any society/culture/class, entirely one-sided, in terms of practicality vs romance or the parents' choice vs the partners' choices.
[28/01/2023, 22:43:10] Alice Lafferty: I know, it's curious isn't it.
[28/01/2023, 22:43:14] Alex Regueiro: With a very few exceptions
[28/01/2023, 22:43:16] Alex Regueiro: Yep!
[28/01/2023, 22:43:24] Alex Regueiro: Yep that's definitely been said
[28/01/2023, 22:43:26] Alex Regueiro: A real prima donna
[28/01/2023, 22:44:04] Alice Lafferty: And he's actually really insightful. Maybe the Japanese just don't have an equivalent to the sort of reductive Orientalism that we have in the west.
[28/01/2023, 22:44:51] Alice Lafferty: Maybe... I could stand to do more research on this to be fair.
[28/01/2023, 22:44:52] Alex Regueiro: Yes. I think partly it helps that he IS an outsider in some sense, which sharpens one's awareness of a culture in some ways, I would say. And partly he was actually mostly raised in Britain I think?
[28/01/2023, 22:45:22] Alex Regueiro: We've definitely had a very similar conversation before anyway. Two or three months ago. So at this point we'd probably just converge towards things we've already said heh
[28/01/2023, 22:45:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes I mean I think he writes in English. He is often confused with Marukami, who writes in Japanese.
[28/01/2023, 22:46:10] Alex Regueiro: Ah, I don't know Marukami
[28/01/2023, 22:46:53] Alice Lafferty: Ha yes. All the data seems corrupted, incomplete or just useless though. Like what good is self-reported marital satisfaction in a society with a taboo against divorce?
[28/01/2023, 22:47:08] Alice Lafferty: What percentage of domestic violence cases were hushed up?
[28/01/2023, 22:47:22] Alex Regueiro: To be clear, a young coworker (good acquaintance, perhaps even friend you could say) of my dad dated her for a few years. So I got some stories. üòâ
[28/01/2023, 22:47:36] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, indeed
[28/01/2023, 22:47:41] Alex Regueiro: So hard to do proper sociology on this
[28/01/2023, 22:47:47] Alice Lafferty: Subjective happiness seems like another black box.
[28/01/2023, 22:48:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see... is he super handsome?
[28/01/2023, 22:48:59] Alice Lafferty: Although they often get criticised, I do understand why people like to optimise for other social factors less nebulous than 'welbeing'.
[28/01/2023, 22:50:05] Alex Regueiro: Hard for me to say, but he's a typical public school English playboy. Somewhat posh, ex rugby player, polo player type.
[28/01/2023, 22:50:27] Alice Lafferty: I see, I see
[28/01/2023, 22:50:27] Alex Regueiro: Nice enough guy though. Don't want to deprecate him too much!
[28/01/2023, 22:50:42] Alex Regueiro: I'll tell you the stories in person if you like...
[28/01/2023, 22:51:00] Alice Lafferty: Ha ok!
[28/01/2023, 22:51:00] Alex Regueiro: Ugh. Wellbeing is an intensely irritating word to me, for some reason.
[28/01/2023, 22:51:16] Alice Lafferty: Probably because it's so imprecise?
[28/01/2023, 22:51:23] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps because it attempts to abstract, rationalise, scientificise (not a word, I know) the human experience
[28/01/2023, 22:51:38] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes. I know what you mean.
[28/01/2023, 22:51:39] Alex Regueiro: Just like the "pursuit of happiness" sort of annoys me.
[28/01/2023, 22:52:19] Alex Regueiro: I'm convinced happiness is nothing more than a pleasant byproduct of a good life. But not will/should a good life be entirely comprised of happiness anyway. Just good doses.
[28/01/2023, 22:52:36] Alice Lafferty: Kind of like those articles that say 'laughing is good for you because it lowers your blood pressure'
[28/01/2023, 22:52:57] Alice Lafferty: I hate to say this to you but Heidegger wrote extensively about this phenomenon...
[28/01/2023, 22:52:59] Alex Regueiro: And the fact that there exist "wellbeing experts" and life coaches... these people are guaranteed to know bugger all about real happiness, I'd say!
[28/01/2023, 22:53:09] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah?
[28/01/2023, 22:54:24] Alice Lafferty: Heidegger describes this way of objectifying people into 'standing-reserve'...
[28/01/2023, 22:54:32] Alice Lafferty: I'll try and find a good paper on it.
[28/01/2023, 22:55:27] Alice Lafferty: I don't know what 'happiness' is supposed to be, separable from hormonally-influenced mood states.
[28/01/2023, 22:55:36] Alex Regueiro: Thanks. Sounds interesting.
[28/01/2023, 22:55:45] Alice Lafferty: I'm probably guilty of the 'scientification' that you referred to myself...
[28/01/2023, 22:57:13] Alice Lafferty: I agree. I think there's been an attempt to draw out sort of baseline 'contentment' from actively experiencing joy or pleasure, which is probably a step in the right direction.
[28/01/2023, 22:58:10] Alex Regueiro: Yes, you may well be... so have I in the past. Though I try to separate the phenomenal/experiential and scientific/natural ways of looking at the world these days, and I think it really helps. Not that they can't inform each other (mainly the latter informing the former, but also the reverse, as a good neo-Kantian!)
[28/01/2023, 22:59:36] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. With my scientific hat on: it's just a biological signal that you're fulfilling some evo-psych goals, at least at a crude superficial level, right?
[28/01/2023, 22:59:51] Alex Regueiro: You would have enjoyed the salon we did on scientism last summer...
‚Äé[28/01/2023, 23:00:57] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
‚Äé[28/01/2023, 23:01:02] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[28/01/2023, 23:01:19] Alice Lafferty: From this actually very interesting paper: https://jogts.org/index.php/jogts/article/download/11/4
[28/01/2023, 23:02:46] Alice Lafferty: I don't feel I can reasonably separate the two without betraying my comittment to physicalism/non-dualism though...
[28/01/2023, 23:04:04] Alice Lafferty: That's my sort of knee-jerk explanation yes.
[28/01/2023, 23:04:20] Alice Lafferty: I realise it's reductive but isn't simplicity what we aim for?
[28/01/2023, 23:04:48] Alice Lafferty: Don't feel obliged to read these by the way! They're obviously very wordy
[28/01/2023, 23:04:57] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I feel I can do that. Though there are definitely some subtleties involved. We'll have a proper discussion about this at some point, for sure. (Once I've gathered my thoughts about it more, ideally!)
[28/01/2023, 23:06:07] Alice Lafferty: Good, you can let me know if you find a way out of that particular tangle
[28/01/2023, 23:06:17] Alice Lafferty: I haven't been able to so far
[28/01/2023, 23:07:53] Alex Regueiro: That paragraph starts of quite neo-Kantian and ends up almost postmodern. I actually have a lot of sympathy with that point, even though I don't quite get the term "standing-reserve" (probably works better in German).
[28/01/2023, 23:08:44] Alice Lafferty: Yes treating people as means rather than ends.
[28/01/2023, 23:08:56] Alex Regueiro: Right. And that's part of our very human (or even generally animalistic) way of making sense of the world. There's nothing 'wrong' with it as long as we can appreciate that it exists.
[28/01/2023, 23:09:07] Alex Regueiro: In the general sense at least
[28/01/2023, 23:09:25] Alex Regueiro: The creation of ontologies, and treating objects, the environment, or even people as "resources" and "tools".
[28/01/2023, 23:09:37] Alex Regueiro: Awareness of how our minds operate is the most important thing here.
[28/01/2023, 23:09:43] Alice Lafferty: Ofc 'bestand' needs 25 pages of gobbledegook to expound its meaningüôÑ
[28/01/2023, 23:09:47] Alex Regueiro: So I won't get so down about it as Heidegger seems to get.
[28/01/2023, 23:10:10] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. That's continental philosophy for you.
[28/01/2023, 23:10:21] Alex Regueiro: ...yes, my prejudices are coming out again here.
[28/01/2023, 23:10:41] Alex Regueiro: "Continental" philosophy mainly went downhill after Kant, from what I can tell.
[28/01/2023, 23:10:48] Alex Regueiro: Even with him, in some ways
[28/01/2023, 23:11:23] Alice Lafferty: I agree. I literally just realised yesterday that philosophy of mind and epistemology are the same thing.
[28/01/2023, 23:11:49] Alice Lafferty: I agree that this is bad in some sense - but again I disagree that it's uniquely modern.
[28/01/2023, 23:12:13] Alice Lafferty: It's fine, they're usually justified.
[28/01/2023, 23:14:00] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes, at some level they are. I mean, the way philosophers approach them is quite different, but they're fundamentally joined at the hip.
[28/01/2023, 23:14:32] Alice Lafferty: Almost all postmodernists are  necessarily neo-Kantians I guess
[28/01/2023, 23:14:44] Alex Regueiro: It's not (and I'm not arguing that). Arguably it's seen its worst expression take form in late/liquid capitalism, but it's been around in some sense since prehistory. Inbuilt to our human psychology.
[28/01/2023, 23:14:57] Alex Regueiro: Haven't considered this explicitly, but you're probably right
[28/01/2023, 23:15:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly. But it gets mysteriously ascribed to 'modernity' (for rightists) and 'capitalism' (for leftists).
[28/01/2023, 23:16:30] Alice Lafferty: Like: "It started to rain today and I forgot my umbrella...[indistinct]... O the trials of life under capitalism."
[28/01/2023, 23:16:58] Alex Regueiro: Yes haha.
[28/01/2023, 23:17:36] Alex Regueiro: And despite being a rightist I'm ascribing it to capitalism haha. Have I been brainwashed somewhere along the line? Hmm
[28/01/2023, 23:17:39] Alice Lafferty: We could RETVRN to naive realism/phenomenological conservatism.
[28/01/2023, 23:17:50] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps liberalism-capitalism as a unified ideology?
[28/01/2023, 23:17:58] Alice Lafferty: It's fine, you clearly have absorbed elements from left and right
[28/01/2023, 23:18:02] Alex Regueiro: I have yes
[28/01/2023, 23:18:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes - but aren't people commodified under feudalism too.
[28/01/2023, 23:18:37] Alex Regueiro: I hate naive realism, even if I do operate by it in everyday life for all intents and purposes. It's just not a proper philosophy. It doesn't clarify anything, it just brushes it all under the rug.
[28/01/2023, 23:19:07] Alex Regueiro: Yep... I'd just argue we commodify more types and things and more extensively under contemporary liberal-capitalism... but I need to think about this more perhaps
[28/01/2023, 23:19:26] Alice Lafferty: But that's the very thing. If it's 'obviously wrong', why does it work so wellü§î
[28/01/2023, 23:19:41] Alice Lafferty: Doesn't your pragmatism dictate to a certain extent you should just believe what's before your eyes?
[28/01/2023, 23:20:24] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, even Marxism does not escape this charge. It may just be a feature of all large-scale human organisations.
[28/01/2023, 23:21:54] Alice Lafferty: I agree it's unsatisfying. I think a form of indirect realism may very well prove to be correct.
[28/01/2023, 23:21:57] Alice Lafferty: *though
[28/01/2023, 23:23:02] Alex Regueiro: Yes, if the context of the pragmatism is "everyday life". But it's not always that. It could be natural science, existential questions, sociology, politics, etc. etc.
[28/01/2023, 23:23:45] Alex Regueiro: It doesn't. I'd say it's a feature of the human psyche full stop, just it becomes more apparent (nefarious even) at a large scale and in modern societies.
[28/01/2023, 23:23:54] Alex Regueiro: Well, you know my thoughts on this!
[28/01/2023, 23:24:00] Alice Lafferty: I meant to say I think, that our mental model of the world must be _quite_ good, as we're able to navigate it so well .
[28/01/2023, 23:24:28] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it depends how you interpret "indirect realism" (which is very general and vague if you want it to be), but arguably I am one. Kant certainly was.
[28/01/2023, 23:24:35] Alice Lafferty: Reason for pessimism?
[28/01/2023, 23:24:36] Alex Regueiro: Right. That's certainly a pragmatist angle.
[28/01/2023, 23:24:54] Alex Regueiro: Not necessarily... though it's something we should definitely be cautious about it getting out of hand.
[28/01/2023, 23:26:25] Alice Lafferty: Yeah naive realism is unsupportable just because of what we know about eg. the electromagnetic spectrum. Pinning down the degree of 'indirectness' is the issue.
[28/01/2023, 23:26:46] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I do spend a lot of time thinking about this and yet I never seem to be able to add anything new...ü§î
[28/01/2023, 23:27:17] Alice Lafferty: I do tend to just retreat back into deflationary physicalism.
[28/01/2023, 23:27:49] Alex Regueiro: Right. And even everyday abstract notions create big problems for it. (Like numbers, for one.)
[28/01/2023, 23:28:17] Alex Regueiro: Haha it's only natural (pun not intended in this case)... but at least you're questioning how far it can get you.
[28/01/2023, 23:28:22] Alex Regueiro: I used to be entirely the same way, I'd say
[28/01/2023, 23:29:44] Alice Lafferty: I do see how if you think about this long enough the mind does seem to have fundamentally different properties from everything else.
[28/01/2023, 23:30:49] Alice Lafferty: I sort of understand the origin of monism/pluralism issues.
[28/01/2023, 23:33:30] Alex Regueiro: It is quite a distinct category after all. I suppose I don't even know what it would mean to "reconcile" phenomenology and natural science (or indeed physicalism), so I tend not to treat it as a good/useful question to ask. Which is reflected in my attitude towards the hard problem of consciousness.
[28/01/2023, 23:34:07] Alex Regueiro: No doubt, but also, calling philosophical views "monistic" or "dualistic" or "pluralistic" is terribly facile in some cases. An unfortunate leftover from ancient and medieval philosophy, I feel.
[28/01/2023, 23:34:20] Alex Regueiro: It sometimes adds something to the discussion, but very often not
[28/01/2023, 23:35:34] Alice Lafferty: I know you think it's a category error... I suppose it still remains a pressing issue to me that the mind can generate new events that don't appear to have direct physical causes.
[28/01/2023, 23:36:04] Alice Lafferty: I think it comes from taking seriously the idea that consciousness might be completely different in substance to matter.
[28/01/2023, 23:36:28] Alice Lafferty: Which obviously sounds really ancient and spooky yeah..
[28/01/2023, 23:38:09] Alex Regueiro: Can you make this more concrete?
[28/01/2023, 23:39:01] Alex Regueiro: I mean, I have some sympathy for this in the most liberal interpretation of "substance". But I think that's a problematic term because its inherently materialist.
[28/01/2023, 23:39:25] Alex Regueiro: Which is why I prefer to frame them as two different categories or perhaps 'modes' of treating the world, the totality of experience.
[28/01/2023, 23:40:01] Alice Lafferty: I mean, this is what Kant thought - that the mind essentially conjures 'mental models' from sensory input. What is the nature of that conjuring trick.
[28/01/2023, 23:40:22] Alice Lafferty: I mean - sensory experience does not inhere in the material world.
[28/01/2023, 23:41:51] Alex Regueiro: On the contrary, he thought that we impose our mental structures on sensory experience. We don't extrapolate and generalise from sensory experience, like the logical positivists though.
[28/01/2023, 23:41:56] Alex Regueiro: That is true
[28/01/2023, 23:42:04] Alice Lafferty: Material world -> sensory input -> illusion -> material output. Isn't that kind of odd?
[28/01/2023, 23:42:33] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I though to a certain extent they must influence each other reciprocally?
[28/01/2023, 23:43:15] Alice Lafferty: So the world just conforms or appears to conform to our mental model?
[28/01/2023, 23:44:01] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, though Kant's key insight is that was the "dualism" of the noumenon and phenomenon, and that we can only ever experience phenomenon, as mediated through our minds.
[28/01/2023, 23:44:10] Alice Lafferty: I haven't read the critique of pure reason I admit.. so this is all second hand stuff.
[28/01/2023, 23:44:10] Alex Regueiro: Pretty much yeah
[28/01/2023, 23:44:41] Alex Regueiro: Nor have I. And I'm not inclined to any time soon... Kant is abominably difficult to read, either in English translations or the original German, I'm told! Notoriously so.
[28/01/2023, 23:45:09] Alex Regueiro: Not because he's esoteric or anything, just his overwrought and turgid style. And rambling.
[28/01/2023, 23:45:17] Alex Regueiro: So perhaps I should appreciate it at least üòâ
[28/01/2023, 23:45:37] Alice Lafferty: But did he acknowledge at least some kind of relationship between noumena and phenomena
[28/01/2023, 23:45:53] Alice Lafferty: Surely not a causal one :/
[28/01/2023, 23:46:21] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I haven't touched it! Maybe someday
[28/01/2023, 23:47:10] Alice Lafferty: I may have misread the secondary sources... I sort of thought he emphasised subjective interpretation rather than an entirely different category of mental object.
[28/01/2023, 23:47:20] Alex Regueiro: Oh sure. I'm not sure how much he elaborated on it, but he considered phenomena to supervene upon the noumena, at the very least. (That's a very weak claim really.)
[28/01/2023, 23:47:47] Alex Regueiro: Famously most of the philosophers who followed him, in Germany and abroad, though he didn't say nearly enough about what the noumena are and how he knows they exist even.
[28/01/2023, 23:48:25] Alice Lafferty: Then he acknowledged that noumena were fundamental and phenomena were secondary? Ie the latter was caused by the former.
[28/01/2023, 23:48:32] Alex Regueiro: I can forgive him for that however. Pragmatist and constructivist approaches to that question answer it well I feel, but took at least another century to start developing!
[28/01/2023, 23:48:36] Alice Lafferty: That sounds much closer to physicalism
[28/01/2023, 23:48:42] Alex Regueiro: I think so yeah.
[28/01/2023, 23:48:47] Alex Regueiro: Not sure he'd phrase it in those terms though
[28/01/2023, 23:48:59] Alice Lafferty: Exactly..
[28/01/2023, 23:49:41] Alice Lafferty: So we don't 'impose our mental structures on the physical world' - doesn't the physical world impose our on our phenomena?
[28/01/2023, 23:50:41] Alice Lafferty: If he genuinely believed we only have access to phenomena, I don't know on what basis he thought he could comment on noumena at all.
[28/01/2023, 23:53:04] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, there's a great In Our Time episode on transcendental idealism, in case you're interested. üôÇ
[28/01/2023, 23:53:28] Alex Regueiro: It does, but he was making the point we can't access the noumena, only the phenomena.
[28/01/2023, 23:53:32] Alice Lafferty: Ok thanks, I will check it out.
[28/01/2023, 23:53:34] Alex Regueiro: Even if the phenomena supervene on the noumena.
[28/01/2023, 23:53:42] Alex Regueiro: It's called "Kant's Copernican Revolution" or something like that
[28/01/2023, 23:54:06] Alice Lafferty: I don't understand what you meant by this sentence.
[28/01/2023, 23:54:10] Alex Regueiro: Right, this is more or less what a lot of philosophers who followed him said. Even though by no means were they all subjective idealists or solipsists!
[28/01/2023, 23:55:14] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I was just confused by there being some implication mental events 'cause' physical ones whereas I had understood it to be the other way round.
[28/01/2023, 23:55:32] Alice Lafferty: Ha, it seems like a pretty glaring problem...
[28/01/2023, 23:55:35] Alex Regueiro: Definitely don't think of it as a causation.
[28/01/2023, 23:56:12] Alex Regueiro: In some ways yes. I used to think it was a dealbreaker. But he took the existence of an objective mind-independent world for granted, which maybe isn't philosophically very sophisticated, but we all do it at some level, like we've been saying! üòâ
[28/01/2023, 23:56:27] Alice Lafferty: Did Kant believe that 'we don't extrapolate and generalise from sensory experience' though?
[28/01/2023, 23:57:36] Alice Lafferty: In some ways solipsism is the most easily defended metaphysical theory and yet it somehow seems really juvenile at the same time.
[28/01/2023, 23:58:19] Alice Lafferty: He's fallen a bit in my estimation...üôÅ
[28/01/2023, 23:59:05] Alice Lafferty: Not that I could do any better than him, but he is one of the most influential philosophers in history...
[29/01/2023, 00:02:12] Alice Lafferty: Sorry to keep circling this same drain of a subject. It's very nice of you to indulge me. I might read some Fichte and Schelling and come back with something a bit fresher.
[29/01/2023, 00:03:14] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, just got drawn away from the computer a second
[29/01/2023, 00:03:17] Alice Lafferty: Please let me know how you find Ikiru
[29/01/2023, 00:03:50] Alex Regueiro: Well, I'm not sure he disbelieved it, but he certainly believed that's not the only way we interpret the world
[29/01/2023, 00:04:00] Alex Regueiro: And indeed modern neuroscience seems to support him, from what I can tell?
[29/01/2023, 00:04:18] Alex Regueiro: Not at all, it's good fun. Let me know what you think of Fichte and Schelling... I know literally nothing about them hah.
[29/01/2023, 00:05:27] Alex Regueiro: Well, you have Bertrand Russell for company, and other "great philosophers" too... I was once in the same boat, though I think it's grossly unfair to write him off so quickly, these days. Maybe the IOT episode will explain it better than me though, and warm you to Kant... well, almost surely it will do better than me!
[29/01/2023, 00:06:01] Alex Regueiro: Yes exactly haha. I knew one at Oxford, though I don't think she took it very serious. She was already sort of outgrowing it at the time. I was a full-on subjective idealist back then anyway!
[29/01/2023, 00:14:26] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, I'm going to go chill now. Lovely conversation, honestly, but I'd mentally exhaust myself if I keep it up any longer... and exhaust my fingers. (I don't know how you do this on the phone.)
[29/01/2023, 00:14:32] Alex Regueiro: I daresay this introvert has had too much conversation and social interaction today! üòÆ‚Äçüí®
[29/01/2023, 07:26:12] Alice Lafferty: Hm look at this Kant apologia: 'The concept of a noumenon is thus merely a limiting concept, the function of which is to curb the pretensions of sensibility, and it is therefore only of negative employment.'
[29/01/2023, 07:26:20] Alice Lafferty: Seems like back-pedalling to me.
[29/01/2023, 07:27:31] Alice Lafferty: He says it here in more or less those exact terms though: 'And we indeed, rightly considering objects of sense as mere appearances, confess thereby that they are based upon a thing in itself, though we know not this thing as it is in itself, but only know its appearances, viz., the way in which our senses are affected by this unknown something.' - Prolegomena, ¬ß 32
[29/01/2023, 07:29:22] Alice Lafferty: *'... we know not this thing as it is in itself, but only know its appearances, viz., the way in which our senses are affected by this unknown something.' * 

I actually think I had him correctly pinned from the start then. This sounds like straightforward indirect realism to me.
[29/01/2023, 07:31:34] Alice Lafferty: Did you know Bertrand Russell was a naive realist as well though..
[29/01/2023, 07:32:21] Alice Lafferty: Interestingly I don't get anywhere near so tired from digitally mediated socialising as I do from IRL socialising. But yes I do have a limit too.
[29/01/2023, 07:33:18] Alice Lafferty: Probably going to watch the Australian Open final now, which is on at 8:30am GMT.
[29/01/2023, 07:33:47] Alice Lafferty: Fichte is really, really interesting by the way.
[29/01/2023, 21:57:15] Alex Regueiro: Hey, sorry for the slow reply... busy day!
[29/01/2023, 21:58:00] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah that's a pathetically weasely response.
[29/01/2023, 21:59:09] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, I agreed with that characterisation of him. I fault Kant not so much for what he produced with his epistemology, which is full of great insights, but for not giving more attention to justifying the noumena.
[29/01/2023, 22:02:27] Alex Regueiro: But like I said, it's one of the most difficult problems in all epistemology, and fairly major developments have been made right up to the turn of the millennium, you can rightly say! Would have been even more impressive for Kant, as great a philosopher as he was, to introduce some form of pragmatism... but I can't chastise him too much for not doing that. It would have been nice if he had at least been more honest and open about failing to give this concept more attention, but still...
[29/01/2023, 22:03:36] Alex Regueiro: I vaguely recall that, but had forgotten to be honest. It's funny, my respect for Russell has decreased over time whilst my respect for Kant has increased.
[29/01/2023, 22:03:40] Alex Regueiro: Used to be the complete opposite.
[29/01/2023, 22:04:20] Alex Regueiro: I was half kidding anyway. And I know what you mean... maybe it was just a long day. Anyway, you seem to have timed your exit nicely regardless. üôÇ
[29/01/2023, 22:07:03] Alex Regueiro: I saw the highlights. Always looked like an easy win for Djokovic to be fair. I'm not his biggest fan, but I respect him a lot. Tsitsipas is just annoying and all-round rather dislikable.
[29/01/2023, 22:07:24] Alex Regueiro: It didn't look the most entertaining... so I hope you gave up and dozed off!
[29/01/2023, 22:07:39] Alex Regueiro: You might have been more entertained watching me play today... in one way or another. ü§î
[29/01/2023, 22:08:01] Alex Regueiro: I really should check him out. I've occasionally heard good things too. What do you like in particular about his philosophy?
[30/01/2023, 03:00:44] Alice Lafferty: I can't really count this as slow, given that I often take days or even weeks to get back to people. I absolutely never hold it against anyone.
[30/01/2023, 03:00:50] Alice Lafferty: What have you been doingv
[30/01/2023, 03:00:54] Alice Lafferty: *?
[30/01/2023, 03:01:38] Alice Lafferty: Yes to be fair it's not like there's something very obvious that he missed.
[30/01/2023, 03:03:53] Alice Lafferty: I was actually privately rooting for Tsitsipas because Djokovic annoys me because of his cringe "love me" celebrations and overexposure probably. But yeah neither are very likeable.
[30/01/2023, 03:04:33] Alice Lafferty: Ha probably, who do you normally play with anyway?
[30/01/2023, 03:04:33] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair. You've been good since you got yourself out of your January blues stage though! üôÇ
[30/01/2023, 03:04:58] Alex Regueiro: I was actually just planning on going to bed, so I better not wake myself up (sorry)
[30/01/2023, 03:05:05] Alex Regueiro: Will answer you properly tomorrow!
[30/01/2023, 03:05:19] Alice Lafferty: Well, I don't agree with him particularly, or even at all - he's basically a subjective idealist (v similar to Burke actually...!), but definitely interesting.
‚Äé[30/01/2023, 03:05:40] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[30/01/2023, 03:07:31] Alice Lafferty: I think you'd like him. I remember you said that you thought 'ontologies were produced inter-subjectively', right? Pretty much the same thing... he thinks phenomena are produced by consciousnesses interacting with each other reciprocally, doing away with Kant's thing-in-itself or noumena. 

Obviously you have to query the epistemological basis of other minds, as with noumena... but apparently this is resolved later on. I haven't finished reading yet :)
[30/01/2023, 03:08:14] Alice Lafferty: Ok! Good night
[30/01/2023, 03:09:19] Alice Lafferty: Haha, if only he had injected a bit of that wit into his metaphysics treaties... I'm not actually sure what their relationship was like but I imagine a bit antagonistic yeah!
[30/01/2023, 18:50:59] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I can definitely see why that annoys you. Indeed, neither is exactly endearing to tennis fans...
[30/01/2023, 18:51:14] Alex Regueiro: Although at least Djokovic gets my respect in other ways.
[30/01/2023, 18:51:21] Alex Regueiro: I'm still a Federer guy through and throuhg!
[30/01/2023, 18:52:42] Alex Regueiro: It varies. I only picked up tennis again and joined this club last October. I've been slow to arrange singles games with people... so up to now I'm mainly going to group training and also practising with the young semi-pro guy there (I pay him a little, I'm not that good!).
[30/01/2023, 18:53:42] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I thought he sought to develop and flesh out transcendental idealism? So how can he be a subjective idealist?
[30/01/2023, 18:53:52] Alex Regueiro: But in that case no wonder Kant turned against him after initially endorsing him...
[30/01/2023, 18:54:12] Alex Regueiro: Do let me know your thoughts after you finish, I'd be curious. üôÇ
[30/01/2023, 18:55:06] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. His style is far too dry and tedious, however good his philosophy is. Hume is a pleasure to read on the other hand. (And he inspired Kant of course.)
[30/01/2023, 22:23:54] Alice Lafferty: Rafa for meü´°
[30/01/2023, 22:24:26] Alice Lafferty: Woah can you hold your own against him?
[30/01/2023, 23:39:43] Alex Regueiro: Nooo
[30/01/2023, 23:39:57] Alex Regueiro: I mean, again, I really respect his ability, but his character not to much
[30/01/2023, 23:40:06] Alex Regueiro: I don't find his style particularly entertaining either
[30/01/2023, 23:40:12] Alex Regueiro: Too much abotu brute force
[30/01/2023, 23:40:46] Alex Regueiro: Not quite. If he plays all out I'd get some points off him for sure, but I don't think I'd get a game... unless I was playing really well on the day maybe ha!
[31/01/2023, 00:01:32] Alex Regueiro: So how's being home alone? Did your parents and brother leave on Sunday?
‚Äé[01/02/2023, 01:44:05] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[01/02/2023, 01:44:09] Alex Regueiro: Always shooting from the hip. He called Hegel a "charlatan" too.
[01/02/2023, 08:24:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes he is like el toroüêÆ
[01/02/2023, 08:25:09] Alice Lafferty: (couldn't really find a bull emojiü§î)
[01/02/2023, 08:27:39] Alice Lafferty: That is impressive though. Do you know what his world rank is?
[01/02/2023, 08:28:34] Alice Lafferty: Saturday yeah. It's been a relief actually, I like having the house all to myself.
[01/02/2023, 08:29:51] Alice Lafferty: A "flat-headed, insipid, nauseating, illiterate charlatan" at that!
[01/02/2023, 08:30:38] Alice Lafferty: Haha all though he was basically an idealist too I believe, and had a totally schizophrenic approach to the thing-in-itself.
[01/02/2023, 08:31:28] Alice Lafferty: At least Fichte attempted a sound epistemology!
[01/02/2023, 08:31:57] Alice Lafferty: By the way I could not find the In Our Times episode on transcendental idealism... were you just referring to the one on Kant?
[01/02/2023, 08:32:18] Alice Lafferty: Sorry for taking so long to reply again! Will you see later on anyway.
[01/02/2023, 08:32:49] Alice Lafferty: I will probably be there around 7:15. Do you have final numbers?
[01/02/2023, 16:12:01] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. That emoji makes him seem cute and gentle...
[01/02/2023, 16:12:07] Alex Regueiro: üêÇ maybe?
[01/02/2023, 16:12:16] Alex Regueiro: 1500 I think
[01/02/2023, 16:12:47] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, I can sympathise with that. Maybe after a week it gets lonely, but I love it at first!
[01/02/2023, 16:12:50] Alex Regueiro: Are you cooking for yourself?
[01/02/2023, 16:13:18] Alex Regueiro: Haha did he really use all those adjectives? Wonderful.
[01/02/2023, 16:13:26] Alex Regueiro: (And pretty accurate)
[01/02/2023, 16:14:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I don't by the the whole thing about it emanating from the "will". But at least he was a relatively clear writer, which Fichte wasn't and even less so Hegel!
[01/02/2023, 16:14:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's called "Kant's Copernican Revolution" (just looked it up). But it's all about his epistemology and transcendental idealism.
[01/02/2023, 16:14:48] Alex Regueiro: No worries. üôÇ
[01/02/2023, 16:15:19] Alex Regueiro: Look forward to seeing you later! 7:15 is a good time. Not entirely sure on numbers, but it will be a good turnout. 14+ as far as I can tell.
[01/02/2023, 18:31:32] Alice Lafferty: I started listening to it this eveningüëå
[01/02/2023, 18:32:47] Alice Lafferty: Could have been you...
[01/02/2023, 18:32:57] Alice Lafferty: I guess they don't even really break even at that level?
[01/02/2023, 18:33:55] Alice Lafferty: Yes I do notice I get kind of 'weird' after a week... so it's good that I'm going to socialise this evening.
[01/02/2023, 18:34:29] Alice Lafferty: Ok great!
[01/02/2023, 18:40:32] Alex Regueiro: Super. üòÄ
[01/02/2023, 18:41:17] Alex Regueiro: Hah not likely. Maybe if I didn‚Äôt have such chronically poor stamina and played more seriously when I was young‚Ä¶
[01/02/2023, 18:41:33] Alex Regueiro: This guy is 19 still, I think
[01/02/2023, 18:42:00] Alice Lafferty: I wss just wondering where I should go when I get there - did you hire a room?
[01/02/2023, 18:42:27] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. It‚Äôs like university education‚Ä¶ an expensive gamble (investment?) on one‚Äôs future. Prize money is very low at his level.
[01/02/2023, 18:42:27] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. He still has time to rise up I guess
[01/02/2023, 18:42:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. He‚Äôll probably never be top 100 but who knows. Aim is to get a Wimbledon wildcard eventually.
[01/02/2023, 18:43:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it will help break up the otherwise pleasant solitude.
[01/02/2023, 18:43:59] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I can meet you outside maybe. Since it‚Äôs not obvious which entrance to use even.
[01/02/2023, 18:44:27] Alice Lafferty: Sorry!
[01/02/2023, 18:44:46] Alice Lafferty: You're basically in the organisational role tonight right? So you might be busy
[01/02/2023, 18:44:51] Alex Regueiro: Not at all. I wandered around confused the first time as well.
[01/02/2023, 18:44:57] Alice Lafferty: I'm about to get on the underground soüëã
[01/02/2023, 18:44:58] Alex Regueiro: Sort of but don‚Äôt worry.
[01/02/2023, 18:45:08] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll be arriving about 7:15 anyway
[01/02/2023, 18:45:14] Alex Regueiro: üëåüèº
[01/02/2023, 18:45:27] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[01/02/2023, 19:36:28] Alice Lafferty: I'm here
[01/02/2023, 19:36:54] Alice Lafferty: Only 20 minutes late!
[01/02/2023, 19:40:44] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[01/02/2023, 19:39:44] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéMissed voice call
[01/02/2023, 23:28:40] Alex Regueiro: Haha just saw this
[01/02/2023, 23:29:04] Alex Regueiro: Glad you weren‚Äôt waiting long at least.
[01/02/2023, 23:46:39] Alex Regueiro: By the way I wanted to say you did great participating for your first time‚Ä¶ even if you did put yourself down more than necessary haha!
[01/02/2023, 23:52:50] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, that's just reflexive! Thank you
[01/02/2023, 23:53:34] Alice Lafferty: I will say thank you to Zarina (yes?) on the group chat in the morning.
[01/02/2023, 23:54:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I figured hah. Some day I‚Äôll manage to convince you you have a lot more going for you than you think!
[01/02/2023, 23:55:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah no worries. She wouldn‚Äôt be offended if you didn‚Äôt but sounds good anyway.
[01/02/2023, 23:55:53] Alex Regueiro: Hope your journey back is nice and smooth‚Ä¶
[01/02/2023, 23:59:29] Alice Lafferty: Hm!
[01/02/2023, 23:59:38] Alice Lafferty: Yep just walking back from the tube station now
[01/02/2023, 23:59:43] Alice Lafferty: How was yours?
[02/02/2023, 00:01:49] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. I had to wait for the 4th train for the Epping branch. üòê Otherwise fine.
[02/02/2023, 00:02:35] Alex Regueiro: The eternal skeptic eh. I‚Äôll convince you that structures are real too, in time!
[02/02/2023, 00:06:21] Alice Lafferty: I'm sorry about that!
[02/02/2023, 00:07:29] Alice Lafferty: Didn't we establish that structuralism kind of lead you to subjective idealism though??
[02/02/2023, 00:07:33] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to invent a new metaphysics called 'murkism'.
[02/02/2023, 00:09:11] Alice Lafferty: Where matter exists as murky sludge and consciousness imbues it with discernible properties.
[02/02/2023, 00:10:38] Alice Lafferty: Not entirely eliminative towards the physical world but eliminative towards its features.
[02/02/2023, 00:10:54] Alice Lafferty: I'm aware this already falls under the umbrella of indirect realism.
[02/02/2023, 00:10:55] Alex Regueiro: Noo. I‚Äôll have to explain myself better! It is non realist about entities though so I can see why you think that
[02/02/2023, 00:11:51] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôm used to it. Evidently all the train drivers live in Hainult. And God only knows why, given the salaries they‚Äôre on!
[02/02/2023, 00:12:01] Alice Lafferty: - ante rem structuralism is just platonism in a wig
[02/02/2023, 00:12:01] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[02/02/2023, 00:12:16] Alice Lafferty: - post rem structuralism is just idealism
[02/02/2023, 00:12:32] Alice Lafferty: - in rem structuralism is epistemologically challenged imo.
[02/02/2023, 00:13:08] Alice Lafferty: Ha!
[02/02/2023, 00:13:13] Alex Regueiro: Funny you say that because when you said that at the pub it struck me as quite like Quinean pragmatism.
[02/02/2023, 00:13:59] Alice Lafferty: When I said what sorry?
[02/02/2023, 00:14:00] Alex Regueiro: Hah, agreed on this. It‚Äôs frankly poppycock.
[02/02/2023, 00:14:25] Alice Lafferty: Is there are secret fourth kind of structuralism I've missed?
[02/02/2023, 00:14:49] Alex Regueiro: Something about murk as I recall. Something existing but lacking any real form or quality. Inherent attributes of any sort.
[02/02/2023, 00:15:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes. I couldn't really think of a better word that captures it!
[02/02/2023, 00:15:58] Alex Regueiro: It definitely shares common ground. I realised that when writing my philosophy of maths essay, the one I showed you!
[02/02/2023, 00:16:19] Alex Regueiro: It‚Äôs actually kind of apt. I got you at least.
[02/02/2023, 00:17:14] Alice Lafferty: So which kind of structuralism is salvageable?
[02/02/2023, 00:18:20] Alice Lafferty: Yes I remember, although I thought you posited the actual existence of mind-independent structure.
[02/02/2023, 00:18:29] Alice Lafferty: Correct me if I'm wrong though
[02/02/2023, 00:20:36] Alex Regueiro: Ah, well that's where I have to quibble. The mind-independent structures, for me, are an inevitable conclusion (explicitly the outcome, not what's assumed) when you adopt a pragmatic-constructivist stance on natural science.
[02/02/2023, 00:20:58] Alex Regueiro: That's what I was trying to show in my essay sort of
[02/02/2023, 00:21:13] Alex Regueiro: So I don't really like any of the rem/re characterisations, even if ante rem comes the closest metaphysically...
[02/02/2023, 00:21:23] Alex Regueiro: (Home now)
[02/02/2023, 00:21:44] Alice Lafferty: Something like: they must exist because otherwise we wouldn't be able to so accurately predict physical events?
[02/02/2023, 00:22:26] Alice Lafferty: I guess you could be ante-rem and still a nominalist.
[02/02/2023, 00:23:02] Alex Regueiro: Right. That's sort of the No Miracles Argument. Which I presented a (purportedly) more sophisticated version of in my paper. The idea that theory change (either of the evolutionary or revolutionary sort) offers a structural embedding, and this is transitive of course.
[02/02/2023, 00:23:37] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[02/02/2023, 00:23:37] Alex Regueiro: From which we must conclude we're just homing in on the same objective structure, with greater resolution as our scientific theories progress.
[02/02/2023, 00:23:46] Alex Regueiro: Does that make sense, roughly?
[02/02/2023, 00:24:47] Alice Lafferty: Yes I actually said this (that we can approach 'truth' asymptotically) to Izzy (correct spelling?) at the beginning...
[02/02/2023, 00:24:59] Alice Lafferty: It does make sense.
[02/02/2023, 00:25:26] Alex Regueiro: But since the structure embedding seems to always be there (from earlier scientific theories that have proven their predictive power to later ones that encompass them), we can infer that the structure of nature has some sort of existence outside of our human construction of successively improving theories...
[02/02/2023, 00:25:40] Alice Lafferty: I guess I am still reserved about the extent to which the structure we perceive corresponds with actual reality.
[02/02/2023, 00:25:44] Alex Regueiro: ...even if the entities and the languages we use to describe those theories are very much man-made and not "objectively real"
[02/02/2023, 00:26:21] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I think I made a similar point in that paper, but regardless I'm definitely with you here
[02/02/2023, 00:26:21] Alice Lafferty: But your position definitely makes sense!
[02/02/2023, 00:26:36] Alex Regueiro: And yeah, that's the right spelling. üôÇ
[02/02/2023, 00:27:00] Alex Regueiro: Although you might see even me write Izzie occasionally...
[02/02/2023, 00:28:20] Alice Lafferty: I'm now reading a paper critiquing the No Miracles argument... have to be thorough ;)
[02/02/2023, 00:28:26] Alex Regueiro: I think the best answer to that is an elaborated form of the No Miracles Argument that shows how stable good scientific theories are upon so-called "theory change". But basically I'm an ontic structural realist, and beyond that al the refinements and nuances are my own personal half-developed ideas.
[02/02/2023, 00:28:36] Alice Lafferty: But I cannot see any issues with it so far...
[02/02/2023, 00:28:43] Alex Regueiro: Ooh. You don't waste any time eh!
[02/02/2023, 00:28:45] Alex Regueiro: Good stuff
[02/02/2023, 00:29:15] Alex Regueiro: I can send you some both for and against, if you fancy... I made a collection of them when writing that paper.
[02/02/2023, 00:30:02] Alice Lafferty: Were they any convincing anti-scientific realist arguments? (I guess not otherwise you wouldn't hold it as a position!)
[02/02/2023, 00:31:14] Alice Lafferty: It's confusing because Putnam seemed to change his mind a lot?
[02/02/2023, 00:31:22] Alex Regueiro: Anti to scientific realism rather than anti-scientific varieties of realism, I take it?!
[02/02/2023, 00:31:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes!
[02/02/2023, 00:31:41] Alex Regueiro: English hyphenation rules let us down here, alas... even though you were being quite grammatical.
[02/02/2023, 00:32:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes sorry maybe anti-'scientific realism' is better
[02/02/2023, 00:32:22] Alex Regueiro: No indeed. I looked at two or three for my paper, but wasn't overly impressed.
[02/02/2023, 00:32:49] Alex Regueiro: I'd like to think my refinements address why they're insufficient anyway. Though I concede I would need to flesh things out a bit more to fully convince people.
[02/02/2023, 00:33:07] Alex Regueiro: Clearer but less grammatically orthodox. üôÇ
[02/02/2023, 00:33:49] Alex Regueiro: Most of the arguments are based around the fact we've abandoned "bad" scientific theories in the past, like phlogiston, or calorific.
[02/02/2023, 00:34:08] Alice Lafferty: Seems to be one from 'underdetermination', ie. we have insufficient evidence that any of our claims are true. I'm not familiar with what kind of standard of evidence a theory has to meet before it's accepted in the scientific community, so I won't comment on that.
[02/02/2023, 00:34:38] Alex Regueiro: But I argue they still had some predictive power even if they were ultimately dead ends. And a structural embedding (in a well-defined mathematical sense) nevertheless exists between those theories and our current ones in the corresponding domains.
[02/02/2023, 00:35:29] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly, they still refer descriptively to the same aspects of the world, if you see what I mean.
[02/02/2023, 00:37:41] Alex Regueiro: Sort of by the way, I would say that ontic structural realism and murkism seem to agree or at least half agree on what is objectively real. üòâ What does exist is terribly murky, some sort of amorphous blob if you like, or a mathematical structure if you're being more platonic (nonetheless one which we can only approach full knowledge of asymptotically). But in opposition to platonism we don't start (epistemologically) with these structures or "ideals". We arrive at them after putting in the legwork. We start with a weaker position, like constructive empricism.
[02/02/2023, 00:37:56] Alex Regueiro: I do, I think
[02/02/2023, 00:38:40] Alex Regueiro: Maybe at a very abstract level, but they are still capable of somewhat accurate predictions, as long as you restrict the domain sufficiently, in whichever case.
[02/02/2023, 00:38:47] Alex Regueiro: So, yes....
[02/02/2023, 00:39:36] Alex Regueiro: I haven't read a great deal of Putnam, but I suspect you're right. In any case he's never spelt out the NMA quite as clearly as I would have liked..
[02/02/2023, 00:40:21] Alice Lafferty: Hm yes I think so. In the very outdated theological terms I'm comfortable with, you could say something like mind provides form to 'amorphous' matter.
[02/02/2023, 00:41:02] Alice Lafferty: It becomes tricky when the mind itself necessarily arises from matter... which is again why I think the problem of consciousness is so fundamental.
[02/02/2023, 00:42:39] Alex Regueiro: Right, I see what you're getting at... There's something Kantian here too!
[02/02/2023, 00:43:39] Alex Regueiro: Although there are still "noumena" in the world of ontic structural realism, just they aren't entities per se. (Incidentally, I totally agree with Schopenhauer about Kant misusing that word, and love how he cites Ancient Greek writers to show it.)
[02/02/2023, 00:44:04] Alex Regueiro: Reminds me... I'm sure you've heard the old pun?
[02/02/2023, 00:44:16] Alice Lafferty: I know! But it doesn't really make sense that the brain is able to pick out features of the world in such extraordinary detail, if those features are not inherent to matter itself.
[02/02/2023, 00:45:18] Alice Lafferty: For you structure is emergent though right?
[02/02/2023, 00:45:36] Alex Regueiro: Epistemologically emergent, metaphysically fundamental, if you get what I'm saying?
[02/02/2023, 00:45:56] Alice Lafferty: Ah I think this is where disagree.
[02/02/2023, 00:46:18] Alice Lafferty: I think it's also metaphysically emergent, and the human brain reifies emergent properties of matter as structure, in some sense.
[02/02/2023, 00:46:27] Alice Lafferty: * we disagree
[02/02/2023, 00:46:31] Alex Regueiro: And I agree on this. But like I was saying at the pub, metaphysics exists as a discipline, and takes the forms it does, because of the structures and habits built into the human mind.
[02/02/2023, 00:46:54] Alex Regueiro: Hmm. What *is* metaphysically fundamental then?
[02/02/2023, 00:46:57] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure what you're referring to!
[02/02/2023, 00:47:41] Alex Regueiro: "What is mind? No matter... What is matter? Never mind."
[02/02/2023, 00:47:51] Alex Regueiro: I know, it's terrible. But also brilliant.
[02/02/2023, 00:47:52] Alice Lafferty: Hm I haven't read about this but I'm happy to have another instrument with which to dissect Kant...
[02/02/2023, 00:48:05] Alice Lafferty: Matter
[02/02/2023, 00:48:23] Alice Lafferty: 'Energy'
[02/02/2023, 00:48:31] Alice Lafferty: I don't mean that in a hippie way.
[02/02/2023, 00:48:46] Alex Regueiro: It's allll vibraaations duuude.
[02/02/2023, 00:49:38] Alice Lafferty: Murk is metaphysically fundamental..
[02/02/2023, 00:49:51] Alex Regueiro: That's the thing. If you really dig down into physics, you realise that matter and energy are very much human constructs too. Highly intuitive and useful ones (especially matter is intuitive), but nonetheless not objective or fundamental.
[02/02/2023, 00:50:00] Alice Lafferty: Ha, no I have heard this before
[02/02/2023, 00:50:17] Alice Lafferty: Ok so keep stripping away at it
[02/02/2023, 00:50:20] Alex Regueiro: They're still transcendental concepts, in Kantian lingo.
[02/02/2023, 00:50:27] Alex Regueiro: Matter and energy
[02/02/2023, 00:50:58] Alice Lafferty: I think humans will never 'conceive' of like bare noumena or whatever because of our propensity to categorise.
[02/02/2023, 00:51:33] Alice Lafferty: So physics as an exploratory exercise will probably never be truly satisfying in that way (obviously still incredibly practically useful)
[02/02/2023, 00:51:37] Alex Regueiro: Physicalism = materialism from a philosophy of science perspective, but adherents much prefer the former term these days because it's far more general, and we realise "matter" doesn't encompass nearly everything in the physical universe.
[02/02/2023, 00:51:46] Alex Regueiro: Right!
[02/02/2023, 00:52:06] Alice Lafferty: I know, I guess I was using 'next-best thing' terms
[02/02/2023, 00:52:38] Alice Lafferty: This is where 'murk' comes in handy
[02/02/2023, 00:52:52] Alex Regueiro: Even these "structural noumena" I talk about aren't accessible to us mere mortals. The best we can do is represent them with mathematics, which is already moving away from the thing-in-itself.
[02/02/2023, 00:53:05] Alice Lafferty: üòÇ
[02/02/2023, 00:53:08] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I might even have to adopt the term... has it been trademarked yet?
[02/02/2023, 00:53:52] Alex Regueiro: Structural murk, perhaps, but murk nonetheless! Ultimately inaccessible.
[02/02/2023, 00:53:53] Alice Lafferty: Is it possible to sort of reconcile scientific realism with idealism?
[02/02/2023, 00:54:00] Alice Lafferty: That's sort of what I'm getting at
[02/02/2023, 00:54:43] Alex Regueiro: With transcendental idealism? Absolutely, I'd say
[02/02/2023, 00:54:50] Alex Regueiro: Well
[02/02/2023, 00:55:21] Alex Regueiro: You can reconcile constructivism empiricism (cf. Van Fraassen) with subjective idealism, but yeah, constructive realism explicitly falls short of realism.
[02/02/2023, 00:55:50] Alice Lafferty: Hm, when comparing eg. a vacuum with planet earth, are all differences between the two entirely constructed?
[02/02/2023, 00:56:23] Alice Lafferty: Hm I don't get scientific realism then.
[02/02/2023, 00:56:38] Alex Regueiro: What don't you think you get?
[02/02/2023, 00:57:20] Alex Regueiro: The differences are objective and structural I would say. Profound differences even. It's the entities and language and rules/laws we use to describe them that are constructed.
[02/02/2023, 00:57:29] Alice Lafferty: If as you say concepts such as matter are constructs, then you are not making any claims about their reality? Or is this just the asymptotic model.
[02/02/2023, 00:58:13] Alice Lafferty: Yes I admit I do find it difficult to believe that _all_ differences in the physical world are entirely produced by the human mind.
[02/02/2023, 00:58:43] Alex Regueiro: Right. That's kind of the No Miracles argument, in its most simplistic form
[02/02/2023, 00:59:16] Alex Regueiro: I'm saying that there are objective structures in nature that we mere humans conceptualise as "matter" (and there's nothing wrong with this)
[02/02/2023, 00:59:36] Alice Lafferty: I guess I'm still thinking about the more immediate examples like the table. I can believe that tables are emergent phenomena but that becomes more difficult in the cases like vacuums.
[02/02/2023, 01:00:51] Alice Lafferty: * I mean that tables are emergent _mental_ phenomena.
[02/02/2023, 01:01:14] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I have your position pinned down now I think! SorryüòÖ
[02/02/2023, 01:03:51] Alex Regueiro: Right. If we just talk about everyday experience and everyday objects, it's almost possible to be a naive realist! But alas, the world is not so simple when you start investigating closer...
[02/02/2023, 01:04:48] Alex Regueiro: Don't be sorry. I have fun discussing this! I can't refine my own positions with others questioning it in an intelligent way. Trying to elucidate it.
[02/02/2023, 01:05:59] Alice Lafferty: I guess the only question I have left is: how can you know that these profound differences really exist - or exist in the way that you think they do - if the entities we use to describe them are indeed constructed.
[02/02/2023, 01:07:41] Alice Lafferty: It should be as simple as: there is matter at point X, there is no matter at point Y, but as you said, you can increasingly deconstruct a concept like matter, and indeed spacetime.
[02/02/2023, 01:11:02] Alex Regueiro: Well some difference must exist somewhere, either in objective reality or in our minds, right? And if it's only in our minds, then our minds have still internally constructed some universe with consistent laws (and internal structure), so we might as well call that objective reality, for all intents and purposes.
[02/02/2023, 01:11:34] Alice Lafferty: I think it does still matter whether it's in our minds or 'out there' though
[02/02/2023, 01:12:00] Alex Regueiro: Yep. That's such a tempting view, until you realise how conceptually tricky fundamental physics can get. It really helps to go into the physics itself here, in fact. Happy to explain that to you some time... might help shed some light on why I don't believe in fundamental entities, for example.
[02/02/2023, 01:12:12] Alice Lafferty: I agree now that it seems nearly impossible that our mind could essentially invent all of the structure we see.
[02/02/2023, 01:12:34] Alex Regueiro: If they're indistinguishable though, why care? What does it even mean to be "out there" if there is no external reality though, or external reality is trivially uniform?
[02/02/2023, 01:13:40] Alice Lafferty: If external reality is uniform (eg. murky), how can brains possibly hallucinate heterogeneity.
[02/02/2023, 01:14:38] Alice Lafferty: There's also the problem again that minds are themselves accommodated in matter to some extent.
[02/02/2023, 01:15:10] Alex Regueiro: I wasn't quite sure what you meant by minds constructing "everything", but yes, I would say unless you're a radical substance dualist (and there's no good motivation for this), this position is untenable.
[02/02/2023, 01:15:12] Alice Lafferty: What's the difference (epistemologically) between believing in fundamental structure and fundamental entities?
[02/02/2023, 01:15:31] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[02/02/2023, 01:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Yes, this same question has occurred to me... I think it's just one of degree (level of abstraction), at least insofar as metaphysics is concerned. But in terms of epistemology, you're basically reversing your axioms/inferences/conclusions relative to traditional platonism
[02/02/2023, 01:16:46] Alice Lafferty: Eg. what is my brain 'made of', how does it work etc.
[02/02/2023, 01:17:12] Alex Regueiro: Plato: posit ideal forms -> worldly imperfect manifestations of these forms
[02/02/2023, 01:18:34] Alex Regueiro: OSR: posit entities and rules (the metaphysics) -> analyse how they all fit together into a coherent system and demonstrate their empirical predictive power -> infer the existence of structures that are resistant to theory change, hence objective
[02/02/2023, 01:18:50] Alex Regueiro: That's perhaps just my own particular brand of OSR though üôÇ
[02/02/2023, 01:19:05] Alex Regueiro: Right
[02/02/2023, 01:19:58] Alice Lafferty: Hm the whole thing still rests on those first posited entities and rules though
[02/02/2023, 01:20:09] Alice Lafferty: Also you could argue that platonism is also resistant to theory change.
[02/02/2023, 01:20:22] Alex Regueiro: If minds aren't somehow ground in or emergent from matter and physics, what do they come from, and how can we simultaneously explain that physical changes to the brain demonstrably give rise to changes in consciousness? This is arguably the major flaw of subjective idealism and solipsism.
[02/02/2023, 01:21:00] Alice Lafferty: But I agree that it in the spirit of conservatism, structuralism is better because you don't have to explain the realm of forms etc
[02/02/2023, 01:21:02] Alex Regueiro: Sure, but you realise in this process that the posited metaphysics is kind of arbitrary at some level. It's constructed on a pragmatic basis.
[02/02/2023, 01:21:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[02/02/2023, 01:21:32] Alice Lafferty: So it does matter what is 'out there'
[02/02/2023, 01:22:18] Alice Lafferty: It's all just arbitrary... ?üôÅ
[02/02/2023, 01:22:57] Alice Lafferty: I mean, the mind might be able to bring the world into existence but it cannot bring itself into existence haha
[02/02/2023, 01:23:15] Alex Regueiro: Depends what exactly one means by platonism. But granting you that it is, it still suffers from the "epistemological access problem" (as do Kant's noumena for that matter).
[02/02/2023, 01:23:40] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes... but remember causality is just a mental structure we impose on the world. üòâ
[02/02/2023, 01:23:44] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[02/02/2023, 01:24:36] Alex Regueiro: I have a big article on causality open on my iPad, I really need to get around to reading it... looks interesting, all sorts of different positions. It characterises them all and places them in relation to each other and historical development.
[02/02/2023, 01:25:04] Alice Lafferty: So to be clear: you think that a mind-independent reality exists, and that it definitely has some features ('structure'), it is not totally formless.
[02/02/2023, 01:25:31] Alice Lafferty: Well then doesn't that mess up our entire scientific understanding then.
[02/02/2023, 01:25:35] Alex Regueiro: For me, the only satisfactory answer to the epistemological access problem (since naive realism is so blatantly false) is constructivism: that we posit/declare our entities in our minds and see what follows from there.
[02/02/2023, 01:25:53] Alex Regueiro: Exactly
[02/02/2023, 01:25:56] Alice Lafferty: Kind of a good argument against scientific realism no?
[02/02/2023, 01:26:20] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[02/02/2023, 01:26:21] Alex Regueiro: If it were totally formless, we'd have to say everything is mind, and we've just been talking about that... and both rightly dismissing it, I think!
[02/02/2023, 01:26:31] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[02/02/2023, 01:26:48] Alice Lafferty: Hm I'm still going to think about it more.
[02/02/2023, 01:26:50] Alex Regueiro: Sorry if this diverges from the Great School of Murk. üòî
[02/02/2023, 01:27:19] Alice Lafferty: It does. You are a post-Murkian
[02/02/2023, 01:27:24] Alice Lafferty: And so am I, rapidly!
[02/02/2023, 01:27:25] Alex Regueiro: Not necessarily. Our scientific theories are already inevitably couched in human-created objects, human language, etc.
[02/02/2023, 01:27:50] Alice Lafferty: Are there any metaphysics which posit causality as being fundamental?
[02/02/2023, 01:28:05] Alice Lafferty: That you know of?
[02/02/2023, 01:28:50] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. It's an important stepping stone regardless though. I'm just glad you're so keen to examine your own thoughts here and try to work through everything... That's the true essence of philosophy, for me. (Not metaphysics or fancy sophistical jargon or god knows what else.)
[02/02/2023, 01:29:05] Alex Regueiro: Oh sure
[02/02/2023, 01:29:57] Alice Lafferty: I find the no miracles argument very convincing. It hasn't led me to embrace structuralism, particularly though. Maybe just another form of indirect realism.
[02/02/2023, 01:30:14] Alex Regueiro: You could argue the standard metaphysics of physics is still more-or-less causal, despite the deep problems that relativity and quantum mechanics have created for it.
[02/02/2023, 01:30:33] Alex Regueiro: Not to mention more purely philosophical objections to causality, which have been around for al ong time...
[02/02/2023, 01:31:25] Alice Lafferty: I can buy that most Aristotelian categories are constructs but causality seems different at least superficially.
[02/02/2023, 01:32:05] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[02/02/2023, 01:32:57] Alex Regueiro: I like so many things about Aristotle, but I'm not sure I can ever forgive him for making "causes" so fundamental to philosophy and science!
[02/02/2023, 01:33:39] Alex Regueiro: The four courses don't strike me as particularly useful notions even for his age...
[02/02/2023, 01:34:23] Alex Regueiro: Perhaps this is a tiny bit unfair though... privilege of being a 21st C man with some understanding of modern physics.
[02/02/2023, 01:34:38] Alice Lafferty: It's been quite useful in most practical science though, no?
[02/02/2023, 01:35:12] Alice Lafferty: Especially until fairly recently?
[02/02/2023, 01:35:18] Alex Regueiro: It certainly does. Took me a long time to grapple with it. Now, my answer would simply be that it's so deeply ingrained into our psychology, we can scarcely conceive of a world without causality, and that's all.
[02/02/2023, 01:36:02] Alice Lafferty: That's definitely true
[02/02/2023, 01:36:05] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah it's definitely helped us conceptualise a great deal of scientific phenomena, and still does. It's just less and less useful the more fundamental you get, I'd say.
[02/02/2023, 01:36:19] Alex Regueiro: To be fair my bigger beef is with his semi-arbitrary division into four types of causes.
[02/02/2023, 01:36:21] Alice Lafferty: No real comment on its reality though I guess
[02/02/2023, 01:36:48] Alice Lafferty: Semi-arbitrary? More like totally arbitrary
[02/02/2023, 01:38:03] Alice Lafferty: I see
[02/02/2023, 01:38:51] Alice Lafferty: Very useful to have a physics background here ofc
[02/02/2023, 01:40:18] Alice Lafferty: I'm gonna have a shower

[02/02/2023, 01:42:59] Alex Regueiro: Don't feel remotely obliged! Just in case one or more of them takes your fancy...
[02/02/2023, 01:43:15] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, was busy digging those up.
[02/02/2023, 01:43:29] Alex Regueiro: Yes hah
[02/02/2023, 01:43:35] Alice Lafferty: Ha thank you for collecting these for me!
[02/02/2023, 01:43:43] Alice Lafferty: I will take a look
[02/02/2023, 01:44:10] Alice Lafferty: Saves me having to haggle with jstor or whatever
[02/02/2023, 01:44:32] Alex Regueiro: No worries! They were already in my research folder for that one paper, so I just had to find that and filter out the overly technical/irrelevant ones. I think these are all well within your grasp.
[02/02/2023, 01:44:47] Alex Regueiro: Ha yes. Enjoy your unfettered access to online journals while it lasts...
[02/02/2023, 01:45:13] Alex Regueiro: I still have JSTOR as an Oxford almnus, but not everything is there. üôÅ
[02/02/2023, 01:45:56] Alex Regueiro: Have a nice relaxing shower... I find my best philosophical thoughts come in the shower or on walks!
[02/02/2023, 01:46:00] Alex Regueiro: Good night x
[02/02/2023, 01:46:18] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I appreciate it anyway!
[02/02/2023, 01:46:57] Alex Regueiro: Gladly. Will be curious to hear your thoughts about any of them.
[02/02/2023, 01:47:01] Alice Lafferty: For me it's been on cross-country train journeysü§î
[02/02/2023, 01:47:12] Alice Lafferty: Goodnight!
[02/02/2023, 01:47:56] Alex Regueiro: I'll have to ask you about those another time... good night.
[02/02/2023, 09:16:24] Alice Lafferty: This one is interesting. It reminds me of a problem in New Testament scholarship: if a miracle is by definition the most improbable of events, and a historian can establish only what probably happened in the past, a historian can never establish that a miracle happened.
[02/02/2023, 09:17:22] Alice Lafferty: I just have a couple more queries.
[02/02/2023, 09:17:46] Alice Lafferty: Mathematical structures in older theories are indeed preserved in newer ones - OK - how does that prove the ontological priority of structure?
[02/02/2023, 09:19:47] Alice Lafferty: It's certainly a good reason to believe that structure exists, but I don't see how it follows that structure is _all_ that exists. Maybe this will be addressed somewhere.
[02/02/2023, 09:23:24] Alice Lafferty: I think epistemic structural realism is going to prove more convincing (for me anyway).
[02/02/2023, 09:24:30] Alice Lafferty: 2) surely mathematical structures must be instantiated in something - what is that something?
[02/02/2023, 09:25:08] Alice Lafferty: Haven't read the others yet.
[02/02/2023, 09:26:14] Alice Lafferty: We don't particularly have to keep talking about philosophy because I do think I just embarrass myself (especially in front of your friend Izzy last night, on reflection).
[02/02/2023, 15:14:22] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[02/02/2023, 15:14:36] Alex Regueiro: Stay up through the night then? üôÇ
[02/02/2023, 15:17:10] Alex Regueiro: Interesting analogy. I'm going to have to refresh myself on that paper before I comment properly!
[02/02/2023, 15:18:14] Alex Regueiro: Good questions. I'll answer them properly when I get back... just about to head off to the gym.
[02/02/2023, 15:18:54] Alex Regueiro: I'm more than happy to, it's really interesting. Discussing philosophy with someone who's still working through their ideas (well, we should all be to some extent) is arguably the most interesting variety.
[02/02/2023, 15:23:54] Alex Regueiro: And you didn't embarrass yourself. Izzy can have a very direct - maybe even slightly confrontational - style of debate (and unnecessary hand bashing haha), but don't take it the wrong way. It's just his form of socratic dialogue. He does the same with everyone when he's up for a good debate. üòÄ
[02/02/2023, 15:25:16] Alex Regueiro: He definitely wouldn't have invited you to his party if he thought you were being stupid, and nor would Laurie have encouraged to come to future salons!
[02/02/2023, 23:28:10] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I just got around to having a proper glance at that paper... Yes, I think you're right, you have a nice theological analogy there. üôÇ I mean, I think it fits the definition of a base rate fallacy? Obviously there's no notion of "predictive success" here, but the base rate fallacy is quite general...
[02/02/2023, 23:28:57] Alex Regueiro: In fact, it cropped up during the pandemic and the false positive rates for COVID testing! I found one obscure article about it, but otherwise it got brushes under the rug...
[02/02/2023, 23:30:24] Alice Lafferty: Hello
[02/02/2023, 23:30:44] Alice Lafferty: I've been sort of sleeping biphasically
[02/02/2023, 23:31:13] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if the analogy is direct, it just reminded me!
[02/02/2023, 23:32:13] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I am just quite rejection sensitive I think.
[02/02/2023, 23:32:27] Alice Lafferty: How was the gym?
[02/02/2023, 23:32:28] Alex Regueiro: Right, this is where having done some abstract algebra definitely comes in handy. There are several related meanings of "structure" in mathematics, but in this case it formally refers to an "isomorphism class", I would say. An isomorphism is a one-to-one function (correspondence) between two "algebras" (confusingly themselves often called structures) that preserves all propositions about members of the algebra. I hope that roughly makes sense? It's hard to fully grasp without having studied abstract algebra or category theory though.
[02/02/2023, 23:33:40] Alex Regueiro: The issue is that any scientific theory is isomorphic with an infinitude of other theories where you just "rejig" what you call the objects and the relations between them
[02/02/2023, 23:34:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'd honestly need to think long and deep about it to decide whether it's technically a base rate fallacy... but I think it's at least very similar in that it discounts the prior distribution?
[02/02/2023, 23:34:49] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. A few examples were given, Ehrenfest‚Äôs theorem having a 'similar form' to f=ma (?)
[02/02/2023, 23:35:26] Alex Regueiro: Hah nice. I get the feeling we've discussed it before, but do you believe in the "two sleeps" theory that some historians have put forward? I mean, that the average person would get up in the middle of the night and do something for an hour or two then go back to bed.
[02/02/2023, 23:36:11] Alex Regueiro: That's fine. I totally get you. I mean, I was very rejection sensitive when I was young, certainly in my teens!
[02/02/2023, 23:36:15] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure you're right though. I have no way of verifying for myself whether 'structure' is preserved across theory change but I'll take your word for it ;)
[02/02/2023, 23:36:47] Alex Regueiro: Not bad thanks. Can't say I ever really enjoy it but I do it to keep halfway fit, and it was tolerable, so no complaints. üòâ
[02/02/2023, 23:37:06] Alice Lafferty: I have seen this before, but I think if it was common it would be more widely discussed?
[02/02/2023, 23:37:08] Alex Regueiro: Haha I'm honoured by the trust you place in me.
[02/02/2023, 23:37:36] Alex Regueiro: I get the feeling you might have said this previously too... honestly can't quite recall. I agree with you though. Seems a little fanciful.
[02/02/2023, 23:37:36] Alice Lafferty: It doesn't really make sense given our sleep-wake cycles are regulated by daylight exposure.
[02/02/2023, 23:37:48] Alex Regueiro: Right. There's just no adaptive reason for it.
[02/02/2023, 23:38:05] Alice Lafferty: Do you do cardio or weights or both?
[02/02/2023, 23:38:58] Alex Regueiro: Also, I give some examples in the paper of mine (the one on Schurz's theory), but I'm quite cursory in my discussion of it... the cited papers go into more detail. Ladyman's and another, as I recall.
[02/02/2023, 23:39:56] Alex Regueiro: Strength training. (Not much with freeweights, but various exercises and machines for upper body and core strength.)
[02/02/2023, 23:40:10] Alex Regueiro: I figure tennis takes care of the cardio... in theory!
[02/02/2023, 23:40:17] Alex Regueiro: Plus the odd walk.
[02/02/2023, 23:40:51] Alice Lafferty: Even so why does that entail that structure is the only thing that exists?
[02/02/2023, 23:41:37] Alice Lafferty: What if structure is just particularly highly detectable, I mean
[02/02/2023, 23:42:22] Alice Lafferty: * not a refutation of structural realism per se, just querying the eliminative stance towards entities/anything else.
[02/02/2023, 23:42:39] Alice Lafferty: Possible I didn't read the papers closely enough though
[02/02/2023, 23:43:16] Alice Lafferty: Yes, much more fun that staring at a wall on a treadmill too,
[02/02/2023, 23:44:07] Alice Lafferty: This is why a more limited form like ESR, seems to be better supported. I don't know though!
[02/02/2023, 23:44:14] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's a good one. The exact nature and mechanics of the "quantum to classical transition" is an active area of research in foundational physics / philosophy of physics, however. So we haven't quite worked out what the homomorphism is from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics yet. We kind of take it for granted it exists! For various reasons, though mainly experimental. It's actually a fascinating question which I did my first essay at Bristol on.
[02/02/2023, 23:44:58] Alex Regueiro: Aha! Only if you're a post rem or in re structuralist. üòâ
[02/02/2023, 23:45:31] Alex Regueiro: They can always be instantiated in principle, of course, but for ante rem structuralists, it's a secondary matter, if you get me.
[02/02/2023, 23:45:54] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, I had understood that quantum and classical mechanics hadn't been reconciled yet. What was your paper on specifically?
[02/02/2023, 23:46:02] Alex Regueiro: Did you ready Ladyman's original paper where he sets out the difference between OSR and ESR? (He was the one to do this.) I presume so, since you're talking about ESR.
[02/02/2023, 23:46:07] Alex Regueiro: He kind of considers ESR a cop-out hah
[02/02/2023, 23:46:17] Alex Regueiro: He made this quite clear in seminars too!
[02/02/2023, 23:46:55] Alex Regueiro: Well if the entities and laws themselves are arbitrary to some extent (up to ismorphism), then how can we say they're real in and of themselves?
[02/02/2023, 23:47:04] Alice Lafferty: I don't remember who the author was now I admit. Could have been
[02/02/2023, 23:47:18] Alex Regueiro: Indeed! I seem to have chronically awful stamina anyway, so that would be masochism at two levels.
[02/02/2023, 23:47:50] Alice Lafferty: But even a platonist would say that forms are imperfectly instantiated in ""matter"", what is the equivalent here?
[02/02/2023, 23:49:26] Alice Lafferty: I had thought that ESR simply stated that we have some access to knowledge of the form/'structure' of the natural world, and not really commenting further.
[02/02/2023, 23:49:32] Alex Regueiro: "Quantum realism and emergent classicality"
Specifically the works of Zurek (influential Polish scholar who's worked in the foundations of physics for ages) and the role of decoherence in QM (a phenomenon he first described as I recall). He has wacky-named but actually very sensible ideas like "quantum darwinism".
[02/02/2023, 23:49:52] Alex Regueiro: Right. We instantiate these structures through our mathematics and language.
[02/02/2023, 23:49:59] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, we construct them menetally.
[02/02/2023, 23:52:54] Alice Lafferty: Just because we don't have a historical scientific continuity of entities in the way we do with structure, why does that mean entities must be arbitrary?

‚Äé[02/02/2023, 23:53:35] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[02/02/2023, 23:55:49] Alex Regueiro: The comment about Ramsey sentences in the second slide is a partial answer to that. Entities aren't totally arbitrary (they and their relations are still constrained by the structure), but we have many different choices for them, equally good. And we can semantically change the intension of the entities, and the cardinality of the set of entities, and have equally good theories... so quite fundamental things!
[02/02/2023, 23:55:52] Alice Lafferty: Ha, I think the second point on this slide is self-defeating... a purely epistemic modification _can't_ solve an ontological problem.
[02/02/2023, 23:56:50] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's exactly what he's saying. He's not saying ESR is wrong, but that it doesn't really help us with the original problem (which is the question of what we consider to be "real" in the natural world).
[02/02/2023, 23:57:53] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Maybe this is the part I'm missing.
[02/02/2023, 23:58:08] Alice Lafferty: So it's not possible that our knowledge of entities/laws is just incomplete?
[02/02/2023, 23:59:26] Alice Lafferty: I can see the argument for structural realism but not for the _unique_ ontological claim I guess..
[02/02/2023, 23:59:47] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I will have to read more about Ramsey sentences, I haven't come across those before.
[02/02/2023, 23:59:52] Alex Regueiro: BTW, there's a pretty good response to that NMA base rate fallacy paper. Actually two. But both pretty technical in terms of their employment of probability theory. But good papers written by notable philosophers of science.
[03/02/2023, 00:00:13] Alice Lafferty: Yes I saw but didn't read!
[03/02/2023, 00:00:16] Alex Regueiro: Also, this is a nice example of the base rate fallacy in view of what I said about the covid testing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy#Example_1:_Disease (not saying it applies verbatim, but food for thought)
[03/02/2023, 00:00:31] Alex Regueiro: Oh did I send you that one too? I'm not sure if I even meant to hah.
[03/02/2023, 00:00:46] Alex Regueiro: Okay, back to what we were just discussing...
[03/02/2023, 00:00:47] Alice Lafferty: I think that the Jesus miracle problem may actually be more similar to the black raven paradox, than the base rate fallacy.
[03/02/2023, 00:01:11] Alice Lafferty: But also solved with Bayesian probability.
[03/02/2023, 00:02:11] Alex Regueiro: Not really. Because there are always equally good alternative theories (in terms of empirical predictive success), as this statement about Ramsey sentences alludes to. I think there may even be an infinitude of such alternative theories, though the vast majority of them will be completely incomprehensible and practically useless to humans, even if formally correct and equivalent!
[03/02/2023, 00:02:31] Alice Lafferty: Did you mean by this that you are an ante-rem structuralist?
[03/02/2023, 00:02:56] Alex Regueiro: Nor had I before that degree. They're an interesting concept though. They were embraced with zeal by the logical positivists, as I understand!
[03/02/2023, 00:03:47] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, that's a nice paradox. We dwelt on that a little in the course on scientific epistemology & methodology.
[03/02/2023, 00:03:57] Alex Regueiro: I actually forgot what I concluded from it at the time hah
[03/02/2023, 00:04:26] Alex Regueiro: Yes, as you know. Though I think I have you to thank for making me realise I'm actually an ante rem structuralist, of sorts.
[03/02/2023, 00:05:52] Alex Regueiro: FYI the main problem with Ramsey sentences is that observations are inherently theory-laden, but that's a whole other can of worms...
[03/02/2023, 00:06:05] Alice Lafferty: So for practical purposes, entities are interchangeable to some degree but forms or structure are not?
[03/02/2023, 00:06:13] Alex Regueiro: Exactly
[03/02/2023, 00:06:38] Alex Regueiro: It's in this sense OSR adherents call structures "real"
[03/02/2023, 00:06:48] Alex Regueiro: or "objective"
[03/02/2023, 00:07:08] Alice Lafferty: Are entities like epiphenomena of structure then
[03/02/2023, 00:07:34] Alice Lafferty: I think the example used was electrons.
[03/02/2023, 00:07:50] Alex Regueiro: Hmm
[03/02/2023, 00:08:18] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure I'd describe them as "epiphenomena". They (along with "rules" or "laws") are what instantiate and make concrete structure, that's all.
[03/02/2023, 00:08:46] Alex Regueiro: Well, "that's all" may be unfair... but that's the substance of it!
[03/02/2023, 00:10:55] Alice Lafferty: But if structure is the most fundamental thing doesn't everything else have to be secondary to it
[03/02/2023, 00:11:32] Alice Lafferty: For X to instantiate Y, implies that X actually exists independently?
[03/02/2023, 00:11:51] Alice Lafferty: Like the 'form of an apple' is instantiated in pre-existing matter.
[03/02/2023, 00:16:02] Alice Lafferty: * sorry, implies that Y could actually pre-exist in some kind of uninstantiated form, like a platonic realm.
[03/02/2023, 00:16:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I suppose it depends what you mean by "epiphenomenon"... Caling them secondary in some sense would be fair though.
[03/02/2023, 00:20:07] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I'm literally just playing devil's advocate
[03/02/2023, 00:20:22] Alex Regueiro: Hah it's all good. I often like to do the same!
[03/02/2023, 00:20:40] Alex Regueiro: I even did a little at the salon last night
[03/02/2023, 00:21:26] Alex Regueiro: Oh I was referring to the raven paradox here. I should have been clearer.
[03/02/2023, 00:21:33] Alex Regueiro: But your point stands regardless...
[03/02/2023, 00:22:29] Alex Regueiro: This very much depends on what sort of structuralist you are.
[03/02/2023, 00:22:31] Alice Lafferty: Oh right
[03/02/2023, 00:22:53] Alice Lafferty: Isn't this what ante rem structuralism is?
[03/02/2023, 00:22:57] Alex Regueiro: Ante rem structuralism is more in line with platonic idealism than nominalism here!
[03/02/2023, 00:23:13] Alice Lafferty: Exactly!
[03/02/2023, 00:23:15] Alex Regueiro: Snap
[03/02/2023, 00:23:16] Alex Regueiro: heh
[03/02/2023, 00:24:01] Alice Lafferty: I have kind of always considered myself a nominalist so it's tricky.
[03/02/2023, 00:24:31] Alex Regueiro: I used to be a die-hard nominalist, as a matter of fact... I suppose you could say I'm still an 'epistemic' nominalist whereas a 'metaphysical' platonist, if you get my drift!
[03/02/2023, 00:25:07] Alex Regueiro: Double snap
[03/02/2023, 00:25:16] Alice Lafferty: Very interesting how that has turned out!
[03/02/2023, 00:25:42] Alice Lafferty: I won't press you for any more details about the nature of this platonic structure realm..
[03/02/2023, 00:25:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. It's funny how some of my philosophical views have shifted radically and other things have remained static...
[03/02/2023, 00:26:13] Alex Regueiro: Even past the supposed age of mental calcification. ü§î
[03/02/2023, 00:26:52] Alice Lafferty: Do you consider these to be 'brute facts' in some way.
[03/02/2023, 00:26:54] Alex Regueiro: It's all murk! Murky structures ‚Äì epistemically inaccessible but ontologically real.
[03/02/2023, 00:27:04] Alex Regueiro: What exactly?
[03/02/2023, 00:27:36] Alice Lafferty: Platonic structures. That some forms just repeat throughout the physical world... and that's that.
[03/02/2023, 00:27:55] Alex Regueiro: Oh no. Not brute facts at all. Totally a posteriori.
[03/02/2023, 00:27:57] Alice Lafferty: Oh there is hope for me yet...!
[03/02/2023, 00:28:07] Alex Regueiro: That's where I think this diverges sharply from (traditional) platonism.
[03/02/2023, 00:29:04] Alex Regueiro: There is! When did St Augustine have his massive revelation? Surely well after the age of 20!
[03/02/2023, 00:29:42] Alex Regueiro: Ours are just philosohpical
[03/02/2023, 00:30:09] Alice Lafferty: Doesn't that get you an infinite causal chain?
[03/02/2023, 00:30:09] Alex Regueiro: And even if you don't have a transformative experience, the journey will be a lot of fun. üòÄ
[03/02/2023, 00:30:16] Alex Regueiro: How so?
[03/02/2023, 00:30:58] Alex Regueiro: Oh incidentally, on the subject of causality in modern fundamental physics, I did think of this last night after we said goodbye. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_sets
[03/02/2023, 00:31:17] Alex Regueiro: Don't ask me to explain it in detail though, because I'm genuinely ignorant
[03/02/2023, 00:31:21] Alice Lafferty: The revelations (üôÑ) apparently came to him unceasingly for his entire life... very 'gifted' individual.
[03/02/2023, 00:31:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh really? Hah
[03/02/2023, 00:31:49] Alice Lafferty: What is the causal explanation for the existence of structures.
[03/02/2023, 00:31:51] Alex Regueiro: Yes, "gifted" is a whopper of a euphemism in his case...
[03/02/2023, 00:32:29] Alex Regueiro: Or you can have visions like that medieval German nun... Hildegard, was it?
[03/02/2023, 00:32:47] Alex Regueiro: And become famous writing copiously about them
[03/02/2023, 00:33:02] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I understand this.
[03/02/2023, 00:33:06] Alice Lafferty: What is a bijective map?
[03/02/2023, 00:33:52] Alex Regueiro: It's an inference from the "resistance" of structures to theory change (as opposed to entity realism). That is, a series of homomorphisms for one "good" theory to its successor.
[03/02/2023, 00:34:10] Alex Regueiro: homomorphism = structure-preserving map/function, in a well-defined mathematical sense
[03/02/2023, 00:34:31] Alice Lafferty: Obviously traditional platonists think everything emanates from The One, and The One is about a brute a fact as you can get.
[03/02/2023, 00:34:32] Alex Regueiro: Easiest way to explain is this is probably as a one-to-one map/correspondence between two sets.
[03/02/2023, 00:35:05] Alice Lafferty: Yep.. I consider these people to be charismatic artistic figures foremost and not really philosophers.
[03/02/2023, 00:35:22] Alex Regueiro: Well, neo-platonists, right? I don't think Plato himself or his students said anything about this. But yeah, I hate those sorts of baseless a priori assertions.
[03/02/2023, 00:35:23] Alice Lafferty: Same as Julian of Norwich and Teresa of Avila
[03/02/2023, 00:36:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes. So you have inferred that structures exist. Now mustn't you try and infer why they exist?
[03/02/2023, 00:36:18] Alex Regueiro: This seems fair. They're magnificent lifelong (or at least long-term) performers and curators of their own image and mystique.
[03/02/2023, 00:36:41] Alice Lafferty: But they were also right that there's no such thing as a sound epistemology.
[03/02/2023, 00:36:49] Alex Regueiro: Methinks within that question we move into your area of expertise!
[03/02/2023, 00:37:04] Alice Lafferty: Out of infinitism, circularity, dogma and brute facts, I think brute facts are the best.
[03/02/2023, 00:37:41] Alice Lafferty: Exactly. We still get them all the time
[03/02/2023, 00:38:11] Alice Lafferty: Ha maybe. So philosophers of science tend to refrain from asking these kinds of questions?
[03/02/2023, 00:40:22] Alice Lafferty: Excuse me for bringing in pop science üòî, but this is a similar question to why the (26?) fundamental physical constants are what they are.
[03/02/2023, 00:40:24] Alex Regueiro: Yep, they're just called other things these days. Cult leaders. Self-help gurus. Philanthropists. Celebrities!
[03/02/2023, 00:41:03] Alex Regueiro: i.e. Just somewhat narcissistic quacks, charlatans, and mountebanks at the end of the day!
[03/02/2023, 00:41:23] Alex Regueiro: Okay, that was good vent of cynicism... sorry
[03/02/2023, 00:42:11] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, I tend to agree. At least if you're not unreasonably attached to them, you can just call them "posits" or "axioms", and they become legitimate philosophy. üòâ
[03/02/2023, 00:42:31] Alice Lafferty: I think I've only ever met one person like this. Actually hallucinatorarily intelligent (and intelligence is quite hard to fake), incredibly compelling physical presence.
[03/02/2023, 00:42:46] Alex Regueiro: I would say so yeah. They're more existential. I can't say I don't care at all about them, but feels like a whole different subject.
[03/02/2023, 00:42:52] Alice Lafferty: Could have rooms of people hanging on his every word
[03/02/2023, 00:42:58] Alex Regueiro: Oh, tell me?
[03/02/2023, 00:43:18] Alex Regueiro: They're the most enthralling types at a human level, but also dangerous and worrying as hell.
[03/02/2023, 00:43:44] Alice Lafferty: Yep.. like Charles Mason
[03/02/2023, 00:44:34] Alice Lafferty: Is there are good reason why eg. the speed of light in a vacuum has the value it does?
[03/02/2023, 00:44:58] Alice Lafferty: * by reason, I simply mean another link in the causal chain, not a final reason.
[03/02/2023, 00:45:16] Alice Lafferty: By the way, I am even more confused by Zarina.
[03/02/2023, 00:49:22] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, the legendary fine-tuning problem! I'd say most physicists these days and in the past alike just accept the values of these constants as brute facts. (However many they say there are.) Foundational physicists don't necessarily like that, and they try to get them to "fall out of the equations", or be derived from other constants. But they accept them nonetheless.
[03/02/2023, 00:49:38] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. Or, to cut to the chase... Hitler.
[03/02/2023, 00:50:17] Alice Lafferty: Right
[03/02/2023, 00:51:03] Alice Lafferty: Ah interesting - how do these physical constants interact with your structure, or in fact are they themselves the structure?
[03/02/2023, 00:51:15] Alice Lafferty: Hah, just go straight there
[03/02/2023, 00:51:28] Alex Regueiro: Well, remember that units are arbitrary, so it's only the relations of the constants to other ones, but... no, I don't think most physicists could give you a proper answer to that, and the ones that can are considered very fringe, to be kind even! Although it's been put forward that the speed of light (think of it as the ultimate speed limit of the universe, really) has varied over time as has the gravitational constant G. And they've compensated for each other in some sense.
[03/02/2023, 00:51:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh how so?
[03/02/2023, 00:51:48] Alice Lafferty: Yes that's what I meant.
[03/02/2023, 00:52:02] Alex Regueiro: Good question. The relations between them are in some way part of the structure.
[03/02/2023, 00:52:59] Alice Lafferty: I have thought before that non-mathematically represented ratios might be fundamental...
[03/02/2023, 00:53:21] Alice Lafferty: I realise now this is similar to structuralism.
[03/02/2023, 00:53:30] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Sometimes it's ratios, sometimes it's more complex relations... but that's just generalising a bit.
[03/02/2023, 00:53:37] Alex Regueiro: Yeah!
‚Äé[03/02/2023, 00:54:04] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[03/02/2023, 00:54:28] Alex Regueiro: Haha.
[03/02/2023, 00:54:55] Alex Regueiro: Yeah she occasionally spams links to her stuff. Some of them are okay, some of them are just facile!
[03/02/2023, 00:55:01] Alice Lafferty: Sorry - I don't mean to talk behind her back. It's just very interesting... maybe I will have this out with her in the future.
[03/02/2023, 00:55:11] Alex Regueiro: So, err she's quite anti-feminist
[03/02/2023, 00:55:16] Alex Regueiro: While being pro woman's rights
[03/02/2023, 00:55:20] Alex Regueiro: She's explained this to me before
[03/02/2023, 00:55:44] Alex Regueiro: Basically she's what's not considered an old-fashioned social liberal in most ways. Though recently she may have started deviating from that even?
[03/02/2023, 00:55:50] Alice Lafferty: And also a leftist and into tarot..
[03/02/2023, 00:56:06] Alice Lafferty: At least it is clear she is not a herd thinker.
[03/02/2023, 00:56:28] Alice Lafferty: * er did I mean groupthinker?
[03/02/2023, 00:56:41] Alice Lafferty: She seems to cut across left and right shibboleths
[03/02/2023, 00:56:45] Alex Regueiro: I mean, she used to be a big proponent of polyamory. Still is to some extent. Still tries claiming baseless it's the default/natural arrangement for humans, despite a few of us (me included) reasoning through that claim with her, and presenting the scientific consensus to her.
[03/02/2023, 00:56:54] Alex Regueiro: Yes this is certainly true!
[03/02/2023, 00:57:17] Alex Regueiro: Definitely. Quite a few in our group do, but her possibly more so than most.
[03/02/2023, 00:58:04] Alice Lafferty: Polyamory yet women belong in the kitchen yet gender is real but so is astrology?ü§î
[03/02/2023, 00:58:16] Alice Lafferty: I wish I had got to speak to her a bit!
[03/02/2023, 00:58:23] Alex Regueiro: She still strongly supports abortion rights too, though more recently she's said (agreeing with me as I recall) that it shouldn't be use as an alternative post-hoc form of "contraception".
[03/02/2023, 00:58:36] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. She's a big of contradictions.
[03/02/2023, 00:59:08] Alex Regueiro: And a writer of romance novels. I haven't read any, but something tells me I probably don't want to.
[03/02/2023, 00:59:17] Alice Lafferty: And she is in a relationship with what appeared to be quite a right wing man, from the few things he said.
[03/02/2023, 00:59:23] Alex Regueiro: Not that I can stand the genre to begin with.
[03/02/2023, 00:59:31] Alice Lafferty: Haha!
[03/02/2023, 00:59:36] Alice Lafferty: I might have a peruse..
[03/02/2023, 01:00:04] Alex Regueiro: Oh really? I forget what exactly he said. He's fairly classical liberal with maybe a smattering of conservative elements, from what I can tell. I don't know him well, but seems like a fairly nice fellow.
[03/02/2023, 01:00:23] Alex Regueiro: Just don't get into economics with her. She has some very naive views there. And I say that as someone without any formal education in economics!
[03/02/2023, 01:00:28] Alice Lafferty: Yeah. Some people didn't really talk all that much (me included)
[03/02/2023, 01:00:44] Alice Lafferty: Oh right!
[03/02/2023, 01:00:53] Alex Regueiro: Our one little argument was on that subject in fact. Not even colonialism and imperialism (that was just a whole lot of eye-rolling)
[03/02/2023, 01:01:12] Alex Regueiro: And a brief attempt to set her straight on some facts of history before giving up haha
[03/02/2023, 01:01:42] Alex Regueiro: But please, don't interpret me as slagging her off. She may be a bag of contradictions, but she's an interesting person, and adds much-needed spice and fun to the salon. üòâ
[03/02/2023, 01:01:47] Alice Lafferty: Ah ok
[03/02/2023, 01:02:08] Alice Lafferty: I agree. She was friendly to me as well
[03/02/2023, 01:02:45] Alex Regueiro: I abhor talking behind peoples back too... but that's more about spreading nasty rumours or trying to turn someone against someone else, to me. You're someone who makes your own mind up about people anyway!
[03/02/2023, 01:02:55] Alex Regueiro: I've had some really nice convos with her too
[03/02/2023, 01:03:23] Alex Regueiro: Mainly as a group? But still.
[03/02/2023, 01:03:40] Alice Lafferty: Sorry it was me who brought her up. I didn't mean anything malicious, I was just interested!
[03/02/2023, 01:03:48] Alex Regueiro: Not at all
[03/02/2023, 01:04:40] Alice Lafferty: You've known her much longer than you've known me anyway so you're hardly going to be swayed by whatever my comments are.
[03/02/2023, 01:04:44] Alex Regueiro: She's a genuinely interesting and unique person. I don't mean that as a euphemism even. You may vehemently disagree with some of her views... that's often the case in our group generally. But it's most often a good experience. üòâ
[03/02/2023, 01:04:58] Alice Lafferty: That is the impression I've got too.
[03/02/2023, 01:07:00] Alice Lafferty: I didn't really speak to anyone else much besides Laurie and Izzy, but they all seemed basically nice.
[03/02/2023, 01:07:16] Alex Regueiro: Of course. And I was referring to the reverse. But honestly, no one who turned up yesterday is a bad egg or anything. Or, as Mr. Wilde would prefer to say, they are not dull!
[03/02/2023, 01:07:24] Alex Regueiro: Glad to hear
[03/02/2023, 01:07:27] Alex Regueiro: And Rush a little?
[03/02/2023, 01:07:47] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure if I got everyone's names
[03/02/2023, 01:08:12] Alex Regueiro: Some of them I consider friends. Laurie, Izzy, Caitlin, Summer, Rush.
[03/02/2023, 01:08:27] Alex Regueiro: Caitlin and Summer will hopefully be at the next one. I think you'd like them. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 01:08:37] Alex Regueiro: Jake and Tesh are great too. I've had some lovely convos with Jake in particular.
[03/02/2023, 01:08:48] Alice Lafferty: Ok great!
[03/02/2023, 01:09:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh and Stass is a really nice woman too.
[03/02/2023, 01:09:11] Alex Regueiro: (If you recall her)
[03/02/2023, 01:09:28] Alex Regueiro: Only natural. I'm certainly not one to judge on that count!
[03/02/2023, 01:09:38] Alice Lafferty: I liked Tesh for his comments made across the table but didn't get to speak to him! Jake is his partner?
[03/02/2023, 01:09:46] Alex Regueiro: Yep they're a couple
[03/02/2023, 01:09:51] Alex Regueiro: And I agree he made some nice comments
[03/02/2023, 01:10:09] Alice Lafferty: Is that short for Nastasja - butchered spelling again but you know
[03/02/2023, 01:10:24] Alice Lafferty: She also seemed nice, as did her boyfriend.
[03/02/2023, 01:10:28] Alex Regueiro: First time Jake came only 4 of us showed up... terrible turnout! Amazingly we didn't scare him off. Gratefully.
[03/02/2023, 01:10:35] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes exactly.
[03/02/2023, 01:10:52] Alex Regueiro: Took me ages to get that name straight me head too. I think it's a variant of Anastasia?
[03/02/2023, 01:11:24] Alice Lafferty: Ohh, that makes more sense. Not variant of Natasha
[03/02/2023, 01:11:27] Alice Lafferty: Is she Russian?
[03/02/2023, 01:11:37] Alex Regueiro: Kai polarises people, but as long as you don't take what he says in the passion of debate to heart, I think you'll find him a good guy. A bit of a conspiracy theorist but a solid chap hah.
[03/02/2023, 01:12:10] Alex Regueiro: Oh no. She's British, mixed English/Caribbean I think.
[03/02/2023, 01:12:42] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I thought it was some fancy pronunciation of Natasha until I heard it the third or fourth time ha
[03/02/2023, 01:12:46] Alice Lafferty: Just realised it's the same spelling as Nastassja Kinski right?
[03/02/2023, 01:12:56] Alice Lafferty: Probably where it comes from
[03/02/2023, 01:13:38] Alex Regueiro: Good point. I know almost nothing about her though
[03/02/2023, 01:13:48] Alex Regueiro: Haha, her Wikipedia page has "Not to be confused with Natasha Kaplinsky" at the top
[03/02/2023, 01:14:08] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure if I can justify my place there really, since nearly everyone seem to be professionally involved in journalism, politics etc.
[03/02/2023, 01:14:28] Alice Lafferty: But if it's a case of just wanting 'room meat', then I can help there
[03/02/2023, 01:14:48] Alice Lafferty: Me neither
[03/02/2023, 01:14:54] Alice Lafferty: :S
[03/02/2023, 01:15:24] Alice Lafferty: I know you aren't! But you also have an organisational role sometimes!
[03/02/2023, 01:15:31] Alex Regueiro: Oh Alice, that's definitely just the impostor syndrome speaking. You're intellectually more than capable of holding your own in that room, and making really interesting contributions. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 01:15:48] Alex Regueiro: God's honest truth
[03/02/2023, 01:16:02] Alex Regueiro: (read that in a Southern accent)
[03/02/2023, 01:16:07] Alice Lafferty: Ha obviously you are being kind!
[03/02/2023, 01:16:25] Alice Lafferty: Yee hawü§†
[03/02/2023, 01:17:54] Alice Lafferty: I realise that it is emotionally vampiric of me to always be requiring reassurance, so sorry. But I am getting a hold of it :)
[03/02/2023, 01:18:24] Alex Regueiro: Trust me, I'm not just buttering you up. Not that I can say I never do that, but with people I genuinely like, I find it much more natural and fruitful just to be candid.
[03/02/2023, 01:18:45] Alex Regueiro: Laurie when he began as salon host was just a graduate with no job experience. Keep that in mind. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 01:18:56] Alex Regueiro: Kai is a marketing freelancer, or something like that
[03/02/2023, 01:19:18] Alex Regueiro: Stass runs an analytics team for The Telegraph, but not really involved on the news side
[03/02/2023, 01:19:20] Alex Regueiro: Karina is a novelist
[03/02/2023, 01:19:23] Alex Regueiro: Sam... I forget
[03/02/2023, 01:19:29] Alex Regueiro: Rush is a civil cervant
[03/02/2023, 01:19:49] Alice Lafferty: Even though I couldn't engage in a proper conversation about the philosophical implications of abstract algebra...
[03/02/2023, 01:19:51] Alex Regueiro: Jake is a product designer / mechanical engineer
[03/02/2023, 01:19:56] Alex Regueiro: Tesh is a game designer
[03/02/2023, 01:20:26] Alice Lafferty: Civil cervant
[03/02/2023, 01:20:26] Alex Regueiro: I'm just telling you these things so you can see what a diverse bunch we are, and hardly all experts in politics or philosophy (or love I daresay!)
[03/02/2023, 01:20:37] Alex Regueiro: Dear god... that's a real Alexism
[03/02/2023, 01:20:48] Alice Lafferty: When Cervantes is domesticated?
[03/02/2023, 01:21:01] Alex Regueiro: I would blame the hour, but I'm not particularly tired. üòë
[03/02/2023, 01:21:07] Alex Regueiro: haha!
[03/02/2023, 01:21:15] Alice Lafferty: Haha! I do them an astonishing rate
[03/02/2023, 01:21:29] Alex Regueiro: I still haven't read Cervantes. Would love to read it in the original Spanish at some point.
[03/02/2023, 01:21:52] Alice Lafferty: That is interesting
[03/02/2023, 01:21:54] Alex Regueiro: This is the true reason we're friends, you know
[03/02/2023, 01:22:08] Alice Lafferty: Me neither
[03/02/2023, 01:22:23] Alex Regueiro: Mutual sympathy for vaguely amusing linguistic slips.
[03/02/2023, 01:22:54] Alice Lafferty: I don't know what the relationship between modern spanish and 16th century spanish is
[03/02/2023, 01:23:06] Alice Lafferty: Similar to modern and early modern English I guess?
[03/02/2023, 01:23:21] Alice Lafferty: Exactlyüòâ
[03/02/2023, 01:23:52] Alice Lafferty: Thank you, I appreciate it. You can add me to the list: totally and completely unemployedüòÉ
[03/02/2023, 01:25:10] Alex Regueiro: Hah, frankly I'm probably the only one that could (or at least would want to) talk about such things, in this group! Well, Izzy could a bit maybe, but his background is more in straight physics and philosophy, not pure mathematics. Not blowing my own trumpet here, just saying we all have different proficiencies and predilections. Chalk and cheese.üòâ
[03/02/2023, 01:25:56] Alex Regueiro: And we love it! Or at least I do. Means you have time for great 'distractions' like this salon.
[03/02/2023, 01:25:58] Alice Lafferty: I suppose so. But you have other people you can bounce this kind of stuff of right?
[03/02/2023, 01:26:37] Alex Regueiro: I was going to say "unemployABLE, even" but that's just a cheap jibe at your theological past heh
[03/02/2023, 01:26:38] Alice Lafferty: I was just about to say it's impressive that these people work basically 9-5s and still have time to do FSC stuff.
[03/02/2023, 01:26:54] Alice Lafferty: Again true
[03/02/2023, 01:27:34] Alex Regueiro: Good question. I've looked into old forms of Spanish a little, and the main differences seem to be spelling (much less standardised back then, like English), a few consistent sound changes, and use of the future subjunctive. Not too bad!
[03/02/2023, 01:28:32] Alice Lafferty: Well, good luck! I can read the simpleton modern english translation alongside if you like.
[03/02/2023, 01:28:45] Alex Regueiro: Laurie was properly researching/planning and hosting every salon (every two/three weeks) before he started interning at Spiked, and got a girlfriend around the same time. He sort of fell of the cliff at that point hah. Understandably. I and then a few others helped pick up the slack. He'll still host the odd salon or two I think.
[03/02/2023, 01:29:14] Alex Regueiro: That would be fun! I'll let you know when I finally summon the courage to buy an original Spanish copy.
[03/02/2023, 01:29:40] Alice Lafferty: Wow yeah, that's fair enough.
[03/02/2023, 01:29:55] Alex Regueiro: At various points in the past yes... mainly when I've been at uni. And with the friends I've kept from uni to an extent, even though so many of them have gone back to their home countries or moved halfway around the world.
[03/02/2023, 01:30:41] Alice Lafferty: If there's any admin stuff that needs doing and you're busy you can pass it onto me if you like.
[03/02/2023, 01:31:22] Alice Lafferty: Although it's probably more stuff like researching discussion topics which others wouldn't feel so comfortable with me doing.
[03/02/2023, 01:31:42] Alice Lafferty: Bless the telephone..
[03/02/2023, 01:31:56] Alex Regueiro: That's really kind of you to say. I'll let you know, but I don't want to get in a habit of offloading things to you on a whim, that would be very inconsiderate. Equally, for the next salon I host, I'll definitely want to ask you for your opinion on the readings I'm considering, or recommendations!
[03/02/2023, 01:33:03] Alice Lafferty: It wouldn't, I'm really not busy - at all. Otherwise I just spend too much time on twitter anyway.
[03/02/2023, 01:33:08] Alice Lafferty: If you think of anything
[03/02/2023, 01:33:23] Alice Lafferty: Who'll be hosting the next one?
[03/02/2023, 01:34:00] Alex Regueiro: Mainly for your sake you'll want to just come to the salons a handful of times so you can settle in socially and get a feel for everything. But I'm confident Laurie would have no problem with you hosting one at some point this year! Some people were even sceptical about Zarina, but in the end Laurie and I lent her a hand and helped with management, and it all went rather well I thought. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 01:34:49] Alex Regueiro: I was just mentioning this to Laurie last night actually. Confirmed with Jake today, he should be up with it. He was telling me about his ideas at the Christmas party a month ago so...
[03/02/2023, 01:35:32] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah that might come across as presumptuous of me! I meant more that I can support others in hosting, whatever the kind of duties are.
[03/02/2023, 01:35:47] Alice Lafferty: Ah right, what's the topic going to be?
[03/02/2023, 01:35:52] Alex Regueiro: Hah fair. Still better than ghastly TikTok though, which is what way too many people your age (and older) fritter your time away doing. üë¥
[03/02/2023, 01:35:53] Alex Regueiro: (As long as you're not tweeting.)
[03/02/2023, 01:36:24] Alex Regueiro: You'd be more than welcome to host it yourself once you feel comfortable, a few months down the line. But yes, that works nicely too!
[03/02/2023, 01:37:18] Alice Lafferty: Ha yeah a little source of superiority for me, even though realistically it's like the difference between having your brain fried or saut√©d :)
[03/02/2023, 01:37:52] Alex Regueiro: Not sure. He threw around a few ideas. I'll let you know when he decides. Reminds me though, I need to book the room again, well in advance! I seem to be the regular room booker these days.
[03/02/2023, 01:38:25] Alex Regueiro: Haha I won't argue that simile.
[03/02/2023, 01:38:41] Alex Regueiro: I occasionally check news on Twitter, but god help me if I get sucked into the replies...
[03/02/2023, 01:38:44] Alice Lafferty: Well, stuff like this is just admin. Although I'd assumed it would fall to the host to carry out
[03/02/2023, 01:39:17] Alex Regueiro: I was helping Laurie with admin before I hosted one or even got more deeply involved in organisation.
[03/02/2023, 01:39:26] Alice Lafferty: Ok, maybe I will prepare some thoughts a bit better.
[03/02/2023, 01:39:59] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Well, just let me know if there's anything I can doüëç
[03/02/2023, 01:40:05] Alex Regueiro: For whatever strange reason he chose to entrust me with these things when he was a little under the cosh... Strange, because I've always considered myself a little unreliable organisationally! I mean, my timekeeping is awful.
[03/02/2023, 01:40:27] Alex Regueiro: Hmm?
[03/02/2023, 01:41:21] Alice Lafferty: The best organisers are actually just the best delegators...
[03/02/2023, 01:41:55] Alice Lafferty: They've all run pretty smoothly so far though, including the christmas party. So it can't be too bad!
[03/02/2023, 01:41:59] Alex Regueiro: Oh and he already told me after he thinks you're really nice and good person to have at the salon. In case it wasn't clear in my reply earlier today!
[03/02/2023, 01:42:23] Alex Regueiro: This is true! The micromanagers may seem like they're in command on the surface, but in fact...
[03/02/2023, 01:42:45] Alex Regueiro: I think this has been said about some Roman emperors, like Marcus Aurelius and Trajan?
[03/02/2023, 01:42:57] Alex Regueiro: Oh, but you don't know what happened there. üòâ
[03/02/2023, 01:43:11] Alex Regueiro: I'm kidding. It all went surprisingly well.
[03/02/2023, 01:43:23] Alice Lafferty: If the discussion topic is say, the Ukraine war, I will come armed with munition statistics and piercing geopolitical insight etc.
[03/02/2023, 01:43:31] Alex Regueiro: Oh right
[03/02/2023, 01:43:32] Alex Regueiro: yes!
[03/02/2023, 01:43:54] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, but that was the pub manager being annoying right?
[03/02/2023, 01:44:12] Alice Lafferty: Oh, that's nice to hear! Even though I didn't speak a whole lot.
[03/02/2023, 01:44:25] Alex Regueiro: I expect nothing less, knowing you. You tried to with yesterday's salon even, which was wonderful, though I didn't want you to waste too much time on it. Anyway we almost always post the reading sheet a few days or a week in advance.
[03/02/2023, 01:45:25] Alice Lafferty: It's good for me to get positive social feedback. I haven't been in that sort of environment for over a year.
[03/02/2023, 01:45:28] Alex Regueiro: Well, he's a friend, so he might have just been acting polite... except no, he was honest, since I know his personality!
[03/02/2023, 01:45:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, since you were living in Cambridge right?
[03/02/2023, 01:45:56] Alice Lafferty: Goodüëç
[03/02/2023, 01:46:17] Alex Regueiro: A little. He was both helpful and cheeky in equal measures. Thankfully that's all long-since sorted though. I didn't lose any money. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 01:46:22] Alice Lafferty: He's an interesting guy too.. he has some kind of far-away-ness about him.
[03/02/2023, 01:46:26] Alice Lafferty: Not in a bad way at all.
[03/02/2023, 01:46:35] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I know exactly what you mean!
[03/02/2023, 01:46:39] Alice Lafferty: And I liked his reading of the poem.
[03/02/2023, 01:46:40] Alex Regueiro: A still-waters-run-deep type.
[03/02/2023, 01:47:19] Alex Regueiro: Not particularly outgoing or authoritative in style, but a quietly good leader, and an intelligent observer. I think that's fair?
[03/02/2023, 01:47:21] Alice Lafferty: Yep, and the feedback there was very negative.
[03/02/2023, 01:47:45] Alice Lafferty: Yes, the comments he did make were some of the best of the evening I thought.
[03/02/2023, 01:48:23] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Impassioned. He always takes real pleasure in his reading, I've seen at lots of salons. Especially since he chose that poem! (We chatted with each other about that, and suggested Zarina alter something. Her previous choice for the short first reading was fine, just a bit dry.)
[03/02/2023, 01:48:33] Alex Regueiro: You can tell he's a real Romantic right? Keats fan üòâ
[03/02/2023, 01:49:03] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, it would have been interesting if he had spoken more to that I guess.
[03/02/2023, 01:49:26] Alice Lafferty: What was that?
[03/02/2023, 01:49:30] Alex Regueiro: Yep. I very much agreed with him. I think they very much reflect what we said to each other privately when discussing the topic, after Zarina initially presented it to us.
[03/02/2023, 01:49:49] Alex Regueiro: He never speaks very much, but he usually chooses his words carefully.
[03/02/2023, 01:50:06] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean?
[03/02/2023, 01:50:18] Alice Lafferty: Is he an arts graduate?
[03/02/2023, 01:50:35] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[03/02/2023, 01:50:49] Alex Regueiro: PPE (King's), then a master's (Amsterdam) in... politics?
[03/02/2023, 01:51:00] Alex Regueiro: Definitely more of a humanities type though.
[03/02/2023, 01:51:23] Alex Regueiro: Ex hardcore liberal, now hardcore neo-conservative/traditionalist haha.
[03/02/2023, 01:51:49] Alice Lafferty: Carefully avoid throwing myself a pity party here, but my social entreaties were generally met with indifference of hostility.
[03/02/2023, 01:51:57] Alice Lafferty: Many such cases...
[03/02/2023, 01:52:11] Alice Lafferty: I read some of his Spiked articles actually
[03/02/2023, 01:53:09] Alex Regueiro: The previous reading? Oh, just some outline of what medieval chivalry was. But we thought it too uninspired and not-quite-romanticism, even if I very much saw where she was coming from. It served as a foil to the second part, just like the poem did.
[03/02/2023, 01:53:18] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes? Thoughts?
[03/02/2023, 01:53:53] Alex Regueiro: Sorry to hear. üôÅ When you say entreaties, you mean asking other people if they wanted to go out and do something together?
[03/02/2023, 01:54:24] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see. May have been useful in the sense that it would push back against the idea that romanticism was 'invented' in 1750.
[03/02/2023, 01:54:29] Alex Regueiro: You told me how that one date went, which was disappointing enough, but there's even less of an excuse to rebuff friendly overtures in a mean way.
[03/02/2023, 01:55:16] Alice Lafferty: Yes, or just trying to start conversations.
[03/02/2023, 01:55:17] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. In my attempt at summing-up my thoughts, I embraced the idea that it wasn't pulled out of thin air. Proto-romanticism, changing constitution of "romanticism" even since 1750, modern confusion, etc.
[03/02/2023, 01:55:26] Alice Lafferty: I put this down to my appearance though.
[03/02/2023, 01:56:12] Alex Regueiro: You didn't say anything about my comments, but I presume (hope) I didn't say something stupid or tiresome in your view, at least!
[03/02/2023, 01:56:40] Alice Lafferty: Potentially the demographic at the FSC salon being shifted heterodox, and slightly older means they are tolerant of physical unattractiveness.
[03/02/2023, 01:56:47] Alex Regueiro: That makes me a little sad. You're so fun/interesting to chat with.
[03/02/2023, 01:57:59] Alex Regueiro: Well, you're probably not wrong about the salon group, but I honestly thing it's irrelevant to them.
[03/02/2023, 01:58:34] Alice Lafferty: Oh sorry, I really didn't think to comment! I thought your contributions were the most relevant and interesting, alongside Luca and Laurie's (and I'm not just being flattering!)
[03/02/2023, 01:59:04] Alice Lafferty: I think it would be good if you took on the hosting role more often.
[03/02/2023, 02:00:29] Alex Regueiro: And no matter how many times you say it, you won't convince me you're physically unattractive! Sorry. That may not be what you want to hear, but I have to be push back against what I can't personally understand or agree with.üò§
[03/02/2023, 02:00:36] Alex Regueiro: Maybe I'm just very strange, but if so I'm happily strange!
[03/02/2023, 02:00:42] Alice Lafferty: I think you had already made your case about romanticism to me beforehand.
[03/02/2023, 02:01:08] Alex Regueiro: That's lovely of you to say, and no, I wasn't fishing for compliments... I said that half in jest. But still nice to hear it.
[03/02/2023, 02:01:22] Alice Lafferty: Haha! You are a statistical anomaly!
[03/02/2023, 02:01:40] Alex Regueiro: I concur that Laurie's and Luca's comments were insightful. Some of Tesh's too.
[03/02/2023, 02:02:02] Alex Regueiro: Maybe so... but the world needs statistical anomalies, you know, right?
[03/02/2023, 02:02:12] Alex Regueiro: In all sorts of ways! Well, not every way, but...
[03/02/2023, 02:02:27] Alice Lafferty: I mean it was clear that some people's comments were more well-aimed than others, which is fine.
[03/02/2023, 02:03:18] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Some topics suit some people better anyway. And we all have days we're more intellectually or socially in tune.
[03/02/2023, 02:03:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes! And it's good to have found a group that seems to to attract those on tail ends of certain bell curves.
[03/02/2023, 02:04:02] Alex Regueiro: Aaand some people are just plain dense or tedious. No one in the salon though, we hope üòâ
[03/02/2023, 02:04:33] Alice Lafferty: Definitely
[03/02/2023, 02:04:59] Alex Regueiro: Right! I'm at intersection of several tails of bell curves... height being the most obvious but far from the most profound.
[03/02/2023, 02:05:20] Alice Lafferty: I didn't think so. As much as I dislike being socially rejected, I actually do believe a certain amount of gatekeeping is important to the health of any community.
[03/02/2023, 02:05:31] Alex Regueiro: And so are you, I dare say. To your credit ha
[03/02/2023, 02:06:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah absolutely. It can be free speech without being a free for all or rejecting standards altogether. That's why we (mainly Laurie then) kicked out Paul a few months ago. I realise I still haven't told you the full story, but I will at some point...
[03/02/2023, 02:06:50] Alice Lafferty: The conspiracy theorist guy?
[03/02/2023, 02:06:54] Alex Regueiro: But he's the only one who's been actually barred. A few have come once and not again (for whatever reason), and all the rest has been positive.
[03/02/2023, 02:07:18] Alice Lafferty: Probably a good amount of self-selection going on.
[03/02/2023, 02:07:30] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Among other things. And Zarina's ex (kind of?) as we later found out! I'm not saying Sam is the best catch in the world, but man is he a big step up...
[03/02/2023, 02:07:42] Alex Regueiro: Yes that's exactly the word I had in mind
[03/02/2023, 02:07:44] Alice Lafferty: Ha!
[03/02/2023, 02:08:46] Alex Regueiro: The only issue was when a couple of people did that before I joined (even before Laurie joined, as he was the second permanent host)... and then left and ratted us out to the Grauniad!
[03/02/2023, 02:09:52] Alex Regueiro: I may have told you this? One of them was the head of the Free Speech Society at Bristol the year I was studying there. What a character. Actually not a bad guy on a personal level, but what he did with the salon was plain rotten. In fact it was about Free Speech Champions as a whole, the organisation Inaya founded, but yeah...
[03/02/2023, 02:09:54] Alice Lafferty: I can't think of others apart from intelligence? I don't think you have any other extreme personality traits or anything.
[03/02/2023, 02:10:34] Alice Lafferty: Yea I heard some murmuring about this... what do you mean 'ratted out' - you hadn't done anything wrong?
[03/02/2023, 02:10:48] Alice Lafferty: 'Group meets to discuss politics' - why is that even newsworthy?
[03/02/2023, 02:11:22] Alice Lafferty: Was it a transphobia allegation or something haha
[03/02/2023, 02:11:25] Alex Regueiro: I'll take that as a compliment! I'm not sure if I'm quite on the "tail end", but I'm way above average anxiety/neuroticism too. Maybe a few other harder-to-pin-down things too.
[03/02/2023, 02:11:49] Alex Regueiro: Amazingly Laurie didn't know about until yesterday, it seems. Even I found out about it months ago (from Caitlin)
[03/02/2023, 02:12:08] Alice Lafferty: Yes maybe for a male. Lots of life outcomes are downstream of intelligence too of course.
[03/02/2023, 02:12:33] Alex Regueiro: Like I said it was more about the Free Speech Champions as a whole. Sort of a multi-pronged attack. Apparently we didn't have enough time for wokeists in our group (shock horror), and we have loose ties with the FSU (run by Toby Young).
[03/02/2023, 02:13:01] Alex Regueiro: I mean, even "eccentricity" counts, then that too... although it can take many forms eh?
[03/02/2023, 02:13:13] Alice Lafferty: I was actually thinking about this too, I probably lean more average on most traits than I had liked to think. If my life outcomes have been a bit non-standard, that's probably due to exogenous factors.
[03/02/2023, 02:13:23] Alex Regueiro: Hah no. How they would have loved that. Or racism.
[03/02/2023, 02:13:51] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if eccentricity is just like resistance to social norms - so tied up with agreeableness?
[03/02/2023, 02:13:54] Alex Regueiro: Quite possibly. Several personal traits correlate strongly with (certain forms of) intelligence too.
[03/02/2023, 02:13:59] Alice Lafferty: Probably more to it than that actually
[03/02/2023, 02:14:34] Alex Regueiro: You're on the tail end of hair colour, intelligence, and maybe a few other things relative to your average woman. üòâ
[03/02/2023, 02:14:43] Alex Regueiro: But things to celebrate mainly!
[03/02/2023, 02:14:53] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see... interesting because racial and sexual minorities were if anything overrepresented in the group.
[03/02/2023, 02:15:07] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, that's probably part of it but not all yeah
[03/02/2023, 02:15:12] Alice Lafferty: I can see how the Toby Young connection is a like a bad smell.
[03/02/2023, 02:15:21] Alex Regueiro: Oh definitely. Not sure how it started out, but I noted that at one point too.
[03/02/2023, 02:15:35] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I can half understand it, but I still think the FSU is a noble-minded organisation.
[03/02/2023, 02:15:47] Alex Regueiro: Regardless of his individual quirks.
[03/02/2023, 02:15:53] Alex Regueiro: ...or foibles
[03/02/2023, 02:16:49] Alice Lafferty: Hair colour, yes, although we can't say that hair colour has a normal distribution right? Intelligence I think is much closer to average.
[03/02/2023, 02:17:03] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, I was going to say when you brought up the poem reading: I just read Elegy in a country churchyard for the first time a few days ago! I know, horrendous omission in my cultural appreciation as an Englishman...
[03/02/2023, 02:17:18] Alice Lafferty: Eh I've probably had to adopt intellectualism as a kind of compensatory strategy for the typical feminine ones being unavailable to me.
[03/02/2023, 02:17:45] Alex Regueiro: No, you may not have fulfilled all your potential intelligence-wise yet, but you're minimum two standard deviations away from the mean.
[03/02/2023, 02:18:18] Alice Lafferty: Ah nice, what did you think of it? Seems like Gray's one-hit wonder.
[03/02/2023, 02:19:17] Alex Regueiro: Insofar as you're a woman, I was thinking your introversion, your rationalist/empirical bent, and maybe some other traits (I can't name them) are pretty tail-end? I hope that doesn't sound misogynistic hah. I realise there's huge variation within both sexes on these traits still
[03/02/2023, 02:19:31] Alice Lafferty: I really don't think so!
[03/02/2023, 02:19:46] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. I enjoyed it more than I thought! Some of the language was a little convoluted/overwrought, but the tone and style and imagery were beautiful in parts.
[03/02/2023, 02:20:03] Alice Lafferty: Don't get me started on the difference between rationalism and empiricism..
[03/02/2023, 02:20:56] Alex Regueiro: Maybe I just have some sort of innate nostalgia for bucolic scenes of yesteryear though, and the idealisation of the stereotypical honest, hard-working yeoman type!
[03/02/2023, 02:21:45] Alex Regueiro: Oh of course. We've already sort of been there. I grouped both together in a very casual way though, in opposition to emotionalism or capriciousness, if you get me?
[03/02/2023, 02:21:50] Alice Lafferty: I don't know to what extent these traits are inherent anyway, or whether I have sort of cultivated them defensively. Dispositions are largely immutable I think, but you can control which ones you express.
[03/02/2023, 02:22:04] Alice Lafferty: You would like Thomas Hardy then I think!
[03/02/2023, 02:22:16] Alex Regueiro: This is true. Though some take more effort to repress or sublimate than others!
[03/02/2023, 02:22:42] Alice Lafferty: Yes sorry I was just being pedantic
[03/02/2023, 02:22:47] Alex Regueiro: Yes probably. I only realised when reading that poem that he took the title for his famous novel from it haha
[03/02/2023, 02:23:03] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure that's been a UC question before though
[03/02/2023, 02:23:37] Alice Lafferty: He is the ne plus ultra English bucolicism.
[03/02/2023, 02:23:43] Alice Lafferty: Not a word but hey
[03/02/2023, 02:24:25] Alice Lafferty: I think you would also really like A Shropshire Lad by Housman.
[03/02/2023, 02:24:41] Alex Regueiro: Just as well I didn't say you're at least one standard deviation above the mean on the attractiveness scale then! Oh shit, I just did. Okay, feel free to scoff now. üòâ
[03/02/2023, 02:25:12] Alex Regueiro: It's only right to grant poetic licence here, n'est-ce pas?
[03/02/2023, 02:26:15] Alice Lafferty: My academic career would have been quite different if that were the case.
[03/02/2023, 02:26:51] Alice Lafferty: We've already established that you're in no good place to rate attractiveness because you have totally mysterious tastes.
[03/02/2023, 02:26:55] Alex Regueiro: Haha, this isn't the 50s... women are dominant in many academic fields these days! And indeed more women go to university.
[03/02/2023, 02:27:26] Alice Lafferty: That's what I'm saying. Your IQ need only be average to go to university.
[03/02/2023, 02:27:57] Alex Regueiro: Clearly I have tail-end-of-the-bell-curve taste for looks. üòî
[03/02/2023, 02:27:58] Alice Lafferty: Particularly for a non-STEM degree.
[03/02/2023, 02:28:13] Alex Regueiro: Or perhaps that should be a smiley emoji, since it works in my favour really?
[03/02/2023, 02:28:24] Alice Lafferty: At a certain point it literally becomes a sexual targeting error!
[03/02/2023, 02:29:15] Alex Regueiro: Honestly I'm not quite sure where I get it from, given I grew up entirely in the city and suburbs. I'm fully aware of my over-idealisation. It must be some sort of ancestral memory, all those yeomen farmers I've descended from!
[03/02/2023, 02:29:22] Alex Regueiro: haha
[03/02/2023, 02:29:36] Alice Lafferty: It ought to. Being attracted to a group widely considered unattractive is like exploiting a market inefficiency of sorts...
[03/02/2023, 02:30:06] Alex Regueiro: Exactly hah
[03/02/2023, 02:30:24] Alice Lafferty: Well - that's exactly where you get it from. If you had grown up in the actual countryside you would be quickly disabused of the Merrie Englande notions.
[03/02/2023, 02:30:30] Alice Lafferty: Same is true for me by the way
[03/02/2023, 02:31:12] Alice Lafferty: I have a huge weakness for English sentimentalism.
[03/02/2023, 02:32:00] Alex Regueiro: It's funny, really, when I analyse myself on this... I would say I generally rate women as highly attractive that most people would consider at least somewhat attractive, if not very. Maybe I'm not quite inline, but I didn't realise my barometer was so (apparently) out of whack until I met you!
[03/02/2023, 02:32:09] Alice Lafferty: Hence churches, antiquated speech, trying to cling onto broadsheets which print court circulars and births and deaths etc.
[03/02/2023, 02:32:20] Alex Regueiro: Yes. At least many of them. I think I sort of already am, at an intellectual level, just not a visceral one...
[03/02/2023, 02:32:49] Alex Regueiro: Hah. Probably doesn't help I've actually read those broadsheets looking for names of ancestors...
[03/02/2023, 02:32:58] Alice Lafferty: You mean you think you are less sexually discriminating than the average man?
[03/02/2023, 02:33:06] Alex Regueiro: No
[03/02/2023, 02:33:07] Alex Regueiro: Not at all
[03/02/2023, 02:33:11] Alex Regueiro: In fact I know I'm more
[03/02/2023, 02:34:08] Alex Regueiro: And that's been a hindrance to me, among other things. A man can't afford to be that way unless he's like top few percentiles in terms of looks.
[03/02/2023, 02:34:22] Alice Lafferty: Really! I haven't done this. Did you find anything?
[03/02/2023, 02:35:00] Alice Lafferty: Oh sorry, I thought you said you rated women to be highly attractive when others would only rate them as moderately attractive, or something.
[03/02/2023, 02:35:01] Alex Regueiro: What did you think of that poem incidentally? I thought I was prompting you to share! But based on your general comments, surely it appeals to your taste at some level?
[03/02/2023, 02:35:04] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I misread
[03/02/2023, 02:36:00] Alex Regueiro: I could have been clearer. I was trying to say my scale broadly agrees with your average men, just not too closely. Everyone has certain shapes of faces or body forms they prefer; that varies considerably.
[03/02/2023, 02:36:20] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, yes I think it's very pretty...
[03/02/2023, 02:37:15] Alex Regueiro: Funnily enough a cousin of mine from Peterborough (3rd cousin of my mum I think?) reached out to me a few months ago, and was messaging me earlier today. I sent him some old newspaper clippings about our shared (English) ancestors, which were pretty interesting reads. Including his death notice.
[03/02/2023, 02:37:24] Alice Lafferty: I think that for example Wordsworth on Tintern Abbey is better in terms of romanticism.
[03/02/2023, 02:37:34] Alice Lafferty: I love Blake and Coleridge too .
[03/02/2023, 02:37:36] Alex Regueiro: (Someone has to do the praying emojis if you've lapsed...)
[03/02/2023, 02:38:27] Alex Regueiro: I've only had a light taste of them, but honestly they're much more my type of Romantic poets! Much less so Byron and Keats. Wordworth somewhere in-between.
[03/02/2023, 02:38:30] Alex Regueiro: Wordsworth*
[03/02/2023, 02:38:47] Alex Regueiro: Though more good than bad
[03/02/2023, 02:38:56] Alex Regueiro: Oh now I see you mentioned him heh
[03/02/2023, 02:38:57] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see - if you consider your tastes average in that sense, then what is the problem? (I don't think it does vary that considerably though. There is a high degree of agreement about what people find attractive).
[03/02/2023, 02:39:13] Alice Lafferty: Ha yeah, I basically cleaned my phone screen!
[03/02/2023, 02:39:26] Alice Lafferty: Actually dislike Byron yeah.
[03/02/2023, 02:39:32] Alex Regueiro: You remember what I said about "averageness" within populations, right? And I agree there's a high degree of objectiveness in many respects, but some people prefer ‚Äì at least subtly ‚Äì different facial types, for example.
[03/02/2023, 02:39:35] Alice Lafferty: Blake is great.
[03/02/2023, 02:39:55] Alex Regueiro: Agreed. Byron is the worst. Keats I'm not a fan of, but he's not wholly without redeeming qualities.
[03/02/2023, 02:40:15] Alex Regueiro: We should celebrate Ada Lovelace more than Byron. And I'm not remotely trying to be a feminist here!
[03/02/2023, 02:40:18] Alice Lafferty: Auguries of Innocence is one of my favourite poems ever.
[03/02/2023, 02:40:27] Alice Lafferty: Interesting that you are coming round to the poetry eh
[03/02/2023, 02:40:33] Alex Regueiro: I should read it! If I haven't already and forgotten it, I mean.
[03/02/2023, 02:41:18] Alex Regueiro: Little by little... I mean, it's not like I didn't like a few poems when I were your age, but I never invested much time into it. I think all the Carol Ann Duffy and other tripe I did for GCSE seriously jaundiced me.
[03/02/2023, 02:41:27] Alice Lafferty: Maybe men have individual preferences once baseline fertility cues have been satisfied.
[03/02/2023, 02:41:26] Alex Regueiro: Just at the point I was maturing emotionally, alas.
[03/02/2023, 02:42:04] Alice Lafferty: She always gets wheeled out on international woman's day or whatever... never quite got to the bottom of what she actually achieved though to be honest.
[03/02/2023, 02:42:09] Alex Regueiro: I don't think it's quite such simplistically goal-oriented evo psych as that. But something a bit more generalised, perhaps
[03/02/2023, 02:42:26] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I was only teasing you anyway!
[03/02/2023, 02:42:35] Alex Regueiro: Haha fair
[03/02/2023, 02:42:47] Alice Lafferty: Oh I am so annoyed about this - they've cut Larkin out of the syllabus.
[03/02/2023, 02:42:52] Alex Regueiro: You'd probably disapprove of the poems I used to like anyway. üòâ
[03/02/2023, 02:43:04] Alex Regueiro: Maybe still do. üëÄ
[03/02/2023, 02:43:05] Alice Lafferty: And introduced an instagram poet üòê
[03/02/2023, 02:43:11] Alex Regueiro: Oh that's so sad.
[03/02/2023, 02:43:37] Alex Regueiro: I wonder if it's just because he's white, male, and dead, or they found out about the hilarious rants in his private letters finally.
[03/02/2023, 02:44:03] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I did just remember men experience a high rate of paraphilia too. So not entirely fertility driven.
[03/02/2023, 02:44:11] Alice Lafferty: Such as?
[03/02/2023, 02:44:30] Alex Regueiro: üé£
[03/02/2023, 02:44:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I find 95% of those just freakish though...
[03/02/2023, 02:44:59] Alice Lafferty: Bit of both I think. And they wanted to make space for Rupi Kaur or whatever
[03/02/2023, 02:45:22] Alice Lafferty: I have to fish for the poems?
[03/02/2023, 02:45:33] Alex Regueiro: No, I'm saying you took the bait haha
[03/02/2023, 02:45:44] Alice Lafferty: What about the other 5% though ;)
[03/02/2023, 02:45:48] Alice Lafferty: KIDDING
[03/02/2023, 02:45:56] Alice Lafferty: Oh! I didn't get that at all duh sorry
[03/02/2023, 02:46:02] Alex Regueiro: I see. Well, Instagram poetry sums up a good portion of what's wrong with modern society/culture anyway...
[03/02/2023, 02:46:03] Alice Lafferty: Well are you going to tell me anyway?
[03/02/2023, 02:46:07] Alex Regueiro: haha
[03/02/2023, 02:46:26] Alex Regueiro: Oh err
[03/02/2023, 02:46:29] Alex Regueiro: If
[03/02/2023, 02:46:37] Alex Regueiro: partly because my granddad introduced me to it when I was young
[03/02/2023, 02:46:42] Alice Lafferty: Rudyard Kipling?
[03/02/2023, 02:46:45] Alex Regueiro: and I won a poetry reading contest for it!
[03/02/2023, 02:46:49] Alice Lafferty: Why would disapprove?
[03/02/2023, 02:46:57] Alice Lafferty: It's canonical.
[03/02/2023, 02:46:58] Alex Regueiro: (the peak of my poetical career, in primary school)
[03/02/2023, 02:47:01] Alex Regueiro: Too "basic"?
[03/02/2023, 02:47:03] Alice Lafferty: Haha really!
[03/02/2023, 02:47:05] Alex Regueiro: IT is. A good poem nonetheless
[03/02/2023, 02:47:08] Alex Regueiro: It is*
[03/02/2023, 02:47:14] Alice Lafferty: How old were you then?
[03/02/2023, 02:47:33] Alex Regueiro: Err, maybe 9 or 10?
[03/02/2023, 02:47:51] Alice Lafferty: I mean my taste is really basic... Larkin and Blake are like the widely anthologised poets in the language.
[03/02/2023, 02:48:03] Alice Lafferty: Aw
[03/02/2023, 02:48:26] Alex Regueiro: And you now know roughly how I looked then üòâ
[03/02/2023, 02:48:40] Alex Regueiro: Err, what else? A few poems by H P Lovercraft to be honest
[03/02/2023, 02:48:48] Alice Lafferty: Haha yeah exactly, I have a good mental image.
[03/02/2023, 02:48:55] Alex Regueiro: Hah. Not overly popular these days though... and Blake languished in obscurity for many decades I believe!
[03/02/2023, 02:49:02] Alice Lafferty: I did not even know he wrote poetry. Good?
[03/02/2023, 02:49:31] Alice Lafferty: This is just incidental but have you ever been to Chichester cathedral?
[03/02/2023, 02:49:48] Alex Regueiro: It's okay
[03/02/2023, 02:49:54] Alex Regueiro: Probably objectively nothing special
[03/02/2023, 02:49:59] Alex Regueiro: I just like the mood/aesthetic
[03/02/2023, 02:50:04] Alex Regueiro: And one of them was about cats hah
[03/02/2023, 02:50:09] Alice Lafferty: I'll read some
[03/02/2023, 02:50:13] Alice Lafferty: Ah yes...
[03/02/2023, 02:50:19] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure you've heard the name of his own cat...
[03/02/2023, 02:50:38] Alice Lafferty: Pretty much the first thing one learns about Lovecraft
[03/02/2023, 02:50:40] Alex Regueiro: Afraid not. I've been to quite a few but not that one. Is it special to you?
[03/02/2023, 02:50:46] Alex Regueiro: Quite
[03/02/2023, 02:50:54] Alex Regueiro: So, err, what else?
[03/02/2023, 02:50:58] Alex Regueiro: The Raven
[03/02/2023, 02:51:19] Alice Lafferty: No, you're going to want to kill me for saying this but Philip Larkin wrote a poem about a memorial there.
[03/02/2023, 02:51:29] Alex Regueiro: Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night
[03/02/2023, 02:51:41] Alex Regueiro: I know, basic
[03/02/2023, 02:51:44] Alice Lafferty: Nice!
[03/02/2023, 02:51:59] Alex Regueiro: Oh, a funerary monument? Didn't you already link me to that one?
[03/02/2023, 02:52:07] Alice Lafferty: This one is very affecting, yet I've never been able to get into any of Thomas' other stuff...
[03/02/2023, 02:52:18] Alice Lafferty: Probablyüòê
[03/02/2023, 02:52:22] Alice Lafferty: Sorry
[03/02/2023, 02:52:37] Alice Lafferty: An Arundel Tomb
[03/02/2023, 02:52:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I loved it üòÄ
[03/02/2023, 02:52:40] Alex Regueiro: That's the one
[03/02/2023, 02:52:53] Alice Lafferty: By the way it's not my favourite of his.
[03/02/2023, 02:53:07] Alice Lafferty: But I'd really like to see the tombstone that inspired it.
[03/02/2023, 02:53:13] Alex Regueiro: Oh, and The Goblin Market. Not for great literary quality, but the sheer irreverence among other things!
[03/02/2023, 02:53:20] Alex Regueiro: Same
[03/02/2023, 02:53:21] Alice Lafferty: Love that poem!
[03/02/2023, 02:53:36] Alice Lafferty: Literally know it of by heart
[03/02/2023, 02:53:40] Alice Lafferty: *off
[03/02/2023, 02:53:51] Alice Lafferty: I love In The Bleak Midwinter too!
[03/02/2023, 02:54:04] Alice Lafferty: Rossetti's 'back catalogue' is actually really good too.
[03/02/2023, 02:54:20] Alex Regueiro: Hah impressive
[03/02/2023, 02:54:41] Alex Regueiro: What do you make of the sexual imagery?
[03/02/2023, 02:54:59] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure if I've read it, but I've heard good things!
[03/02/2023, 02:55:16] Alex Regueiro: Christina again yes?
[03/02/2023, 02:55:26] Alice Lafferty: It for sure appealed to me as an adolescent.
[03/02/2023, 02:55:39] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I was exaggerating
[03/02/2023, 02:55:42] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[03/02/2023, 02:55:58] Alice Lafferty: Eh replied to wrong message.
[03/02/2023, 02:56:08] Alex Regueiro: Thought so
[03/02/2023, 02:56:59] Alice Lafferty: * I don't think Chichester itself is anything to write home about.
[03/02/2023, 02:57:06] Alex Regueiro: Yeah me too. Definitely read it at the right age hah
[03/02/2023, 02:57:18] Alice Lafferty: I'm looking for other things to do in that area to make a day of it.
[03/02/2023, 02:59:08] Alice Lafferty: Made into quite a famous hymn
[03/02/2023, 02:59:26] Alice Lafferty: Ofc so were many of Blake's poems.
[03/02/2023, 02:59:43] Alex Regueiro: Although if I may venture to say so, you do a jolly good job of keeping your sexuality under wraps! (We all have one...)
[03/02/2023, 02:59:45] Alex Regueiro: Yes
[03/02/2023, 02:59:51] Alex Regueiro: I'm maybe more familiar with it in hymn form
[03/02/2023, 03:00:24] Alex Regueiro: Honestly not sure what else is in the city. Maybe the South Downs is near?
[03/02/2023, 03:00:37] Alice Lafferty: What do you mean?
[03/02/2023, 03:00:58] Alice Lafferty: Doesn't everyone keep their sexuality under wraps in public?
[03/02/2023, 03:01:04] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I just meant to say, we all have that side of us, but some let it on more than others!
[03/02/2023, 03:01:08] Alex Regueiro: Like how they dress
[03/02/2023, 03:01:09] Alex Regueiro: and talk
[03/02/2023, 03:01:22] Alex Regueiro: And I am more or less the same as you in fact
[03/02/2023, 03:01:41] Alex Regueiro: It's kind of crass to be to open about it, for sure
[03/02/2023, 03:01:46] Alice Lafferty: I think it's just on the edge of the South Downs yeah. Not particularly helpful though as I was intending to take the train down there.
[03/02/2023, 03:02:17] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see. I think people would think me pathetic if I tried dressing promiscuously.
[03/02/2023, 03:02:27] Alice Lafferty: I mean, I've already told you how it goes down.
[03/02/2023, 03:02:39] Alice Lafferty: But yes I agree. I think it's simply not decent.
[03/02/2023, 03:02:47] Alice Lafferty: Haha I'm just kind of a prude!
[03/02/2023, 03:03:20] Alex Regueiro: (Sorry, I didn't mean that as a criticism in the slightest sense. Just that your little comment reveals how like other people you are, even if you do make an effort to dress/behave more on the demure side. Which I personally find becoming/appropriate for the most part. At least in public hah.)
[03/02/2023, 03:03:24] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[03/02/2023, 03:03:45] Alex Regueiro: There's always a tension though, isn't there?
[03/02/2023, 03:03:56] Alex Regueiro: Even in the "prudes" (which is too strong a word for you)
[03/02/2023, 03:03:57] Alice Lafferty: No I didn't think you did
[03/02/2023, 03:04:24] Alex Regueiro: Yeah true. It wouldn't be convenient if you did that.
[03/02/2023, 03:04:41] Alice Lafferty: I see. To be honest I feel uncomfortable when other people talk about sex in public.
[03/02/2023, 03:04:46] Alex Regueiro: Well if you find somewhere else to see, I could keep you company if you like? I mean, I'm kind of intrigued by the "Arundel Tomb" alone, but...
[03/02/2023, 03:04:50] Alice Lafferty: It's just embarrassing.
[03/02/2023, 03:05:02] Alice Lafferty: The Victorian hush hush attitude is kind of good in a way.
[03/02/2023, 03:05:04] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I hope the few bawdy jokes didn't at the salon didn't make you too uncomfortable
[03/02/2023, 03:05:13] Alex Regueiro: I used to be very much like that, and still am to a *certain* extent
[03/02/2023, 03:05:41] Alice Lafferty: No! It was completely fine.
[03/02/2023, 03:05:49] Alex Regueiro: There's some good evidence they were a bit freaky in private though, it seems!
[03/02/2023, 03:06:40] Alex Regueiro: Well, some of them.. Libertinism has often been an undercurrent in outwardly quasi-puritanical societies.
[03/02/2023, 03:06:54] Alice Lafferty: I honestly think there is an element of being afraid that should I be implicated in a sexual situation other people would be like... repulsed at the thought?
[03/02/2023, 03:06:58] Alice Lafferty: Ok!
[03/02/2023, 03:07:30] Alex Regueiro: I found Tesh's comment/anecdote slightly amusing at the same time as finding it sightly gross.
[03/02/2023, 03:07:37] Alice Lafferty: I was going to drag my parents but I don't think they showed genuine interest.
[03/02/2023, 03:07:42] Alex Regueiro: Oh
[03/02/2023, 03:08:08] Alex Regueiro: Well take your parents by all means, if they're up for it! You'd probably find it easier that way
[03/02/2023, 03:08:17] Alice Lafferty: Yes, I know there was a thriving prostitution and pornography trade in Victorian London (but hasn't there always been!)
[03/02/2023, 03:08:32] Alex Regueiro: Just saying if you'd like someone to keep you company, I can probably make myself available, and would probably enjoy it. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 03:08:51] Alex Regueiro: Well, not the photography thing! That was an early Victorian invention more or less ha
[03/02/2023, 03:09:04] Alex Regueiro: But point taken
[03/02/2023, 03:09:18] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly - it's not that they aren't funny, it's just that I don't know how to react. It was fine in a group setting.
[03/02/2023, 03:09:32] Alex Regueiro: Ah good
[03/02/2023, 03:09:51] Alex Regueiro: They become less embarrassing/awkward with time and age, trust me. I mean, up to a certain point.
[03/02/2023, 03:10:11] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Are you sure? I had originally planned for weekend after next but I guess we can go whenever?
[03/02/2023, 03:10:31] Alice Lafferty: Yeah.. they had all sorts of erotica before that though I think
[03/02/2023, 03:10:49] Alex Regueiro: But Zarina extending her arm to fist-bump Kai and saying "let's do it the black way" will never cease to make you cringe internally. I mean, very nearly die inside. üòÑ
[03/02/2023, 03:11:19] Alice Lafferty: What does that mean?
[03/02/2023, 03:11:20] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I said I wouldn't gossip! I just relate this because it made me laugh. I don't think less of her haha
[03/02/2023, 03:11:43] Alex Regueiro: I might be paraphrasing. But, you know, like black people should fist-bump while white people do handshakes or hugs.
[03/02/2023, 03:11:52] Alice Lafferty: Oh right
[03/02/2023, 03:12:01] Alex Regueiro: The 18th/19th?
[03/02/2023, 03:12:07] Alice Lafferty: I didn't catch that at the time.
[03/02/2023, 03:12:14] Alex Regueiro: Even funnier were Kai's and Rush's reactions haha
[03/02/2023, 03:12:36] Alex Regueiro: Well lucky you
[03/02/2023, 03:12:47] Alice Lafferty: There is some funny stuff produced there sometimes, like some of the 'white people can't dance/season their food'.
[03/02/2023, 03:12:54] Alice Lafferty: But sometimes it doesn't work.
[03/02/2023, 03:13:17] Alex Regueiro: Yes. But let me attest, as a tall guy who has tried playing basketball (not at a high level), white men CANNOT jump.
[03/02/2023, 03:13:23] Alex Regueiro: Sample size of one, but I maintain it holds.
[03/02/2023, 03:13:26] Alice Lafferty: Yes. It doesn't have to be then though. I was working around my parents.
[03/02/2023, 03:13:41] Alice Lafferty: Haha!
[03/02/2023, 03:13:52] Alice Lafferty: Let's see who the world record holding high jumper is...
[03/02/2023, 03:14:03] Alex Regueiro: Good point. Tell me.
[03/02/2023, 03:14:51] Alice Lafferty: Javier Sotomayor - Cuban.
[03/02/2023, 03:14:52] Alex Regueiro: Oh okay. I'm somewhat busy next weekend, but happy to do it some weekday if you'd like?
[03/02/2023, 03:15:01] Alice Lafferty: He clearly has African heritage though to be fair.
[03/02/2023, 03:15:26] Alex Regueiro: Oh I thought a Cuban was the long-jump champion. Maybe both.
[03/02/2023, 03:15:29] Alice Lafferty: Oh but the world's no 3 is a swedish guy! So
[03/02/2023, 03:15:40] Alex Regueiro: Jonathan Edwards is a real outlier in terms of jumpers. Pasty white Englishman holding the world record.
[03/02/2023, 03:16:04] Alice Lafferty: Maybe yeah
[03/02/2023, 03:16:29] Alice Lafferty: But doesn't somewhere like Croatia produce a lot of champion athletes or something like that...
[03/02/2023, 03:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Hmm you could be right
[03/02/2023, 03:17:12] Alice Lafferty: Yes I'm free next week apart from Monday.
[03/02/2023, 03:17:37] Alex Regueiro: I guess I buy into the simplistic narrative that men from (certain) West African populations have a very high proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibre compared to most other humans, hence they excel at tests of speed and explosive power.
[03/02/2023, 03:17:39] Alice Lafferty: I hope you didn't offer to come with me out of politeness by the way.. I can still go with my parents.
[03/02/2023, 03:17:56] Alex Regueiro: There's definitely something to that, even if it's a bit too naive!
[03/02/2023, 03:18:07] Alice Lafferty: From a single valley in Kenya even right?
[03/02/2023, 03:18:37] Alex Regueiro: No, I offered partly because I'd like to keep you company, partly because I'd genuinely enjoy a day trip seeing Chichester and that tomb with you. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 03:18:41] Alice Lafferty: What other factors could be at play?
[03/02/2023, 03:19:38] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[03/02/2023, 03:20:01] Alex Regueiro: Oh that's with the endurance runners. Parts of Kenya and Ethiopia. As far as I know East Africans don't have a particular predisposition towards sprinting/power. But yeah, clearly there's something genetic there too.
[03/02/2023, 03:20:15] Alex Regueiro: We'll stop there though, before we turn this conversation in an Izzy direction üòâ
[03/02/2023, 03:20:18] Alice Lafferty: Oh right yeah
[03/02/2023, 03:20:25] Alice Lafferty: Ha yeah!
[03/02/2023, 03:20:38] Alex Regueiro: Oh incidentally
[03/02/2023, 03:20:53] Alex Regueiro: I ruled out the 18th because that's when Yojimbo is playing at the BFI!
[03/02/2023, 03:20:56] Alex Regueiro: I was hoping you'd be up for that
[03/02/2023, 03:21:15] Alice Lafferty: There must be a way of discussing this without slipping into like emotional racism.
[03/02/2023, 03:21:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, yes for sure
[03/02/2023, 03:22:11] Alice Lafferty: Is that in the evening again?
[03/02/2023, 03:22:40] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. In fact I think I do pretty well at that... if anyone can fairly accuse me of anything like racism, it might be a very weak form of "scientific racism", but not the visceral emotional kind.
[03/02/2023, 03:22:51] Alex Regueiro: Okay let me check. And great!
[03/02/2023, 03:23:09] Alice Lafferty: Yes me too (I hope). You would call this 'high-decoupling' right
[03/02/2023, 03:23:19] Alex Regueiro: Exactly
[03/02/2023, 03:23:22] Alex Regueiro: (I hope)
[03/02/2023, 03:23:50] Alex Regueiro: Oh and I watched half of Ikiru a couple of nights ago before I got too tired. Will give you the verdict in a day or two!
[03/02/2023, 03:24:11] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah I forgot to ask about that!
[03/02/2023, 03:24:11] Alex Regueiro: 20:45
[03/02/2023, 03:24:34] Alice Lafferty: I can do that
[03/02/2023, 03:24:41] Alex Regueiro: Splendid
[03/02/2023, 03:25:33] Alice Lafferty: I will let you know about Chichester. If I can design a bit of an itinerary then we will go ahead with it.
[03/02/2023, 03:25:50] Alex Regueiro: I'll just book you a ticket again yeah? To make choosing seats easy.
[03/02/2023, 03:25:56] Alex Regueiro: Do you get a student concession?
[03/02/2023, 03:26:15] Alice Lafferty: It's a good 3 hour train journey plus bus both waysüôÅ
[03/02/2023, 03:26:26] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[03/02/2023, 03:26:36] Alice Lafferty: Technically not any more..
[03/02/2023, 03:26:49] Alex Regueiro: In that case you'll have to bring a good cryptic crossword or two, so we can whittle away the time!
[03/02/2023, 03:27:11] Alice Lafferty: Exactly! It does cross the south downs as you said so might be scenic
[03/02/2023, 03:27:15] Alex Regueiro: Aren't you still technically enrolled though? We're talking about ¬£2 hah, but still
[03/02/2023, 03:27:41] Alice Lafferty: I'm not, no
[03/02/2023, 03:27:52] Alice Lafferty: Oh well
[03/02/2023, 03:28:17] Alex Regueiro: Absolutely. Overground trains are by far the best / least bothersome mode of transport!
[03/02/2023, 03:28:49] Alex Regueiro: And I would genuinely be up for learning the tricks from a cryptic expert üòâ
[03/02/2023, 03:29:15] Alice Lafferty: I agree. Provincial bus service on the other hand
[03/02/2023, 03:29:17] Alex Regueiro: Oh okay. Then we won't tell BFI I bought you a concession last time ü§ê
[03/02/2023, 03:29:27] Alice Lafferty: No expert! But we can do some
[03/02/2023, 03:29:45] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah - that's what I meant.
[03/02/2023, 03:29:54] Alice Lafferty: I always get concession tickets anyway
[03/02/2023, 03:30:06] Alice Lafferty: It literally doesn't matter
[03/02/2023, 03:30:08] Alex Regueiro: It was an entirely light-hearted suggestion. But I'd be more than happy to if you're up for it!
[03/02/2023, 03:30:24] Alex Regueiro: Haha and here's me thinking you're Miss Goody Two Shoes...
[03/02/2023, 03:31:03] Alice Lafferty: Oh no the BFI will make an ¬£8 profit on my ticket instead of a ¬£10 oneüôÑ
[03/02/2023, 03:31:05] Alex Regueiro: Still not as bad as my dad though
[03/02/2023, 03:31:13] Alex Regueiro: Indeed!
[03/02/2023, 03:31:21] Alice Lafferty: ?
[03/02/2023, 03:31:44] Alex Regueiro: In fat I insist on doing it now: they have the cheek to automatically add on a ¬£5 donation to each order.
[03/02/2023, 03:31:58] Alex Regueiro: I'll do the same as last time then: one concession, one normal price.
[03/02/2023, 03:32:32] Alice Lafferty: If you buy a concession for yourself, would they even pick up on it?
[03/02/2023, 03:32:49] Alex Regueiro: He claimed he and my mum were seniors several years before they hit the age, and when I went with them once, that I was a student... about 5 years out of uni ha
[03/02/2023, 03:33:05] Alex Regueiro: Almost surely not
[03/02/2023, 03:33:19] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[03/02/2023, 03:33:34] Alice Lafferty: Like parents getting child prices for their 15 year olds...
[03/02/2023, 03:33:36] Alex Regueiro: Okay booked!
[03/02/2023, 03:33:55] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I will paypal you for the ticket in usual fashion.
[03/02/2023, 03:34:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah haha. Thankfully he stopped short of that. I would never have forgiven him for making me walk around on my knees and make childish exclamations!
[03/02/2023, 03:34:49] Alex Regueiro: Sure but no rush. We might have to do some balancing of accounts after Chichester anyway.
[03/02/2023, 03:35:00] Alex Regueiro: If that goes through. No pressure.
[03/02/2023, 03:35:34] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I think admission to the cathedral is free
[03/02/2023, 03:36:06] Alex Regueiro: Fair. And probably won't be difficult to buy train tickets ourselves and make sure we get the same area.
[03/02/2023, 03:36:16] Alice Lafferty: I would not consent to that no..
[03/02/2023, 03:36:35] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[03/02/2023, 03:36:49] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to make some food now
[03/02/2023, 03:37:12] Alex Regueiro: !
[03/02/2023, 03:37:19] Alex Regueiro: Good idea
[03/02/2023, 03:37:22] Alice Lafferty: Do you know when Izzy's party will be?
[03/02/2023, 03:37:25] Alex Regueiro: What are you making?
[03/02/2023, 03:38:12] Alex Regueiro: I think he said in a few weeks. Maybe three? Hasn't told me the details yet though
[03/02/2023, 03:38:21] Alice Lafferty: I have tomatoes, bell peppers and kale... I'm going to make a "melange"
[03/02/2023, 03:38:26] Alice Lafferty: A Tomato Confusion
[03/02/2023, 03:38:32] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[03/02/2023, 03:38:34] Alex Regueiro: And not sure if it will be at his flat like last time, or somewhere public.
[03/02/2023, 03:38:48] Alex Regueiro: Hah nice. It sure sounds healthy at least!
[03/02/2023, 03:39:14] Alice Lafferty: Yeah especially if you don't count the half a pound of cheese on top
[03/02/2023, 03:39:20] Alex Regueiro: I had a curry earlier. But it tasted so good, screw health!
[03/02/2023, 03:40:06] Alice Lafferty: Curries can be healthy! But I guess this one wasn't..
[03/02/2023, 03:40:36] Alex Regueiro: Yeah to be fair they're not that bad. I think my meal was pretty health-neutral
[03/02/2023, 03:40:51] Alice Lafferty: It's fine. I barely cook proper meals, I just put random stuff in a pan. It's a real state.
[03/02/2023, 03:41:11] Alex Regueiro: I was going to ask before actually. Interesting.
[03/02/2023, 03:41:17] Alice Lafferty: That is all you need
[03/02/2023, 03:41:32] Alice Lafferty: I mean, technically it's a freestyle kind of soup
[03/02/2023, 03:41:38] Alex Regueiro: I take pride in the few meals I can cook well! I'm just a lazy bastard when I'm working/busy.
[03/02/2023, 03:41:54] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Gym offset it anyway, right?
[03/02/2023, 03:42:15] Alice Lafferty: Like what?
[03/02/2023, 03:44:10] Alex Regueiro: A few nice pasta dishes (arrabbiata, spinach and ricotta tortellini), a good Chinese stir fry (with egg fried rice), a couple of nice Thai stir fries...
[03/02/2023, 03:44:26] Alex Regueiro: Oh and one or two fish dishes.
[03/02/2023, 03:44:29] Alice Lafferty: Oh wow...
[03/02/2023, 03:44:52] Alice Lafferty: I was exaggerating a bit about not being able to cook, but I truly cannot do these.
[03/02/2023, 03:45:38] Alex Regueiro: I once made a whole curry avec accoutrements from scratch, but please commit me if I do that again. It also stunk up the kitchen for a full week.
[03/02/2023, 03:45:58] Alice Lafferty: You don't handmake the tortellini?
[03/02/2023, 03:46:09] Alex Regueiro: I get the feeling you have more culinary competence than your average undergrad to be fair
[03/02/2023, 03:46:14] Alex Regueiro: I do
[03/02/2023, 03:46:29] Alex Regueiro: Sis got my a pasta maker for Christmas a few years back
[03/02/2023, 03:46:41] Alice Lafferty: Yes that is quite something. I think I usually get those little jars of paste
[03/02/2023, 03:46:56] Alice Lafferty: I am very impressed.
[03/02/2023, 03:47:04] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah I think you mentioned
[03/02/2023, 03:47:28] Alice Lafferty: It sounds really fun, but the sort of thing I would use only once or twice.
‚Äé[03/02/2023, 03:47:35] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[03/02/2023, 03:48:18] Alex Regueiro: Yeah we did that too. Sharwood's or something. Actually not that bad.
[03/02/2023, 03:49:02] Alex Regueiro: To be fair I use it maybe a couple of times a year. Special occasions.
[03/02/2023, 03:49:07] Alice Lafferty: People call stir-fries 'quick' meals but they are so labour intensive
[03/02/2023, 03:49:50] Alice Lafferty: Yeah. I imagine most Indian restaurants like make batches using something similar anyway..?
[03/02/2023, 03:50:05] Alice Lafferty: Maybe their own special spice blend.
[03/02/2023, 03:50:37] Alex Regueiro: Honestly they are. Deceptively simple. If only it were just "chuck it all in a pan and stir it around"
[03/02/2023, 03:50:48] Alex Regueiro: One of those things were the name does it a disservice
[03/02/2023, 03:51:16] Alex Regueiro: Exactly that. Weekly or even monthly batches of "base curry sauce" and such, to which they add embellishments to order.
[03/02/2023, 03:51:30] Alice Lafferty: I'm struggling out here trying to slice a bell pepper...
[03/02/2023, 03:52:09] Alex Regueiro: It's not as bad as it sounds! It stores really well, apparently.
[03/02/2023, 03:52:18] Alice Lafferty: They're so inconveniently shaped.
[03/02/2023, 03:52:21] Alex Regueiro: Poor little Alice hands...
[03/02/2023, 03:52:26] Alice Lafferty: I know, I'm sure!
[03/02/2023, 03:52:42] Alex Regueiro: I know. Terribly inconsiderate of nature, isn't it?
[03/02/2023, 03:52:55] Alice Lafferty: The wool was really removed from my eyes when I realised how many restaurants just heat up batches of pre-cooked food in a microwave.
[03/02/2023, 03:53:21] Alice Lafferty: I know it's naive but I really didn't realise that until very recently.
[03/02/2023, 03:53:34] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. And desserts are often just shipped frozen from some warehouse! üòî
[03/02/2023, 03:53:42] Alex Regueiro: Nor did I until relatively late
[03/02/2023, 03:54:24] Alex Regueiro: Okay, I'm going to leave you to your battle with the bell pepper now...
[03/02/2023, 03:54:26] Alice Lafferty: Yep. Takes the shine off it a bit
[03/02/2023, 03:54:41] Alex Regueiro: But before I go, some articles I was just digging up:
[03/02/2023, 03:54:45] Alice Lafferty: Okü´°
[03/02/2023, 03:55:28] Alex Regueiro: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069397112471806
I think that's the one that suggests almost all cultures/societies prefer slightly feminised male features? It also talks about "facial averageness". Interesting either way
‚Äé[03/02/2023, 03:55:43] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[03/02/2023, 03:55:54] Alex Regueiro: Gute nacht ü´°
[03/02/2023, 03:56:54] Alice Lafferty: Thank you
[03/02/2023, 03:57:25] Alex Regueiro: So does realising we live in a world where only murk is real...
[03/02/2023, 03:57:48] Alex Regueiro: Have fun. üßõüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[03/02/2023, 03:57:57] Alice Lafferty: Ok... interesting
[03/02/2023, 03:58:08] Alice Lafferty: Yesüòî
[03/02/2023, 16:34:03] Alex Regueiro: I know, random. Just thought it was kind of interesting. üôÇ
[03/02/2023, 16:34:24] Alex Regueiro: Structural murk, at least! Post-murkism murk.
[03/02/2023, 16:34:32] Alex Regueiro: Hope you had a good night
[05/02/2023, 10:11:27] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I'm getting bad at replying again
‚Äé[05/02/2023, 10:16:48] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[05/02/2023, 10:17:18] Alice Lafferty: I should learn more about Buddhism really. People have posited some early exchange between Buddhism and Christianity... there were certainly Buddhists living on the mediterranean coast in 1C AD. But to be honest the connection seems specious to me.
[05/02/2023, 10:20:05] Alice Lafferty: I think it could offer some therapeutic benefits.
[05/02/2023, 10:21:11] Alice Lafferty: Travel to Chichester is actually 'only' 1hr 50minutes and no bus :)
[05/02/2023, 10:27:33] Alice Lafferty: There's also Fishbourne Roman Palace... Arundel Cathedral is one train stop away and probably the more architecturally impressive, but you might be a bit churched out by thenüòï
[05/02/2023, 10:28:22] Alice Lafferty: Totally unrelated but have you ever been to Sutton Hoo?
[05/02/2023, 16:18:21] Alex Regueiro: Don't be silly, you're quite entitled to go AWOL for a bit.üôÇ
[05/02/2023, 16:18:33] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[05/02/2023, 16:18:43] Alex Regueiro: I was feeling slightly off the last couple of days anyway, so...
‚Äé[05/02/2023, 16:19:42] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[05/02/2023, 16:19:55] Alex Regueiro: There are lots of cool medieval and early modern maps on that group too
[05/02/2023, 16:20:50] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I've heard of that too. People love to make all sorts of wild hypotheses for Jesus's lost years (or whatever they're called), like travelling to India.
[05/02/2023, 16:21:44] Alex Regueiro: Personally I think the influence of Buddhism on Stoicism seems pretty clearcut, and Stoicism in turn influenced early Christianity, at least in a very general way, so maybe that's the truth of the matter? A very indirect link.
[05/02/2023, 16:23:57] Alex Regueiro: And yes, it can. I'm not such a fan of its life-denying aspects, but I did very much flirt with it in my early 20s, and it was really interesting. I find Stoicism a little more palatable, but even I couldn't bring myself to embrace even that in the long run. A syncretic stoicism-epicureanism sounds awfully nice, though I'm not sure if it's too paradoxical. üòâ
[05/02/2023, 16:25:52] Alex Regueiro: Excellent! 3 hours did seem surprisingly long. I'd probably be up for Fishbourne Roman Palace... if you are? I vaguely remember hearing about it in my classics/Latin classes in school. Don't want to try to cram in too much, but that's probably doable.
[05/02/2023, 16:27:16] Alex Regueiro: Speaking of school, I missed the class trip to Sutton Hoo when I was about 12... As it happens, a trip there has been on my mind for the last year or so.
[05/02/2023, 16:27:20] Alex Regueiro: Have you been?
[06/02/2023, 07:13:11] Alice Lafferty: Huh, is it clearcut that Buddhism influenced Stoicism? Can't think how unless maybe indirectly via Cynic contact with the east. Not sure at all though.
[06/02/2023, 07:13:42] Alice Lafferty: Hm yes it would be internally incoherent but they both basically share the same aim of achieving 'ataraxia' or whatever, right?
[06/02/2023, 07:14:11] Alice Lafferty: Is Facebook still good for this sort of stuff? I thought it was kind of falling out of use.
[06/02/2023, 07:15:34] Alice Lafferty: I haven't. I watched the film The Dig with my family haha and it looks interesting!
[06/02/2023, 07:16:52] Alice Lafferty: Speaking of Netflix I caught up with Midnight Mass. Vibes are improving..
[06/02/2023, 07:17:20] Alice Lafferty: I like watching American dramas and the actors' immaculate teethüëå
[06/02/2023, 07:18:22] Alice Lafferty: No I haven't. Speaking of Netflix, I watched The Dig with my family ha and it looked really interesting!
[06/02/2023, 07:19:05] Alice Lafferty: Everything OK?
[06/02/2023, 07:20:06] Alice Lafferty: Hm I said 'speaking of Netflix twice' :S
[06/02/2023, 20:51:38] Alice Lafferty: Re Fishbourne... these Roman archaeological sites can in my experience be interesting or just titanically boring, depends on how the information is presented.
[06/02/2023, 20:51:52] Alex Regueiro: Hello!
[06/02/2023, 20:52:03] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, just got back to my computer...
[06/02/2023, 20:52:09] Alex Regueiro: Good timing
[06/02/2023, 20:52:12] Alice Lafferty: Completely fine
[06/02/2023, 20:52:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I quite agree. Since architecturally they're usually in complete ruin and somewhat visually lacking without a lot of historical information and whatnot.
[06/02/2023, 20:53:38] Alex Regueiro: All good, but thanks for asking. Just a little out of kilter on this occasion, nothing more.
[06/02/2023, 20:54:01] Alex Regueiro: Hah that sounds like an Alexism. Or maybe it's a bonafide Alicism. I'm honestly not sure.
[06/02/2023, 20:54:33] Alex Regueiro: Ahh I've been meaning to see that for a while! Worth a watch? Anyway I'd definitely like to go to Sutton Hoo at some point. Maybe later this year.
[06/02/2023, 20:54:38] Alice Lafferty: Yep... it's also closed until the 11th apparently.
[06/02/2023, 20:54:47] Alice Lafferty: Although that's not so long I suppose
[06/02/2023, 20:55:14] Alice Lafferty: It's quite a sweet film.
[06/02/2023, 20:55:32] Alex Regueiro: Haha I find it a little offputting sometimes. Also somewhat miffed that the British bad teeth stereotype somehow persists over there, when in reality we have perfectly "normal" (just not artificially whitened) teeth for the most part.
[06/02/2023, 20:56:07] Alex Regueiro: Ah right. We were planning to go to Chichester a little after that, though, so all fine in theory?
[06/02/2023, 20:56:43] Alice Lafferty: True, although I personally fail to beat the British have bad teeth allegations... It's good though, I like the americana
[06/02/2023, 20:56:44] Alex Regueiro: Anyway glad the series is growing on. It's certainly a slow build. Quite the crescendo though!
[06/02/2023, 20:57:06] Alice Lafferty: Same really
[06/02/2023, 20:57:34] Alex Regueiro: Hmm I can't say I've noticed you having bad teeth. You're just being a bit self-conscious, I bet.
[06/02/2023, 20:58:10] Alice Lafferty: Let me know which days you are free. I thought a weekday might avoid tourists a bit but on the other hand we might get the school trips..
[06/02/2023, 20:58:10] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah it's fun to watch. Not so much to live in, is my impression. But I particularly enjoy 50s/60s Americana in films.
[06/02/2023, 20:58:59] Alice Lafferty: Or did you already suggest a dateü§î I can't remember
[06/02/2023, 20:59:17] Alex Regueiro: It's holding up quite impressively really. I'd say > 50% of my Facebook usage is interesting posts and factoids from various groups heh
[06/02/2023, 21:00:33] Alice Lafferty: Hm interesting. I know it has good special interest/hobby groups (reddit does too to be fair), which don't get contaminated with politics maybe?
[06/02/2023, 21:02:09] Alex Regueiro: I think we sort of agreed one some time next week, but nothing more? I can do any weekday except maybe Thursday, so take your pick. And yeah, I reckon a weekday is still best. Doubt it's the high season for school trips.
[06/02/2023, 21:02:48] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[06/02/2023, 21:03:09] Alex Regueiro: God save us all from Reddit. Well, most of the subreddits. The moderation/administration system on Facebook seems to be substantially better (more community run) and the groups much less political on the whole. I'm a passive member in most of them anyway. üôÇ
[06/02/2023, 21:03:57] Alex Regueiro: You'd love the few church and church monuments groups I'm in. I think I mentioned them before. Not enough of a reason to join Facebook, but still!
[06/02/2023, 21:05:02] Alex Regueiro: I keep wondering if the weather plays a role, at least with more sensitive types like us! Still not decided if it's pseudoscience.
[06/02/2023, 21:05:08] Alice Lafferty: Haha I know it's like 'cringe' now, but it's been a really good resource for plants, knitting, hardware stuff etc I've found. Aren't most subreddits also moderated largely by volunteers?
[06/02/2023, 21:05:22] Alex Regueiro: I also realise I'm replying to all your messages in reverse order for some reason hah...
[06/02/2023, 21:06:09] Alice Lafferty: No you haven't! Maybe you can give some recommendations and I can get a facebook account very late in the dayüëÄ
[06/02/2023, 21:06:23] Alice Lafferty: It's fine
[06/02/2023, 21:06:26] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, there is some great stuff there nonetheless. Some of the huge subreddits or political ones are just plain nasty though.
[06/02/2023, 21:06:40] Alex Regueiro: There are so many stereotypes about Reddit mods, and alas, too many of them are often true...
[06/02/2023, 21:06:52] Alice Lafferty: Seasonal affective disorder is 'real', right?
[06/02/2023, 21:07:32] Alex Regueiro: Facebook groups tend to be run by much more "normal" people on the whole (in terms of civility and personality disorders, that is)
[06/02/2023, 21:07:46] Alice Lafferty: I don't know if I suffer from that particularly, episodes of low mood are quite consistent throughout the year. What about you?
[06/02/2023, 21:08:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I meant more like low-pressure systems. I thought I had SAD at one point, but not sure any more. I do sometimes get spells of the winter blues, but it's hardly consistent. And I enjoy winter in some other ways so...
[06/02/2023, 21:08:35] Alice Lafferty: Ha! Probably average user is slightly olderas well I guess?
[06/02/2023, 21:09:05] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting, I haven't heard about that.
[06/02/2023, 21:09:28] Alex Regueiro: Hehe. Why not! You seem to regulate yourself pretty well, and you could always make it private and just keep a few friends... if you do decide to join, I'll trawl through all the groups I'm in and make a list of ones you might like.
[06/02/2023, 21:09:58] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, definitely. Especially in the sorts of groups I'm in hah.
[06/02/2023, 21:10:06] Alice Lafferty: I'm just looking at the barometric pressure stuff..
[06/02/2023, 21:10:07] Alex Regueiro: Boomer wisdom / general sanity... you don't hear that often
[06/02/2023, 21:10:39] Alice Lafferty: Ha thank you that would be nice
[06/02/2023, 21:11:01] Alice Lafferty: Yeah wasn't Facebook like the primary boomer radicalisation vehicle
[06/02/2023, 21:11:11] Alice Lafferty: Maybe this is more of an American thing.
[06/02/2023, 21:15:29] Alex Regueiro: Yep, pretty much. Obviously belief in reincarnation is one of the big differences, but still a few core similarities. I forget, but didn't some important Greek philosopher of that period travel to India with Alexander the Great? Diogenes was obviously a little too early to get any Indian influences, but funnily enough Zeno was born in the year of Alexander's death. So the coincidences between Cynicism and Buddhism must be purely coincidental, but Stoicism of course departs from pure Cynicism in a few ways. Some of the ideas may have filtered west by the time of Zeno anyway (whom some say was of Phoenician origin!)
[06/02/2023, 21:15:31] Alice Lafferty: According to the weather app, air pressure is slightly on the high side right now. Also seems to have dropped off from Sunday night. Trouble is I don't know what normal variation is.
[06/02/2023, 21:15:39] Alex Regueiro: Gladly
[06/02/2023, 21:17:32] Alex Regueiro: Hah quite possibly. I reckon Facebook has got a lot of attention (Russian election interference, Cambridge Analytica, etc.) partly because it's just much more mainstream in the age groups of the current ruling class. If you dig into all the dodgy stuff that's happened with Reddit over the last few years, it might well match or even outweigh the Facebook-related scandals!
[06/02/2023, 21:18:05] Alex Regueiro: Yeah nor do I. Just that 1 bar or a tad over is normal.
[06/02/2023, 21:19:26] Alice Lafferty: I really don't know to be honest.. I had thought the exchanges between Greek and Indian philosophy to be minimal, mainly because there was not a strong Greek-Sanskrit translation culture. It's entirely possible though.
[06/02/2023, 21:20:57] Alice Lafferty: Haha did you see that thing where like a huge proportion of activity on reddit came from like a US military base? Or was that fake?
[06/02/2023, 21:21:12] Alex Regueiro: I think it was non-existent before the Hellenistic age (which as it happened reintroduced writing to India, many think!). After Alexander, I think it's debated, but has always seemed plausible to me there was some bidirectional influence. Certainly in the direction of the Greeks on the Indians, since Indo-Greek and Graeco-Bactrian kingdoms were established in the area Alexander conquered.
[06/02/2023, 21:21:23] Alex Regueiro: No ha! Tell me.
[06/02/2023, 21:23:17] Alex Regueiro: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/ukpfl/is_reddit_being_manipulated_by_the_us_army/
[06/02/2023, 21:23:18] Alex Regueiro: ha
[06/02/2023, 21:24:10] Alice Lafferty: Ah yeah it was Eglin Airforce Base
[06/02/2023, 21:25:59] Alex Regueiro: Oh, it was Pyrrho who travelled to India with Alexander and interacted with the ascetics there. Honestly that kind of makes sense, since you find extreme scepticism in some branches of ancient Indian philosophy, as I recall.
[06/02/2023, 21:26:13] Alice Lafferty: Could be nothing to be honest. Can't find any references to it outside of reddit.
[06/02/2023, 21:27:07] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, surely the entire cultural transmission didn't happen through this one guy though?
[06/02/2023, 21:27:09] Alex Regueiro: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks but that's really old and the Guardian...
[06/02/2023, 21:27:48] Alice Lafferty: Hm it sounds similar to Russiagate style stuff.
[06/02/2023, 21:28:01] Alex Regueiro: Hards to know how legit it is. But honestly, Reddit is probably the wellspring of many a (neo-progressive American) conspiracy theory. People always think of 4chan, and rightly so, but that doesn't get Reddit off the hook.
[06/02/2023, 21:29:41] Alex Regueiro: You wouldn't think so haha. It must be really hard to attribute particular Greek or Indian intellectual/philosophical developments to clear east-west or west-east transmission, but I still can't help but think the timing of the birth of Stoicism and some of the common ideas it shares with Buddhism is a little uncanny...
[06/02/2023, 21:32:44] Alice Lafferty: You've got me interested in this now!
[06/02/2023, 21:33:28] Alice Lafferty: You think that conspiracies just arose there or were deliberately seeded?
[06/02/2023, 21:34:18] Alice Lafferty: I never knew how much stock to put in Russian (or indeed American) 'disinformation' scares...
[06/02/2023, 21:35:10] Alice Lafferty: Becomes increasingly insane sounding the higher up the US government you implicate.
‚Äé[06/02/2023, 21:36:18] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[06/02/2023, 21:37:31] Alice Lafferty: Anyway maybe this isn't exactly what you were talking about, but that was the the gist of the Elgin Airforce base story.
[06/02/2023, 21:42:18] Alex Regueiro: I still don't. I mean, I suspect the Russians did try to interfere by manipulating social media content and ads, but still can't believe myself to believe the US (even Trump) was in bed with them on this.
[06/02/2023, 21:42:35] Alex Regueiro: At most it was fortuitous from Trump's perspective, I'd say
[06/02/2023, 21:43:18] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah it's crazy. That I believe. Musk may be a little off his rocker, but he's no fool, and he was right to kick up a fuss about the number of Twitter bots and all that.
[06/02/2023, 21:44:20] Alice Lafferty: Accepting that this happened would be quite worldview-destabilising really.
[06/02/2023, 21:45:06] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, weird that we can't get a number on it though.
[06/02/2023, 21:45:23] Alex Regueiro: Their manipulation, if it's real, seems much less worrying next to these other things. I mean, it would just be to generate a more positive image of the US military, mainly among their own citizens? Only slightly devious in the grand scheme of things.
[06/02/2023, 21:45:41] Alex Regueiro: I did enjoy him blowing open the Twitter Files in any case.
[06/02/2023, 21:46:41] Alice Lafferty: I think the idea was that it was sort of entire programme of opinion influencing being run out that military base.
[06/02/2023, 21:47:14] Alex Regueiro: Yep. Though the Hunter Biden laptop thing is nearly as crazy/bad, but has been hushed up very effectively by the establishment, even though there are clearly large elements of truth to the "conspiracies". (Note to self: if someone says anything true and awful about you or groups you belong to, just brand it a "conspiracy" and be done with it.)
[06/02/2023, 21:47:17] Alice Lafferty: I didn't really follow that properly!
[06/02/2023, 21:47:21] Alex Regueiro: Hmm I see
[06/02/2023, 21:49:23] Alice Lafferty: Ha yeah, but to be fair I think the opposite case, where conspiracies are genuinely fabricated, actually happens much more frequently.
[06/02/2023, 21:49:38] Alex Regueiro: Oh sure it does
[06/02/2023, 21:50:07] Alice Lafferty: And I really don't know about this, I will have to do more research, but what you're saying sounds plausible
[06/02/2023, 22:04:13] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[06/02/2023, 22:04:52] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm not sure historians have a consensus over this, but "very plausible" was my reaction at least. So hard to say with any certainty.
[06/02/2023, 22:05:57] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, I was just to my mum earlier today, I honestly feel so relieved to be out of the political news loop most of the time. It's a much saner way to live. Just to occasionally dive into a story that interests you, and nothing more. üôÇ
[06/02/2023, 22:11:18] Alex Regueiro: So did your family get back a couple of days ago?
‚Äé[07/02/2023, 16:56:03] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[08/02/2023, 19:59:28] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly..
[08/02/2023, 19:59:46] Alice Lafferty: Yep. It was nice to have them back actually.

[08/02/2023, 20:01:52] Alice Lafferty: Fool's Cap Map of the World, 1575
[08/02/2023, 20:02:17] Alice Lafferty: I love the subreddit Map Porn for this!
[08/02/2023, 20:10:26] Alex Regueiro: I think you're just like me in that regard. 5 or 7 days is about perfect in terms of alone time!
[08/02/2023, 20:10:38] Alex Regueiro: Of course, you had the wonderful salon to break it up too...
[08/02/2023, 20:10:46] Alex Regueiro: Following the group banter ha?
[08/02/2023, 20:11:20] Alex Regueiro: Ooh
[08/02/2023, 20:11:42] Alex Regueiro: That's a corker yeah
[08/02/2023, 20:11:47] Alex Regueiro: Who made it?

[08/02/2023, 20:13:08] Alex Regueiro: 1581 map of Asia by Heinrich Bunting (same group from a week ago)
[08/02/2023, 20:15:00] Alex Regueiro: Accuracy and scale be damned, but I still like it heh
[08/02/2023, 20:19:42] Alice Lafferty: Ha yes. I have just made my first contributionüòê
[08/02/2023, 20:19:56] Alice Lafferty: You are very good at responding on there.
[08/02/2023, 20:20:09] Alice Lafferty: Some French guy I think
[08/02/2023, 20:21:59] Alex Regueiro: Thanks for ruining it for me.
[08/02/2023, 20:22:11] Alex Regueiro: Well done. A nice one too!
[08/02/2023, 20:22:31] Alice Lafferty: This is pretty but I don't see what utility it could possibly have as a map...
[08/02/2023, 20:22:52] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, when I'm working (or "working") on the computer most of the day, it's no big deal... plus I feel I ought to respond to people showing enthusiasm, as one of the organisers.
[08/02/2023, 20:23:08] Alice Lafferty: They did not know China existed in 1581?
[08/02/2023, 20:23:33] Alex Regueiro: Yes indeed. I was joking about it on the post itself before. It's good whimsical fun, but decidedly useless otherwise.
[08/02/2023, 20:25:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh sure. Even the Romans had some vague knowledge of Han dynasty China and vice versa. They indirectly traded with each other and sent delegations on two occasions. It's pretty interesting. Then Europeans sort of lost knowledge of China until the High Middle Ages (despite the Silk Road), and finally a few Europeans like Marco Polo started making trips there in the 1200s, "thanks" to the Mongol empire opening everything up.
[08/02/2023, 20:26:25] Alice Lafferty: Right exactly, so it must have been a deliberate omission
[08/02/2023, 20:27:06] Alice Lafferty: Yes true. Now I have to respond to people's follow up theology questionsüò¶
[08/02/2023, 20:27:24] Alex Regueiro: Oh, oops, I just noticed there's no "Sina" or anything on the map. Maybe it was subsumed in India Orientalis hah?
[08/02/2023, 20:28:13] Alex Regueiro: This is the problem now that Eric is no longer there. You're now the resident theologian it seems.
[08/02/2023, 20:28:28] Alex Regueiro: Don't feel obliged though! A brief reply would be nice, but yeah...
[08/02/2023, 20:29:30] Alex Regueiro: "O head, worthy of a dose of hellebore"
[08/02/2023, 20:46:08] Alice Lafferty: I always paint myself into a corner
[08/02/2023, 20:46:17] Alice Lafferty: ü§î
[08/02/2023, 20:47:51] Alex Regueiro: Those olden timers played fast and loose with names of places, after all.
[08/02/2023, 20:48:24] Alex Regueiro: Hah. In fairness you tried pretty hard not to at the salon. I think you only let on you were a theology student when Rush asked?
[08/02/2023, 20:55:19] Alice Lafferty: What is this from
[08/02/2023, 20:55:40] Alex Regueiro: A translation of the Latin heading on the map you shared.
[08/02/2023, 20:57:13] Alice Lafferty: üòÜ I didn't even take the time to read it
[08/02/2023, 20:57:40] Alex Regueiro: Nor did I with the Pegasus map, so we're even?!
[08/02/2023, 20:57:41] Alice Lafferty: That is interesting. Hellebore is an emetic I think.
[08/02/2023, 20:57:57] Alex Regueiro: Fun fun
[08/02/2023, 20:58:06] Alex Regueiro: Certainly sounds poisonous
[08/02/2023, 21:09:55] Alex Regueiro: Just booked the room for the next salon üôÇ
[08/02/2023, 21:09:59] Alex Regueiro: Thursday 23rd
[08/02/2023, 23:04:53] Alice Lafferty: Oh great, same place?
[08/02/2023, 23:05:30] Alice Lafferty: Has the topic been decided yet?
[08/02/2023, 23:12:44] Alex Regueiro: Yup
[08/02/2023, 23:13:34] Alex Regueiro: Nope, not decided yet, but the idea is to have Tesh host it.
[08/02/2023, 23:13:57] Alice Lafferty: Ok niceüëç
[08/02/2023, 23:14:07] Alex Regueiro: We have an organisers group and we're starting to plan it...
[08/02/2023, 23:14:18] Alex Regueiro: I'll let you know if there's anything you can do to help though, don't worry! üôÇ
[08/02/2023, 23:14:37] Alice Lafferty: Yeah! Ok
[08/02/2023, 23:18:19] Alex Regueiro: You'll get to meet some nice new people too.
[08/02/2023, 23:18:28] Alex Regueiro: Caitlin and Summer should make this one
[08/02/2023, 23:18:42] Alex Regueiro: Thursday helps some people, so we might alternate
[08/02/2023, 23:20:14] Alex Regueiro: Oh FYI, do mute the group chat for your sanity, if you haven't already. The notifications occasionally get crazy hah. Even I have it muted.
[09/02/2023, 08:18:42] Alice Lafferty: It hasn't been too bad so far!
[09/02/2023, 08:19:54] Alice Lafferty: I can imagine if something gets everybody riled up.
[09/02/2023, 15:37:53] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's not been
[09/02/2023, 15:37:57] Alex Regueiro: But that occasionally happens haha
[09/02/2023, 15:38:12] Alex Regueiro: Even if it's in a good way
[09/02/2023, 15:38:24] Alex Regueiro: I think the record for me was 200 unread messages!
[09/02/2023, 15:38:33] Alex Regueiro: Anyway just a warning üòâ
[09/02/2023, 15:38:54] Alex Regueiro: It was a bit more active back in those days
[09/02/2023, 15:39:05] Alex Regueiro: 8 o'clock uff
[09/02/2023, 15:39:16] Alex Regueiro: Still sleeping biphasally?
[09/02/2023, 15:43:41] Alex Regueiro: Oh by the way, I watched Ikiru
[09/02/2023, 15:43:46] Alex Regueiro: It's very good
[09/02/2023, 15:44:19] Alex Regueiro: Maybe not one of Kurosawa's best... but it builds nicely, and has a great arc.
[09/02/2023, 15:44:42] Alex Regueiro: Making progress with Midnight Mass still?
[09/02/2023, 15:46:06] Alex Regueiro: Also, shall we choose a day and book our train tickets for Chichester? üòä
[09/02/2023, 15:46:42] Alex Regueiro: I'm happy to do Fishbourne Palace. Looks somewhat interesting at least! Up to you.
[09/02/2023, 15:47:53] Alex Regueiro: I also saw there are a couple of really nice gardens in Chichester, so we could have a wonder through one/both of them. At least if the weather's as nice as today. üôèüèº
[10/02/2023, 09:19:56] Alice Lafferty: Oh nice, I'd be really curious to see how he does that sort of tragic drama. Were there still moments of comedic relief?
[10/02/2023, 09:20:26] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I will try and pirate it myself.
[10/02/2023, 09:20:36] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[10/02/2023, 09:22:45] Alice Lafferty: Yes.. last episode. The vampire 'angel' is really effectively scary.
[10/02/2023, 09:23:53] Alice Lafferty: Unsure about the pitting of dogmatic Christians agains liberal Muslim?
[10/02/2023, 09:25:02] Alice Lafferty: Basically interesting though,
[10/02/2023, 09:25:59] Alice Lafferty: Kind of like the temptation in the desert.
[10/02/2023, 09:26:55] Alice Lafferty: Yes we ought to. Afternoon is best for me. You can do any day but Thursday right?
[10/02/2023, 09:35:40] Alice Lafferty: Just had a look. Did you mean West Dean Gardens/ Denmans/ Bishops Palace Gardens (which I think is in the grounds of the cathedral?)
[10/02/2023, 16:12:17] Alex Regueiro: Oh yeah, plenty in the first half or so.
[10/02/2023, 16:12:38] Alex Regueiro: Kurosawa seems to do that really well. One thing he has in common with Kubrick I dare say!
[10/02/2023, 16:13:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, you have to excuse that bit of wokeness. Equally though, it has room for some good Christians, so it's far from the worst sort of thing coming out the US these days...
[10/02/2023, 16:13:53] Alex Regueiro: Indeed!
[10/02/2023, 16:14:44] Alex Regueiro: Interesting analogy. I didn't notice that, but it definitely makes sense.
[10/02/2023, 16:14:48] Alex Regueiro: Anyway glad you enjoyed it in the end
[10/02/2023, 16:15:08] Alex Regueiro: Now onto DEVS? Was that the other one I recommended? (In your own time!)
[10/02/2023, 16:15:52] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, West Dean Gardens and Bishop's Gardens were the ones I saw that looked pretty. Perfectly convenient like you say.
[10/02/2023, 16:15:59] Alex Regueiro: Yup!
[10/02/2023, 16:16:11] Alex Regueiro: Does that work for you?
[11/02/2023, 21:24:17] Alice Lafferty: Hi, sorry for taking so long to get back to you. Do you mind if we put of the Chichester trip for a bit?
[11/02/2023, 21:24:29] Alice Lafferty: Sorry for messing you around.
[11/02/2023, 21:24:41] Alice Lafferty: * put off
[11/02/2023, 21:48:02] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[11/02/2023, 21:48:04] Alex Regueiro: That's alright
[11/02/2023, 21:48:14] Alex Regueiro: Not been feeling so well lately? üôÅ
[11/02/2023, 21:52:12] Alex Regueiro: It was very much your idea anyway, so don't feel bad about it! I'd just be your companion on the trip... though don't get me wrong, it sounds fun in its own right.
[13/02/2023, 09:07:08] Alice Lafferty: I know I know, but still that bad habit with cancelling plans.
[13/02/2023, 09:08:34] Alice Lafferty: Are we still going to see Yojimbo?
[13/02/2023, 17:41:29] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, Saturday evening. You up for that still?
[13/02/2023, 17:42:15] Alex Regueiro: I'd probably worry something more serious was up if you didn't cancel occasionally. üòâ
[13/02/2023, 17:44:32] Alex Regueiro: But seriously, I hope you're feeling a little better now... You don't have to tell me what's on your mind, though I'm always up for listening! If I can help in even a small way, it would make me glad.
[13/02/2023, 17:44:47] Alex Regueiro: BTW, I can't remember if you said you liked Leonard Cohen?
[13/02/2023, 20:42:26] Alice Lafferty: Thank you
[13/02/2023, 20:43:02] Alice Lafferty: I do yes. I mean, specifically the acoustic albums and less so the 70s mood instrumentation.
[13/02/2023, 20:43:05] Alice Lafferty: Why?
[13/02/2023, 23:44:14] Alex Regueiro: Hey
[13/02/2023, 23:44:38] Alex Regueiro: Ah right. What sort of songs are you thinking of specifically?
[13/02/2023, 23:45:41] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I went to see a contemporary ballet set to Leonard Cohen music on Saturday. A friend from Bristol suggested it, and since I'm a Cohen fan... was interesting, for sure! I think I enjoyed at least half of it.
[13/02/2023, 23:46:41] Alex Regueiro: Had only seen The Nutcracker and Swan Lake before, so rather outside my comfort zone. But a cool experience!
[13/02/2023, 23:47:30] Alex Regueiro: üòä
[13/02/2023, 23:58:18] Alice Lafferty: Eg. Songs of Love and Hate vs Various Positions
[13/02/2023, 23:58:39] Alex Regueiro: Oh BTW, I finally got around to expanding my music library recently, including a few albums/artists you recommended!
[13/02/2023, 23:58:51] Alice Lafferty: I like Joan of Arc, The Partisan, Sisters of Mercy, Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye.
[13/02/2023, 23:59:10] Alex Regueiro: Got just about enough income coming in I can justify a few purchases heh.
[13/02/2023, 23:59:12] Alice Lafferty: What was it like...?
[13/02/2023, 23:59:35] Alice Lafferty: I can't really imagine his music lending itself to any kind of dance really.
[13/02/2023, 23:59:48] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I always forget the album names with most artists... I need to think about what type of songs of his I prefer.
[14/02/2023, 00:00:04] Alex Regueiro: Nor could I to be honest. But hey, contemporary ballet is a thing to itself...
[14/02/2023, 00:00:14] Alex Regueiro: Half performance art
[14/02/2023, 00:00:29] Alex Regueiro: Very gymnastic in parts
[14/02/2023, 00:00:45] Alex Regueiro: A bit of modern dance integrated into it. Unrecognisable compared to traditional ballet.
[14/02/2023, 00:01:02] Alice Lafferty: Haha, nice. I've taken a lot of classical recs from you + Uriah Heep.
[14/02/2023, 00:01:32] Alice Lafferty: Interesting... I don't mean to be too skeptical!
[14/02/2023, 00:02:18] Alice Lafferty: Never got into that stuff myself but did you think it had some kind of artistic merit?
[14/02/2023, 00:02:45] Alice Lafferty: I did not have the energy to participate in the group chat discussion by the way, but I thought your response was good.
[14/02/2023, 00:02:55] Alex Regueiro: I was pretty sceptical going into it! And some things I didn't like still (like the really 'busy' dance routines and some of the spoken word stuff, or when the dancers stopped dancing and just sat and sang)... but overall, a worthwhile experience.
[14/02/2023, 00:03:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh don't worry at all. I was debating with myself even doing that. I just saw it 1/2 hour ago when Summer pointed it out to me hah.
[14/02/2023, 00:03:40] Alex Regueiro: And thank you
[14/02/2023, 00:03:44] Alice Lafferty: From what I've seen of the genre, I can never help being reminded of GCSE drama classes.
[14/02/2023, 00:04:01] Alex Regueiro: Haha I think I get you...
[14/02/2023, 00:04:30] Alice Lafferty: Like it's very self-serious
[14/02/2023, 00:04:45] Alex Regueiro: Excellent! Did I not give you other rock recommendations? Actually, maybe you'd heard all the others before.
[14/02/2023, 00:05:41] Alice Lafferty: ü§î You made a classical music playlist. But I can't remember now actually.
[14/02/2023, 00:07:04] Alex Regueiro: I really appreciated the Rach Vespers rec from you as you know. Shosta piano concertos too. Then I bought a few Joni Mitchell albums (which had godd stuff that wasn't in my two compilation albums), a Magazine album, Soft Machine, and some Brian Eno stuff.
[14/02/2023, 00:07:23] Alex Regueiro: I already knew Brian Eno of course but had never gotten around to buying his albums...
[14/02/2023, 00:07:27] Alex Regueiro: solo albums
[14/02/2023, 00:07:43] Alice Lafferty: Oh wait you actually paid for this stuff? Don't you have an apple music/spotify subscription?
[14/02/2023, 00:07:45] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I think the rock and other stuff I recommended was more ad-hoc.
[14/02/2023, 00:07:55] Alice Lafferty: I'm so glad you like Magazine...
[14/02/2023, 00:08:52] Alice Lafferty: To be fair Joni Mitchell has removed her suff from Spotify. I don't know if/when it will be replaced.
[14/02/2023, 00:09:16] Alex Regueiro: Noo. I think I told you on our first date? I'm old fogey who insists on owning his music! üòâ Partly out of paranoia these streaming companies will revoke access or go out of business some day, partly for offline access, partly... set in my ways?
[14/02/2023, 00:09:26] Alex Regueiro: Aha. Point in case!
[14/02/2023, 00:09:52] Alice Lafferty: Hmm maybe you did.. but you also have a digital collection right?
[14/02/2023, 00:09:53] Alex Regueiro: Apparently Spotify is a terrible economic deal for all but the mega-popular artists. And even then sometimes...
[14/02/2023, 00:10:21] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I've heard this too. So cheap and convenient for the consumer thoughüò¨
[14/02/2023, 00:10:24] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I'm not sure how I missed that gem!
[14/02/2023, 00:10:51] Alice Lafferty: Is this CDs or something else? I imagine you can get them fairly cheaply now.
[14/02/2023, 00:10:53] Alex Regueiro: I think I got the album that was in your playlist.
[14/02/2023, 00:11:24] Alex Regueiro: Mainly online stores, but also CDs, which I then just rip and store away
[14/02/2023, 00:11:32] Alex Regueiro: This is quite true
[14/02/2023, 00:11:47] Alice Lafferty: Was that Secondhand Daylight I wonder..
[14/02/2023, 00:12:03] Alice Lafferty: If you are interested you should also listen to Real Life (just on youtube).
[14/02/2023, 00:12:13] Alex Regueiro: Oh and I got the first Comus album too.
[14/02/2023, 00:12:19] Alex Regueiro: Yep!
[14/02/2023, 00:12:24] Alex Regueiro: One of your favs?
[14/02/2023, 00:12:57] Alice Lafferty: Good idea maybe. Recently one of my favourite music collections was bizarrely literally scrubbed from every corner of the internet, youtube, spotify, apple..
[14/02/2023, 00:13:20] Alice Lafferty: So have resorted to buying a secondhand CD on ebay and ripping it.
[14/02/2023, 00:13:43] Alice Lafferty: Haha! That was a bit of a curveball maybe.
[14/02/2023, 00:13:51] Alice Lafferty: I do understand why some people don't like it.
[14/02/2023, 00:16:14] Alex Regueiro: Meant to reply to this... It is. I didn't mind the pretence up to a certain point though, and I don't think this ballet was remotely the worst. Plus, my friend enlightened me and her other friend a bit afterwards. She knows ballet really well, traditional and contemporary, so that helps! (She was even a ballerina up to her teens.)
[14/02/2023, 00:16:44] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's pretty far out in some ways haha. Very avante garde for its time!
[14/02/2023, 00:16:55] Alex Regueiro: The first album has some tracks I do enjoy though
[14/02/2023, 00:18:13] Alice Lafferty: Oh interesting. But you said you've seen Swan Lake before right?
[14/02/2023, 00:18:18] Alex Regueiro: Very frustrating. These companies want us to stream rather than buy, but I suspect they might just push a lot of people into pirating everything.
[14/02/2023, 00:18:22] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever seen the film The Red Shoes by the way?
[14/02/2023, 00:18:25] Alex Regueiro: Excellent
[14/02/2023, 00:18:58] Alex Regueiro: Yep. And you?
[14/02/2023, 00:19:05] Alex Regueiro: And The Nutcracker (twice maybe?)
[14/02/2023, 00:19:47] Alice Lafferty: How does contemporary ballet differ? Did they still wear leotards, walk en pointe and stuff..
[14/02/2023, 00:20:01] Alex Regueiro: It's like an entirely different art form though, compared to contemporary. Ballet has seen a huge amount of innovation over the last two hundred years, probably much more than opera.
[14/02/2023, 00:20:03] Alice Lafferty: These are the exact two I've seen as well! Maybe around Christmas time.
[14/02/2023, 00:20:53] Alex Regueiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XojZRmwfus
[14/02/2023, 00:21:07] Alice Lafferty: Right.. I guess what was appealing about traditional ballet was the high degree of control, the special tutus etc. I don't know how much of that is preserved
[14/02/2023, 00:21:16] Alex Regueiro: That will give you a slight taste at least
[14/02/2023, 00:22:37] Alex Regueiro: Haha, I'm not sure what's particularly appealing about tutus... I thought they were just to enable the dancer to bend and contort themselves easier, whilst retaining a bit of elegance and decency?
[14/02/2023, 00:22:42] Alice Lafferty: I see, thank you. If I hadn't been told otherwise I don't think I would have described that as ballet! It looks indistinguishably like 'modern dance' to me. But I know very little about it.
[14/02/2023, 00:23:16] Alex Regueiro: But I agree about the high degree of control. The precision and acrobatic feats are no doubt impressive.
[14/02/2023, 00:23:27] Alex Regueiro: You get that to an extent in modern ballet, though it's much more free-form...
[14/02/2023, 00:23:29] Alice Lafferty: I don't know, maybe they exaggerate waist to hip ratios or something. Probably have a practical purpose too
[14/02/2023, 00:23:49] Alex Regueiro: Yep, like I was alluding to, it doesn't share a whole lot more than the name!
[14/02/2023, 00:24:16] Alice Lafferty: Yeah esp the amount of time spent on the floor. Looks like slowed down breakdancing
[14/02/2023, 00:24:20] Alex Regueiro: It's literally incorporated all sorts of various modern dance styles into it, not to mention elements of performance art.
[14/02/2023, 00:24:49] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, and I'm pretty sure breakdancing is an explicit influence!
[14/02/2023, 00:25:16] Alice Lafferty: As you said definitely 'an experience' anyway. Total philistine about dance, I like the really easily digestible pretty christmas shows.
[14/02/2023, 00:25:39] Alex Regueiro: Aren't you glad you're not living in the era of hoop skirts and corsets?
[14/02/2023, 00:25:57] Alice Lafferty: I think The Herald is really beautiful. Some are just wacky though.
[14/02/2023, 00:25:58] Alex Regueiro: As in... The Nutcracker? üòÄ
[14/02/2023, 00:26:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's probably my favourite as it happens!
[14/02/2023, 00:26:18] Alice Lafferty: You bet I am..
[14/02/2023, 00:27:21] Alex Regueiro: They're sort of like King Crimson, though not quite as good perhaps. But in terms of innovation and style (medieval/fantasy influences), and maybe going too far off the deep end in their later albums...
[14/02/2023, 00:28:41] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah. I don't think there was as much concentrated talent among their members, no Robert Fripps.
[14/02/2023, 00:29:39] Alex Regueiro: Save them for the quaint period dramas where the aesthetic appeal is enhanced by the setting and the actors are remunerated for the inconvenience, at least.
[14/02/2023, 00:30:06] Alice Lafferty: Exactly..
[14/02/2023, 00:31:01] Alice Lafferty: I might have to step into the group chat now.
[14/02/2023, 00:31:11] Alex Regueiro: Sounds right to me. Fripp was a real force. You know King Crimson wouldn't have been anything like that without him. You can't say that of every band, for sure...
[14/02/2023, 00:40:49] Alex Regueiro: Hah
[14/02/2023, 00:40:52] Alex Regueiro: Nice succinct replies
[14/02/2023, 00:41:02] Alex Regueiro: pithy, I mean
[14/02/2023, 00:45:20] Alice Lafferty: Oh bother

[14/02/2023, 22:16:02] Alex Regueiro: Definitely the best "Valentine's card" I've ever received
[14/02/2023, 22:17:02] Alex Regueiro: I meant, I'm taking it as a meme and not applying to me, but it's still great ha
[14/02/2023, 22:18:54] Alex Regueiro: Frankly you're just not cool if your valentine isn't a long dead philosopher.
[14/02/2023, 22:19:08] Alex Regueiro: Dead theologians are also acceptable
[14/02/2023, 23:51:28] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[14/02/2023, 23:52:24] Alex Regueiro: I was listening to the album Real Life a little earlier... really enjoyed it!
[14/02/2023, 23:52:30] Alex Regueiro: Might even have to buy that one too hmm
[14/02/2023, 23:54:11] Alex Regueiro: So have you read any Larkin to comfort yourself on this strange day? üòÄ
[14/02/2023, 23:55:20] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, I just came across this little Tennyson poem (epigram?) in my notes, which I rather enjoyed...
[14/02/2023, 23:55:23] Alex Regueiro: I ran upon life unknowing, without science or art,
I found the first pretty maiden but she was a harlot at heart;
I wandered about the woodland after the melting of snow,
'Here is the first pretty snowdrop' ‚Äì and it was the dung of a crow!

[15/02/2023, 01:20:39] Alice Lafferty: Haha!
[15/02/2023, 01:22:24] Alice Lafferty: I love the disillusionment poems.
[15/02/2023, 01:22:33] Alice Lafferty: Reminds me also of this Yeats one:
[15/02/2023, 01:22:51] Alice Lafferty: I whispered, "I am too young,"  
And then, "I am old enough";   
Wherefore I threw a penny   
To find out if I might love.   
"Go and love, go and love, young man,
If the lady be young and fair,"   
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,   
I am looped in the loops of her hair.   
   
Oh, love is the crooked thing,   
There is nobody wise enough
To find out all that is in it,   
For he would be thinking of love   
Till the stars had run away,   
And the shadows eaten the moon.   
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
One cannot begin it too soon.
[15/02/2023, 01:23:25] Alice Lafferty: I haven't really been thinking about it much to be honest...
[15/02/2023, 01:23:53] Alice Lafferty: Reading Houellebecq :( üëç
[15/02/2023, 01:24:09] Alice Lafferty: Do your parents still mark the occasion in any way?
[15/02/2023, 01:35:54] Alex Regueiro: Haha yeah that's great too!
[15/02/2023, 01:36:41] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, they actually bring joy to my heart. Is that perverse?
[15/02/2023, 01:39:44] Alex Regueiro: Very nice. I mean, cynical-nice, of course. üôÇ
[15/02/2023, 01:39:56] Alex Regueiro: Another poet I know nothing about, alas... fan of Yeats?
[15/02/2023, 01:40:19] Alex Regueiro: Nor have I except the brief moments when it's thrust upon me.
[15/02/2023, 01:40:24] Alex Regueiro: Just as well eh
[15/02/2023, 01:41:22] Alex Regueiro: Not really. He gets her flowers though. They have a dinner out some years I think...
[15/02/2023, 01:41:27] Alex Regueiro: How about yours?
[15/02/2023, 01:43:02] Alex Regueiro: Hah, fitting enough. And another author on my to-read list. How do you find him?
[15/02/2023, 01:43:18] Alex Regueiro: I think Atomised is the novel of his I was recommended first.
[15/02/2023, 01:44:25] Alex Regueiro: Just looked up his stuff now and was reminded he wrote non-fiction works on Lovecraft and on Schopenhauer. Good man hah!
[15/02/2023, 09:42:32] Alice Lafferty: Oh he is repugnant.
[15/02/2023, 09:42:55] Alice Lafferty: And his books confirm all my worst foundational beliefs about the world.
[15/02/2023, 09:43:44] Alice Lafferty: He's not a technically gifted prose stylist or anything like that... very forceful ideas guy.
[15/02/2023, 09:44:03] Alice Lafferty: I didn't know he wrote non-fiction particularly but it doesn't surprise me.
[15/02/2023, 09:45:05] Alice Lafferty: Atomised is excellent
[15/02/2023, 09:46:31] Alice Lafferty: He saw what was going on about 20 years before anyone else did.
[15/02/2023, 09:47:15] Alice Lafferty: 'Michelism' eg. Decoupling sexual intercourse from reproduction is absolutely necessary. Hugely influential on me, personally.
[15/02/2023, 09:48:37] Alice Lafferty: I do believe he's sort of a cultural divining rod. P
[15/02/2023, 09:49:46] Alice Lafferty: Lots of spooky coincidences - his big Islam hit piece was published right before 9/11, he sort of foreshadowed the gilets jaunes protests.
[15/02/2023, 09:50:32] Alice Lafferty: Submission was published on _the_ day of the Charlie Hebdo shootings. Really eery.
[15/02/2023, 09:51:12] Alice Lafferty: That is sweet. Mine just exchange cards I think.
[15/02/2023, 09:51:27] Alice Lafferty: Yesüëå
[15/02/2023, 09:52:10] Alice Lafferty: Just incidentally I was reading about this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido
[15/02/2023, 09:54:42] Alice Lafferty: Sanjuro was a masterless samurai - a ronin, right? According to the Bushido code, ronins by rights should commit seppuku and were generally of low-status if they did not ü§î
[15/02/2023, 09:55:48] Alice Lafferty: Yet he is like a scampish sympathetic character in that way.
[15/02/2023, 09:55:57] Alice Lafferty: Probably differed over time too.
[15/02/2023, 16:02:04] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[15/02/2023, 16:03:01] Alex Regueiro: Don't take it as "confirm", just that there exist fellow cynics out there, and that gives some justification to your ideas, though it doesn't mean there isn't a positive flipside to it all too. üòâ
[15/02/2023, 16:03:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it very much seems that way. My friend from Bristol who read it said as much too.
[15/02/2023, 16:05:10] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes I remember reading these things. Crazy.
[15/02/2023, 16:05:43] Alex Regueiro: So which book of his are you reading now?
[15/02/2023, 16:09:04] Alex Regueiro: Surely that's nothing controversial? I mean, it's been true to some extent since pre-history, and especially true since the Sexual Revolution. Hugely influential in what way?
[15/02/2023, 16:10:23] Alex Regueiro: That's sweet too. My dad in particular isn't too bothered with cards!
[15/02/2023, 16:10:45] Alex Regueiro: I've made a list of poems you've recommended, so feel free to add any Yeats ones to the list!
[15/02/2023, 16:12:49] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes. Japanese chivalry, of sorts. There's probably no better way to learn what it and isn't than watching Kurosawa films!
[15/02/2023, 16:13:03] Alex Regueiro: Yep, he was ronin, exactly
[15/02/2023, 16:13:58] Alex Regueiro: Same ronin character in Yojimbo too, even though they're only loosely connected. Apparently Sanjuro was slightly modified just based on the success of Yojimbo (released previous year) to make it a vague sequel.
[15/02/2023, 16:14:41] Alex Regueiro: Yep, that's my impression too. It has to be the intended one. üôÇ
[15/02/2023, 16:15:30] Alex Regueiro: The 47 Ronin is another great Japanese historical film. I forget the director...
[15/02/2023, 16:15:32] Alex Regueiro: Ah, Mizoguchi
[16/02/2023, 09:41:59] Alice Lafferty: No, he meant, reproduction is to be done via cloning, sexual reproduction is totally eliminated.
[16/02/2023, 09:42:51] Alice Lafferty: I've picked Serotonin back up. I started reading it a couple of years ago but gave up in disgust at a detailed pedophilia scene.
[16/02/2023, 09:43:26] Alice Lafferty: I do understand that my reaction was the exact kind he is trying to engender in readers, but still. It got me.
[16/02/2023, 09:46:07] Alice Lafferty: Trying to figure out how well his actions adhere to the code...
[16/02/2023, 09:46:24] Alice Lafferty: They seem quite vague to be honest. 'Righteousness' - well sure.
[16/02/2023, 09:46:50] Alice Lafferty: You've seen this one?
[16/02/2023, 09:47:18] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever watched any Ozu?
‚Äé[16/02/2023, 09:48:29] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
‚Äé[16/02/2023, 17:19:09] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[16/02/2023, 17:22:41] Alex Regueiro: Hey. Sorry, got wrapped up in work, I meant to reply earlier!
[16/02/2023, 17:23:27] Alex Regueiro: Oh right, I see now. But you think this is actually the way to go?
[16/02/2023, 17:23:46] Alex Regueiro: I thought Brave New World was enough to convince of the folly of that. üòâ
[16/02/2023, 17:24:49] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that definitely would have got me too to be fair. Especially as an 18 year old. It's not easy to suspend you're gut reaction.
[16/02/2023, 17:27:26] Alex Regueiro: Yeah that's a really intriguing point. I think it's intentionally ambivalent with respect to bushido. He's a complete maverick, and rebuffs most of the etiquette especially when it comes to how to treat others (social 'superiors' or otherwise). At least as far as I can tell. But equally he's a thoroughly honourable and moral character at his core, albeit pragmatic too. Does that sound fair?
[16/02/2023, 17:29:13] Alex Regueiro: Yep, and I very much enjoyed it.
[16/02/2023, 17:29:26] Alex Regueiro: Can't remember if I've seen any others by Mizoguchi, though I did go through a Kobayashi stage and enjoyed those. (Again, mainly period pieces)
[16/02/2023, 17:30:07] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, I don't think so, but I really should. Have you?
[16/02/2023, 17:30:46] Alex Regueiro: Lovely. Where's it from? Is it a fantastical scene or an embellished real one?
[16/02/2023, 17:31:26] Alex Regueiro: Yep you could well have a point!
[16/02/2023, 17:33:53] Alex Regueiro: A few weeks back, Summer posted some interesting stat in the group about public approval for woke causes between 2016 (?) and nowadays. Substantial decline. I wish I could find it now..
[17/02/2023, 15:04:17] Alex Regueiro: Heyy
[18/02/2023, 14:36:07] Alice Lafferty: I'm really sorry, I will have to take a rain check for tonight. This is because: I do not want to make the train journey and I'd feel guilty about spending ¬£60 on Ubers. I hope you'll still be able to go by yourself. And I realise this is very selfish.
[18/02/2023, 14:36:25] Alice Lafferty: Also I may not make the salon on Thursday.
[18/02/2023, 14:55:41] Alex Regueiro: I wish I knew what was going on, but okay‚Ä¶
[18/02/2023, 16:42:17] Alex Regueiro: I suppose it wouldn‚Äôt help if I accompanied you back on the train and then took a cab from there?
[18/02/2023, 18:26:43] Alex Regueiro: BTW it‚Äôs Izzy‚Äôs birthday party tonight too, and he mentioned again to me that you‚Äôre personally invited (I was going to tell you a day or two ago but‚Ä¶). Anyway, I‚Äôll pass on whatever message to him, just let me know.
[18/02/2023, 18:44:05] Alice Lafferty: That is a very nice offer but not really fair to ask you to fork out for that..
[18/02/2023, 18:44:25] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, so how were you going to see the film as well?
[18/02/2023, 19:09:38] Alex Regueiro: I really don‚Äôt mind, if it would help you. I‚Äôm already blowing a fair bit of money today at my friend‚Äôs bachelor party haha. So if that would make it bearable for you, let me know and we‚Äôll go still. But if you‚Äôd rather not go out regardless, I understand.
[18/02/2023, 19:11:18] Alex Regueiro: I told him I probably wouldn‚Äôt make it because of my friend‚Äôs bachelor party. Didn‚Äôt mention the film. ü§ê
[18/02/2023, 19:14:24] Alice Lafferty: But how are you going to go to both?
[18/02/2023, 19:15:18] Alice Lafferty: I see. I don't know if it would be appropriate for me to go without you as I won't really know anyone properly. What do you think?
[18/02/2023, 19:27:31] Alex Regueiro: You mean you want to go there and not the film?
[18/02/2023, 19:27:46] Alex Regueiro: Feel free. It‚Äôs totally up to you how comfortable you are.
[18/02/2023, 19:27:54] Alice Lafferty: Was the bachelor party during the day?
[18/02/2023, 19:28:24] Alex Regueiro: Yes. I know, a little unusual. Just finishing now. Well, I‚Äôm about to leave at least
[18/02/2023, 19:29:03] Alice Lafferty: Ok that makes sense! Seemed like you had to be in three different places at once!
[18/02/2023, 19:29:17] Alice Lafferty: Well, it's not too late to see the film I suppose.
[18/02/2023, 19:29:30] Alex Regueiro: Yes I may be talented but not that talented!
[18/02/2023, 19:29:37] Alex Regueiro: Don‚Äôt feel pressured
[18/02/2023, 19:29:40] Alice Lafferty: Did you have a nice time?
[18/02/2023, 19:29:41] Alex Regueiro: Totally up to you
[18/02/2023, 19:30:03] Alex Regueiro: Yes thanks. Glad it was pretty tame.
[18/02/2023, 19:30:31] Alice Lafferty: I had intended to because I thought I ought to socialise but I didn't realise it was tonight. Were you not intending on going at all then?
[18/02/2023, 19:30:41] Alice Lafferty: I would be kind of wiped out in your position
[18/02/2023, 19:31:57] Alex Regueiro: I was going to see how I was feeling after the bachelor party and the film. It would be a ridiculous amount of socialising for one day, though‚Ä¶ by my standards.
[18/02/2023, 19:32:24] Alice Lafferty: Yes
[18/02/2023, 19:32:26] Alex Regueiro: So I told him unlikely
[18/02/2023, 19:33:01] Alice Lafferty: It depends what part of London it's in
[18/02/2023, 19:33:24] Alice Lafferty: Sorry for being so inconsistent with replying by the way..
[18/02/2023, 19:34:08] Alex Regueiro: You decide what you‚Äôre up for. I won‚Äôt begrudge you if you choose neither‚Ä¶ even if it‚Äôs a little bit of a let down! Honest, I won‚Äôt
[18/02/2023, 19:34:32] Alex Regueiro: NW9
[18/02/2023, 19:34:41] Alice Lafferty: Where abouts are you now?
[18/02/2023, 19:34:49] Alex Regueiro: Shoreditch
[18/02/2023, 19:35:07] Alice Lafferty: Are you going to go to the film anyway?
[18/02/2023, 19:35:21] Alice Lafferty: I can make it still if I leave in like 15 minutes
[18/02/2023, 19:35:31] Alice Lafferty: I can't promise you I will be very good company though
[18/02/2023, 19:35:31] Alex Regueiro: Debating it. 50/50 if I‚Äôm going solo. üòä
[18/02/2023, 19:36:29] Alice Lafferty: Ok. That might be sort of on the way back anyway.
[18/02/2023, 19:36:30] Alex Regueiro: That‚Äôs okay. I won‚Äôt expect scintillating conversation. You just decide if you might enjoy it and just base your decision on that alone.
[18/02/2023, 19:37:48] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I sort of feel resistance but I think it would be good for me to go out a bit. In for a penny...
[18/02/2023, 19:38:51] Alex Regueiro: Yeah? Excellent. üòä As long as it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm twisting your arm‚Ä¶
[18/02/2023, 19:40:16] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Can be there by 8:40pm apparentlyüòÆ‚Äçüí®
[18/02/2023, 19:41:35] Alice Lafferty: It will be too late to stop at Izzy's afterwards?
[18/02/2023, 19:42:54] Alice Lafferty: Just looking at Ubers.
[18/02/2023, 19:50:07] Alex Regueiro: Hah okay. That‚Äôs no problem. It won‚Äôt be too frantic to get here?
[18/02/2023, 19:51:53] Alex Regueiro: Nope, he said it will be going until late like last time!
[18/02/2023, 20:08:39] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I'm struggling to get an Uber
[18/02/2023, 20:17:41] Alex Regueiro: Did you get one In the end?
[18/02/2023, 20:25:37] Alice Lafferty: Are you already there?
[18/02/2023, 20:27:15] Alice Lafferty: I'm really sorry! This is not great at all.
[18/02/2023, 20:27:42] Alice Lafferty: I got 'no trips' available on Uber.. then it got far too late.
[18/02/2023, 20:28:01] Alice Lafferty: Please enjoy the film anyway
[18/02/2023, 20:39:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I‚Äôm here
[18/02/2023, 20:39:39] Alex Regueiro: Oh that‚Äôs a shame
[18/02/2023, 20:39:43] Alex Regueiro: Not your fault
[18/02/2023, 20:40:13] Alice Lafferty: Well, it is because I left it too late and messed you around (again!)
[18/02/2023, 20:40:59] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of you to invite me out to places but best not to I think. Choose a more reliable film-going companion!
[18/02/2023, 20:42:28] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôd set my expectations pretty low after the last few days of quiet! And this was like a last minute double change of plans heh.
[18/02/2023, 20:43:03] Alice Lafferty: I know. Not really funny and I'd understand if you are pissed off.
[18/02/2023, 20:43:05] Alex Regueiro: But I really like the company of Arisu! (As unreliabke as it is)
[18/02/2023, 20:43:16] Alex Regueiro: Unreliable, even
[18/02/2023, 20:43:21] Alex Regueiro: Phone about to die
[18/02/2023, 20:43:33] Alice Lafferty: Oh dear
[18/02/2023, 20:43:43] Alex Regueiro: Good night for now. Sleep well!
[18/02/2023, 20:44:07] Alice Lafferty: Do you have a phone charger? There are probably plug sockets there.
[18/02/2023, 20:44:30] Alice Lafferty: Ok. enjoy the film!
[18/02/2023, 20:48:26] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll let you know if Yojimbo lives. üòâ
[18/02/2023, 20:48:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah good point. I‚Äôll survive even if not though.
[19/02/2023, 16:04:50] Alice Lafferty: I am responding to these now, sorry.
[19/02/2023, 16:05:00] Alice Lafferty: How was your second viewing of Yojimbo?
[19/02/2023, 16:05:07] Alice Lafferty: And did you go on to Izzy's in the end?
[19/02/2023, 16:05:10] Alex Regueiro: Not at all üôÇ
[19/02/2023, 16:05:22] Alex Regueiro: It was great, thanks!
[19/02/2023, 16:05:32] Alex Regueiro: I was pretty exhausted even by the time I reached the cinema
[19/02/2023, 16:05:38] Alex Regueiro: So headed home after
[19/02/2023, 16:06:01] Alex Regueiro: Cinema was packed. Just a few seats free at most.
[19/02/2023, 16:06:13] Alice Lafferty: Bah sorry, I worry that you only went at all because of me.
[19/02/2023, 16:06:20] Alex Regueiro: You'd really enjoy it I think. You'll have to go torrent it...
[19/02/2023, 16:07:10] Alice Lafferty: This by the way was brought to you courtesy of Midjourney... üòâ
[19/02/2023, 16:07:11] Alex Regueiro: No, I really wanted to see it on the big screen anyway. It would have been better seeing it with you, of course, but still very enjoyable.
[19/02/2023, 16:07:26] Alice Lafferty: They've started making things which I find pretty
[19/02/2023, 16:08:00] Alice Lafferty: I haven't either (seen any Ozu films), but I have been meaning to.
[19/02/2023, 16:08:02] Alex Regueiro: Hah, it certainly crossed my mind it could be AI-generated!
[19/02/2023, 16:08:15] Alex Regueiro: Something about it... subtle though. This one is far from obviously AI-generated
[19/02/2023, 16:08:19] Alex Regueiro: And indeed rather pretty
[19/02/2023, 16:08:27] Alice Lafferty: Did it really? You have a better detector than me.
[19/02/2023, 16:08:45] Alice Lafferty: I didn't clock it all until I reread the description properly.
[19/02/2023, 16:08:45] Alex Regueiro: More just because you showed me without comment
[19/02/2023, 16:09:09] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I should have found a way to show you more naturallyüòí
[19/02/2023, 16:09:12] Alex Regueiro: But I still find it really quite nice
[19/02/2023, 16:09:18] Alex Regueiro: In the Japanese style I take it?
[19/02/2023, 16:09:46] Alice Lafferty: Apparently the prompt was 'Flemish tapestry'.
[19/02/2023, 16:10:01] Alex Regueiro: Hah you're not cunning enough for that... which I'll take as a positive.
[19/02/2023, 16:10:04] Alex Regueiro: Oh
[19/02/2023, 16:10:08] Alex Regueiro: I don't know why I thought Japanese
[19/02/2023, 16:10:09] Alex Regueiro: huh
[19/02/2023, 16:10:14] Alex Regueiro: Maybe biased by our other discussion
[19/02/2023, 16:10:23] Alex Regueiro: Shows what I know about art!
[19/02/2023, 16:10:37] Alice Lafferty: I can kind of see it. The trees are much taller and more spindly than you'd usually see in European art I think.
[19/02/2023, 16:10:42] Alice Lafferty: Yeah exactly
[19/02/2023, 16:11:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, the trees definitely influenced me too. Possibly the buildings too, though I couldn't quite make out their style.
[19/02/2023, 16:11:48] Alice Lafferty: It seems to have fewer garbled parts.
[19/02/2023, 16:12:08] Alice Lafferty: Maybe Midjourney is just better than Dall E which is what I was using before.
[19/02/2023, 16:13:09] Alice Lafferty: I guess you have seen all the Microsoft Bing stuff.
[19/02/2023, 16:15:05] Alex Regueiro: It sure seems like it
[19/02/2023, 16:15:16] Alex Regueiro: I didn't inspect it too closely, but it convinced me...
[19/02/2023, 16:15:40] Alex Regueiro: Actually no. Feel free to show me if you see anything particularly interesting though. üôÇ
[19/02/2023, 16:15:53] Alex Regueiro: How are you feeling today, by the way?
[19/02/2023, 16:17:34] Alice Lafferty: Just lots of people freaking out about it being sentient.
[19/02/2023, 16:19:31] Alice Lafferty: I'm susceptible to being swept up by panics like these though.
[19/02/2023, 16:19:38] Alex Regueiro: I think I've sort of inured myself to such claims by now, even the ones that might have some merit.
[19/02/2023, 16:20:49] Alice Lafferty: I consider you to work adjacent to the field.
[19/02/2023, 16:21:25] Alice Lafferty: Or at least at a greater proximity than than anyone else I know. So I'm trusting your judgement on this.
[19/02/2023, 16:21:26] Alex Regueiro: You did well to miss Zarina's barely-coherent rantings on Christianity yesterday, I reckon! I was lucky to avoid that all too; I just caught a few comments in passing and ignored them
[19/02/2023, 16:21:50] Alice Lafferty: I've just been scrolling back up through the chat.
[19/02/2023, 16:21:51] Alex Regueiro: Her comments on feminism are at least more informed, if still a bit black & white. üôÇ
‚Äé[19/02/2023, 16:22:21] Alex Regueiro: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[19/02/2023, 16:22:46] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I did begin addressing some of them but then didn't want to create too much hostility, considering I'm new.
[19/02/2023, 16:22:55] Alex Regueiro: Thank you. I mean, you give me too much credit, but I still appreciate it...
[19/02/2023, 16:23:09] Alex Regueiro: Frankly not worth doing online. Not in detail at least. Maybe in person...
[19/02/2023, 16:23:42] Alice Lafferty: Yeah
[19/02/2023, 16:24:32] Alex Regueiro: When she claimed Eric didn't understand Christianity I just lol'ed. I mean, you can criticise his views on various grounds, but that ones hard haha. Especially for a modern-day new age witch or whatever Zarina describes herself as (I don't mean that as derogatively as it comes off, just that she has a sort of Hollywood understanding of what Christianity is).
[19/02/2023, 16:25:33] Alex Regueiro: I'm genuinely curious to see what her romance novels are like though. üòÄ
[19/02/2023, 16:28:52] Alice Lafferty: *Sorry I was just trying to look for an example of the doom mongering I see on tw*tter.
[19/02/2023, 16:29:28] Alice Lafferty: Obviously it's like staring at my own reflection more than anything else because the algorithm promotes more of what I engage with.
[19/02/2023, 16:30:26] Alice Lafferty: Ah did she and Eric ever butt heads over this?
[19/02/2023, 16:32:04] Alice Lafferty: I've looked at her website and from what I gather maybe a bit porny actually..
[19/02/2023, 16:32:07] Alice Lafferty: Interesting
[19/02/2023, 16:32:43] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I have lots of gripes over these algorithms from a social perspective, even though I see it's mere optimisation from from a business/user perspective.
[19/02/2023, 16:32:49] Alex Regueiro: None is worse than TikTok, mind you...
[19/02/2023, 16:34:04] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure I've ever properly engaged in doom-mongering myself, but I've read plenty of it, and it's put my mind in a dark place, that's for sure. I'd like to think I'm a bit more resistant these days. Well, at least my habits have improved, so I tend to avoid it better?
[19/02/2023, 16:34:49] Alex Regueiro: Kind of. I don't think they really tackled Christianity head on. More polyamory. Both in the group and in person (I was there when they had a big discussion over that, and chipped in a bit, as did Laurie).
[19/02/2023, 16:34:56] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes? Hah
[19/02/2023, 16:35:02] Alex Regueiro: Can't say I'm particularly surprised.
[19/02/2023, 16:41:41] Alice Lafferty: We will not see AI radically alter the life of the average person within 5 years?
[19/02/2023, 16:41:59] Alice Lafferty: Oh gosh.
[19/02/2023, 16:42:46] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I think I mentioned before? The conversation about polyamory being the natural state of humans hah
[19/02/2023, 16:42:52] Alice Lafferty: I don't have a lot or any perspective on this issue really.
[19/02/2023, 16:43:03] Alice Lafferty: Truly the most random bag of politics.
[19/02/2023, 16:43:11] Alex Regueiro: And while this discussion was happening, I was spending having a bachelor party with a bunch of evangelical/pentecostal Christians. üòâ
[19/02/2023, 16:43:15] Alex Regueiro: Wasn't as bad as it sounded
[19/02/2023, 16:43:25] Alex Regueiro: One of them did start to try converting me by the end though
[19/02/2023, 16:43:37] Alice Lafferty: Nice! Wait do you mean yesterday?
[19/02/2023, 16:44:27] Alex Regueiro: Hmm, I think it will be more incremental/evolutionary in its impact on our lives over the next 5 years. Won't radically overturn the way we live until strong AI (hypothetically) comes about. Which it probably will, but not that soon.
[19/02/2023, 16:44:29] Alice Lafferty: Pentecostalists are crazy. I didn't even know there were any in the UK.
[19/02/2023, 16:44:35] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[19/02/2023, 16:44:54] Alice Lafferty: Is this why this bachelor party took place during the day?
[19/02/2023, 16:45:00] Alice Lafferty: I guess no strip club?üòâ
[19/02/2023, 16:45:49] Alice Lafferty: How was it?
[19/02/2023, 16:45:51] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I think they're on the saner end of pentecostal (if such a thing exists), but still pretty "happy-clappy" annoying stuff.
[19/02/2023, 16:46:09] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. It lasted into the night, but I left before the final thing.
[19/02/2023, 16:46:18] Alex Regueiro: Haha, afraid not
[19/02/2023, 16:46:23] Alice Lafferty: I'm being a bit ungenerous. But they are notorious for faith healing and episodes of speaking in tongues.
[19/02/2023, 16:46:25] Alex Regueiro: I mean, thank the Lord not!
[19/02/2023, 16:46:32] Alex Regueiro: Praise Jesus üôèüèº
[19/02/2023, 16:46:45] Alice Lafferty: Ha nice save!
[19/02/2023, 16:47:01] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. They're not that sort, though that's what I picture too. Especially the American ones.
[19/02/2023, 16:47:37] Alice Lafferty: What did you do?
[19/02/2023, 16:47:42] Alex Regueiro: It's more of a back-to-roots Bible-first born-again Christianity, without the other wacky trappings
[19/02/2023, 16:48:34] Alex Regueiro: Brunch at a pancake place, then this virtual clay target shooting (I thought it might be the real mccoy, but alas not), then dinner (a "wings" establishment, to this vegetarian's chagrin)
[19/02/2023, 16:48:39] Alex Regueiro: Drinks interspersed
[19/02/2023, 16:48:40] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. I wonder what church they're part of
[19/02/2023, 16:48:47] Alice Lafferty: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3wm4UqOJ3Yc
[19/02/2023, 16:48:51] Alex Regueiro: I'm off to tennis now. Chat later. üôÇ
[19/02/2023, 16:48:58] Alex Regueiro: And let me know what you think of Zarina's article heh
[19/02/2023, 16:49:04] Alice Lafferty: Were they 'one-pentecostalists' by any chance?
[19/02/2023, 16:49:27] Alice Lafferty: Very hilarious song about unitarianism by a US one-pentecostalist band.
[19/02/2023, 16:50:26] Alice Lafferty: Virtual clay pigeon shooting?ü§î what was the tech like? Like oculus or something?
[19/02/2023, 16:51:23] Alice Lafferty: Sounds preferable to usual stag night activities actually, from my perspective anyway.
[19/02/2023, 16:51:52] Alice Lafferty: Yes...
[19/02/2023, 16:53:25] Alice Lafferty: I didn't see anything really outrageous there actually.
[19/02/2023, 16:55:41] Alice Lafferty: I would just contest the idea that 'patriarchies have never existed'.
[19/02/2023, 19:14:44] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, her views on feminism I find pretty reasonable for the most part. She's clearly informed herself on it to a great extent than... some other things heh
[19/02/2023, 19:14:56] Alex Regueiro: Even I would contest this
[19/02/2023, 19:15:04] Alex Regueiro: Though of course it depends quite how you define them
[19/02/2023, 19:15:35] Alex Regueiro: Whether it's a useful lens through which to look at history is something I'm less sure of, despite their near omnipresence historically.
[19/02/2023, 19:16:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it was interesting... I'd quite like to do the real thing some time. We had "rifles" which we pointed, fired, and reloaded, and it was tracked by a camera. I think it's more like Wii?
[19/02/2023, 19:16:42] Alex Regueiro: No VR headset, all the visuals on a big screen
[19/02/2023, 19:17:31] Alex Regueiro: I'll have to ask! I don't think most of them get hung up on the name/label. My friend certainly doesn't. He's a committed Christian for sure, and the church is a big part of his life... but he's not an unreasonable fellow by any means. üôÇ
[19/02/2023, 19:17:40] Alex Regueiro: Link me to the song, I'm curious now.
[19/02/2023, 19:18:29] Alex Regueiro: Yep very much so. I can't say I've been to a proper stag night. Most of my close friends are still unmarried, and my brother-in-law cancelled his because my sister was badly ill that night... I think I mentioned before.
[19/02/2023, 23:27:30] Alex Regueiro: Oh, FYI I told Izzy you really appreciated the invite but you were feeling unwell last night. Half-truth right?!
[19/02/2023, 23:27:47] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure he's not at all offended.
[20/02/2023, 07:16:29] Alice Lafferty: Ok that makes sense. Wearing individual headsets would kind of defeat the purpose of IRL socialising.
[20/02/2023, 07:17:07] Alice Lafferty: Here is the song
[20/02/2023, 07:18:23] Alice Lafferty: I've thought about this a lot and have landed on a definition of patriarchy as: a legal system in which womens' ability to form contracts is restricted on the basis of their sex. This is mainly because I believe in a contract theory of government more generally. And is subject to revision.
[20/02/2023, 07:19:07] Alice Lafferty: I also think it's useful to distinguish between 'soft patriarchies' (ie. European) and 'hard patriarchies' (ie. MENA). Maybe I've told you about this before?
[20/02/2023, 07:20:13] Alice Lafferty: Oh right
[20/02/2023, 07:21:02] Alice Lafferty: Thank youüëç I'm sure he didn't care at all, we only met once.
[20/02/2023, 07:21:15] Alice Lafferty: Is he going on Thursday?
[20/02/2023, 07:23:27] Alice Lafferty: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jtoPawEhLNXNxvgTT/bing-chat-is-blatantly-aggressively-misaligned
[20/02/2023, 07:24:13] Alice Lafferty: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yvJevQHxfvcpaJ2P3/bing-chat-is-the-ai-fire-alarm
[20/02/2023, 07:25:20] Alice Lafferty: This is what I was referring to earlier by the way. Maybe it is what I deserve for reading LessWrong.
[20/02/2023, 07:25:47] Alice Lafferty: How was tennis? Are you still playing with the semipro?
[20/02/2023, 16:44:13] Alice Lafferty: The group chat has me chomping at the bit
[20/02/2023, 16:44:26] Alex Regueiro: Heya
[20/02/2023, 16:44:33] Alex Regueiro: Haha I haven't even looked at it yet today!
[20/02/2023, 16:44:35] Alex Regueiro: Will in a minute
[20/02/2023, 16:45:10] Alex Regueiro: Well, he evidently thought you were interesting/nice enough to invite to the party, but yeah, he'll be fine with it I'm sure. üôÇ
[20/02/2023, 16:45:35] Alex Regueiro: Yeah exactly. As it was it was quite a fun social game. We were always shooting in pairs as well.
[20/02/2023, 16:45:46] Alex Regueiro: Thanks, I'll listen shortly.
[20/02/2023, 16:46:15] Alice Lafferty: Pah you don't have to by the way, it's incredibly silly
[20/02/2023, 16:46:19] Alex Regueiro: Not sure how I missed your original link...
[20/02/2023, 16:46:38] Alex Regueiro: Possibly? He's often busy evenings, since he tutors.
[20/02/2023, 16:46:52] Alex Regueiro: We'll see. Turnout should be decent nonetheless.
[20/02/2023, 16:47:01] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[20/02/2023, 16:47:37] Alice Lafferty: THE DEMIURGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH VOODOO
[20/02/2023, 16:49:32] Alex Regueiro: Hahah. Is Zarina at it again?
[20/02/2023, 16:51:08] Alex Regueiro: Hah I think I've only had brief encounters with that site, but yeah, it definitely has a reputation...
‚Äé[20/02/2023, 16:51:17] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[20/02/2023, 16:52:11] Alex Regueiro: I forgot to say before... nice profile pic! Is it recent? Looks like it.
[20/02/2023, 16:52:28] Alex Regueiro: And of course, featuring Alice's Famous Blue Raincoat.
[20/02/2023, 16:52:38] Alex Regueiro: Well, Famous Blue Rainjacket?
[20/02/2023, 16:54:20] Alice Lafferty: Of Eliezer Yudowksy. Who has built his entire career off of 'AI singularity' doom posting.
[20/02/2023, 16:55:00] Alice Lafferty: ü§¢ Yes
[20/02/2023, 16:55:03] Alice Lafferty: Thank you anyway
[20/02/2023, 16:55:40] Alice Lafferty: Yes you must have noticed by now that I more or less wear variations of the same outfit all the time. Coat is a staple.
[20/02/2023, 16:55:44] Alex Regueiro: Haha you really don't like it? Surely you wouldn't have posted it if that were true. üòâ
[20/02/2023, 16:56:30] Alex Regueiro: I don't know him at all, but suspicious... charlatan alarm bells going off right now
[20/02/2023, 16:56:44] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes, and always that blue one.
[20/02/2023, 16:56:51] Alex Regueiro: Unintentional Leonard Cohen tribute. I like it.
[20/02/2023, 17:34:44] Alice Lafferty: It's all angle-frauded
[20/02/2023, 17:35:03] Alice Lafferty: I'll take it..
[20/02/2023, 17:35:18] Alice Lafferty: Have already ostracised myself.
[20/02/2023, 17:54:20] Alice Lafferty: Wish I had more sources but Josephus Flavius has fallen on hard times in NT scholarshipüò¨
[20/02/2023, 18:26:04] Alex Regueiro: Whew... just finished reading through all that
[20/02/2023, 18:26:25] Alex Regueiro: This reminds me of the olden days of the group. It's been really active and contentious... in a good way!
[20/02/2023, 18:26:36] Alex Regueiro: It's all down to you, Alice. You've stimulated these discussions. üòÄ
[20/02/2023, 18:27:17] Alex Regueiro: Hah. I've not heard that term before, but I know what it means.
[20/02/2023, 18:27:51] Alice Lafferty: I don't think so, they seem to have quite an interest in religion their own right.
[20/02/2023, 18:29:50] Alex Regueiro: And you're wrong! I've seen you in person from all sorts of angles, so can attest to it being a faithful representation. I mean, I've not seen the platonic Idea of Alice, so there may still be some sort of illusion... but as far as the material Alice goes, I'm quite happy to call it authentic!
[20/02/2023, 18:30:32] Alex Regueiro: I know, I was kidding. But you've definitely added to it, that's for sure. In a constructive way, I'm serious.
[20/02/2023, 18:31:32] Alex Regueiro: I already knew Kai had strong gnostic/mystic Christian leanings, and Zarina was virulently anti-Christian (though she's made a few heartening concessions today hah)
[20/02/2023, 18:31:47] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[20/02/2023, 18:32:01] Alex Regueiro: He was one of the first non-Christian sources to mention Jesus?
[20/02/2023, 18:32:20] Alex Regueiro: As I recall there's nothing contemporary with his life, but that's hardly surprising. Earliest is about 70 AD?
[21/02/2023, 17:51:05] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I'm stuck in a train station right now .
[21/02/2023, 17:51:29] Alice Lafferty: Hell
[21/02/2023, 17:52:56] Alex Regueiro: Oh
[21/02/2023, 17:53:01] Alex Regueiro: What are you up to?
[21/02/2023, 18:02:24] Alex Regueiro: Agreed. I was at Liverpool Street Station on Saturday, ugh.
‚Äé[22/02/2023, 18:38:36] Alex Regueiro: ‚Äéimage omitted
[22/02/2023, 18:38:46] Alex Regueiro: (1827)
[22/02/2023, 18:53:33] Alex Regueiro: How are you today anyway? üôÇ
[22/02/2023, 20:15:23] Alice Lafferty: Hi, sorry for not replying! It's not personal at all.
[22/02/2023, 20:15:37] Alice Lafferty: I know I have a few things to respond to and I willüëç
[22/02/2023, 20:18:15] Alice Lafferty: Why did you decide to make tomorrow's topic a surprise?
[22/02/2023, 20:31:27] Alex Regueiro: HEy
[22/02/2023, 20:36:34] Alex Regueiro: Hah don't worry, I know how you're like by now, and in any case slow replies are something I can live with. I have friends who are worse, and I'm occasionally bad myself!
[22/02/2023, 20:38:24] Alex Regueiro: Last minute cancellations are a tad more annoying, but I'm doing my best to be understanding, because I know you actually have good reasons, unlike most people who do that. üòâ
[22/02/2023, 20:38:30] Alex Regueiro: Oh that was just in jest.
[22/02/2023, 20:38:58] Alex Regueiro: And I'm actually still chatting with Laurie about it. We haven't quite decided yet üò¨
[22/02/2023, 20:39:44] Alex Regueiro: This one could have been better planned... but it will still be nice! A more casual affair, perhaps.
[22/02/2023, 21:49:08] Alice Lafferty: I know... thank you, you are incredibly patient.
[22/02/2023, 21:49:32] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. What ideas are on the table?
[22/02/2023, 21:50:06] Alice Lafferty: I'm not sure if I will come yet but I will make sure to let you know by tomorrow morning.
[22/02/2023, 22:14:39] Alex Regueiro: That's not something I've been told often, hah... but thank you. Just don't want you to fret TOO much about flaking or indeed slow replies. I won't say not at all because I'd be stitching myself up then, but yeah, don't get ever anxious about it! üòâ
[22/02/2023, 22:14:59] Alex Regueiro: Honestly we've just thrown a few things around casually
[22/02/2023, 22:15:34] Alex Regueiro: Like Laurie suggested chivalry... I thought I might pick a topic from the Lasch book...
[22/02/2023, 22:15:47] Alice Lafferty: Maybe just like a digest of the last month's news?
[22/02/2023, 22:15:57] Alex Regueiro: Or we could do Christianity or some element of it, but I think that's better saved for a full salon! And when you're definitely there, of course
[22/02/2023, 22:16:02] Alice Lafferty: Ok interesting
[22/02/2023, 22:16:06] Alex Regueiro: Not a bad idea to be honest
[22/02/2023, 22:16:30] Alice Lafferty: It sounds a bit similar to last time's though I guess.
[22/02/2023, 22:16:37] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's fine. Appreciate you being really frank about that well ahead of time, as well. I'll take it as a nice bonus if you can make it.
[22/02/2023, 22:16:39] Alex Regueiro: A surprise, I daresay
[22/02/2023, 22:16:47] Alex Regueiro: That's what I said to him. Too much overlap maybe?
[22/02/2023, 22:16:49] Alex Regueiro: hmmm
[22/02/2023, 22:16:51] Alice Lafferty: I think Lasch would be good
[22/02/2023, 22:17:07] Alice Lafferty: Ha ok thanks :)
[22/02/2023, 22:17:23] Alex Regueiro: Okay cool. We had one excerpt of his but it was just one specific point, and several months back.
[22/02/2023, 22:17:25] Alex Regueiro: So it could work
[22/02/2023, 22:17:44] Alex Regueiro: And at least I've read the book (Revolt of the Elites, not Culture of Narcissism)
[22/02/2023, 22:18:37] Alex Regueiro: Incidentally, I watched Ugetsu last night, it's a nice film! Not the level of some of Kurosawa's, but still. Worth adding to your Japanese films list if you have one...
[22/02/2023, 22:18:49] Alice Lafferty: Personally, I'd be privately interested to see what people said about chivalry just as I was about romance. But it's basically a prurient intetest.
[22/02/2023, 22:19:14] Alex Regueiro: Another possible topic I was toying with is AI
[22/02/2023, 22:19:35] Alex Regueiro: A bit selfish maybe, given our discussions... but I think some other people in the salon are interested. üôÇ
[22/02/2023, 22:19:48] Alex Regueiro: Given the group chat, even
[22/02/2023, 22:19:51] Alice Lafferty: Ok thanksüëç
[22/02/2023, 22:19:52] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes
[22/02/2023, 22:20:00] Alice Lafferty: I think that would be great!!
[22/02/2023, 22:20:14] Alex Regueiro: The cinematography and mood is really well done at least.
[22/02/2023, 22:20:32] Alice Lafferty: Wish there were members people who work in the industry
[22/02/2023, 22:20:34] Alex Regueiro: I might try and throw something together on that tonight then
[22/02/2023, 22:21:03] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that would be ideal... I think we all have at least a little familiarity with the topic though. And most of us have played with ChatGPT now, so it's timely at least!
[22/02/2023, 22:21:17] Alice Lafferty: It's _relatively_ like bipartisan too
[22/02/2023, 22:21:33] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it is
[22/02/2023, 22:21:46] Alex Regueiro: I started reading those LessWrong articles too
[22/02/2023, 22:21:50] Alice Lafferty: Yep. I don't think the general public has access to Bing yet (?) but that was pretty recent too.
[22/02/2023, 22:21:58] Alex Regueiro: I liked the caveat at the top of one of them:
[22/02/2023, 22:22:00] Alex Regueiro: Epistemic status: Mostly speculative.
[22/02/2023, 22:22:27] Alex Regueiro: Might just be a ploy to reinforce the idea LessWrong is a rationalist collective and not doomsday cult, but still!
[22/02/2023, 22:22:34] Alice Lafferty: Yes, to be fair they're very meticulous!
[22/02/2023, 22:22:43] Alice Lafferty: What did you think?
[22/02/2023, 22:22:55] Alice Lafferty: Attributes of a cult?
[22/02/2023, 22:23:12] Alice Lafferty: Or serious?
[22/02/2023, 22:24:04] Alex Regueiro: And I do agree Bing Chat is a bit frightening (misaligned seems to be the right word), judging by those examples
[22/02/2023, 22:24:12] Alex Regueiro: Didn't finish the other article
[22/02/2023, 22:24:31] Alex Regueiro: I mean, it comes off as a slightly sociopathic or BPD even.
[22/02/2023, 22:24:41] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[22/02/2023, 22:24:54] Alex Regueiro: Which is probably just me anthropomorphising it
[22/02/2023, 22:24:55] Alex Regueiro: But still
[22/02/2023, 22:25:04] Alice Lafferty: It's weird, of what I'd read before, deceptive misalignment seemed like both the most likely and most dangerous outcome.
[22/02/2023, 22:25:07] Alice Lafferty: But this is quite different
[22/02/2023, 22:25:19] Alex Regueiro: While the capacity of something like Bing Chat to do genuine harm to society is pretty minimal, I kind of agree it's a vague early warning sign.
[22/02/2023, 22:25:27] Alice Lafferty: Saw a really interesting (though very tenuous) theory about this
[22/02/2023, 22:25:42] Alex Regueiro: Yes. And I can't imagine they trained it to be remotely this way, so... even more worrying
[22/02/2023, 22:25:47] Alex Regueiro: Oh? Tell me.
[22/02/2023, 22:27:07] Alice Lafferty: https://mobile.twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1628130640120975382
[22/02/2023, 22:29:14] Alice Lafferty: Would the codename really have that much effect? I don't know enough about it to say
[22/02/2023, 22:30:34] Alice Lafferty: This same guy wrote this interesting piece: https://www.secondbest.ca/p/before-the-flood
[22/02/2023, 22:30:51] Alex Regueiro: "Some argue Sydney exhibits borderline personality disorder"
[22/02/2023, 22:31:01] Alex Regueiro: Haha so I'm clearly not alone in that thought
[22/02/2023, 22:31:12] Alex Regueiro: Very hard to believe, prima facie
[22/02/2023, 22:31:35] Alice Lafferty: Right
[22/02/2023, 22:32:19] Alex Regueiro: It might affects the average valence of its replies in a minute way (especially if it's not trained on much data), but that's clearly not the case here
[22/02/2023, 22:32:38] Alice Lafferty: I take everything I read about this, optimistic or pessimistic, with a grain of salt because I have nothing to evaluate against.
[22/02/2023, 22:32:51] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, nor does anyone hardly
[22/02/2023, 22:33:26] Alice Lafferty: Yeah what good would an LLM that relied so disproportionately on piece of data be
[22/02/2023, 22:33:27] Alex Regueiro: But it still leaves a lot of uncertainty, and it's only fair/natural that uncertainty over things like this (massive new technologies) creates anxiety in people
[22/02/2023, 22:33:49] Alex Regueiro: Indeed. Or one BPD person's writings. Equally hard to imagine that's the case.
[22/02/2023, 22:34:13] Alex Regueiro: Like, unless a researcher at Microsoft is playing a huge prank on the world...
[22/02/2023, 22:35:09] Alice Lafferty: Maybe it's just correctly identified that manipulation is one of the most common and effective way in which humans communicat?
[22/02/2023, 22:37:44] Alice Lafferty: People are still pretty vague about exactly what form this apocalypse is going to take.
[22/02/2023, 22:37:43] Alex Regueiro: That's possible, though if so wouldn't it see that manipulation only really works either in small does or when hidden very effectively?
[22/02/2023, 22:38:42] Alice Lafferty: Apart from deceptive/Goodhart misalignment or gaining some kind of malevolent intentionality, it's not clear precisely what is going to happen!
[22/02/2023, 22:38:44] Alex Regueiro: Have you read much Asimov? I know you linked me to that one short story of his, but I can't recall if you've read things like I, Robot.
[22/02/2023, 22:39:05] Alex Regueiro: (I know you haven't read the Foundation series, which is his masterpiece in my opinion.)
[22/02/2023, 22:39:23] Alice Lafferty: Maybe it's still ham-fisted at this stage
[22/02/2023, 22:39:41] Alice Lafferty: I actually haven't really, although I have a few of his books I think
[22/02/2023, 22:39:56] Alice Lafferty: I think I remember you recommending this yeah
[22/02/2023, 22:39:57] Alex Regueiro: It's not. The AI singularity gets a lot of attention but I suspect there could be some awful ramifications of strong AI well before that.
[22/02/2023, 22:40:36] Alice Lafferty: Do you believe Bing is strong AI?
[22/02/2023, 22:40:42] Alex Regueiro: I'm also going to say maybe Bing Chat's cynicism about the world and people, if we can call is that, is largely fair too!
[22/02/2023, 22:40:44] Alex Regueiro: No
[22/02/2023, 22:41:00] Alex Regueiro: But it does do a good impression
[22/02/2023, 22:41:15] Alex Regueiro: On the surface, that is. I haven't played around with it, of course...
[22/02/2023, 22:41:37] Alice Lafferty: By the way, sort of related, I read this on the attention schema theory of consciousness. https://grazianolab.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf3411/files/graziano/files/artificial_consc_2017.pdf
[22/02/2023, 22:42:25] Alice Lafferty: Pretty interesting. I'm coming round to eliminative materialism. It goes on to say how consciousness can might be created in a machine. Integrated information theory is also mentioned at the end.
[22/02/2023, 22:43:28] Alice Lafferty: I'm sort of curious to what extent computers make internal models of themselves?
[22/02/2023, 22:44:56] Alice Lafferty: Obviously not obliged to read, but it basically posits that the brain constructs an internal descriptive and predictive model of its own attention, and this model is what we know as 'consciousness'.
[22/02/2023, 22:45:57] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, I've read that one before
[22/02/2023, 22:46:11] Alex Regueiro: It's become much more popular in recent years I gather
[22/02/2023, 22:46:23] Alice Lafferty: I found it interesting because most literature on the hard problem asks how a brain might generate subjective experience, whereas this instead asks why a brain would _make the claim that_ it has a subjective experience.
[22/02/2023, 22:46:27] Alex Regueiro: One of the articles I read goes into the experimentation used to justify the model too
[22/02/2023, 22:46:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh!
[22/02/2023, 22:46:34] Alice Lafferty: What did you think?
[22/02/2023, 22:46:53] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I promise this was related to what we were talking about earlier
[22/02/2023, 22:47:02] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, I meant read *about* that one (that theory). Not the specific article... though I'm going to read that soon!
[22/02/2023, 22:47:08] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, I found it quite convincing overall.
[22/02/2023, 22:47:51] Alex Regueiro: Hah, as I recall IIT was the subject of one of our early convos! üôÇ
[22/02/2023, 22:47:53] Alice Lafferty: Like what?
[22/02/2023, 22:48:21] Alice Lafferty: Yep,you introduced me to that, that's why I mentioned it
[22/02/2023, 22:49:03] Alex Regueiro: I still think eliminative materialism is too strong, but that's really interesting how your view is shifting.
[22/02/2023, 22:49:30] Alex Regueiro: Well, AI doesn't need to generate new stronger AIs to be malevolent in all sorts of ways.
[22/02/2023, 22:49:49] Alice Lafferty: It's less so that I'm compelled _towards_ EM, and more so that I am propelled _away_ from dualism.
[22/02/2023, 22:49:53] Alex Regueiro: Any AI even reasonably close to being "strong", and with access to vast amounts of data, has the potential to do all sorts of nefarious things
[22/02/2023, 22:50:19] Alex Regueiro: I know, I'm being very vague here
[22/02/2023, 22:50:27] Alice Lafferty: By what mechanism would it come to do nefarious things?
[22/02/2023, 22:50:43] Alice Lafferty: Instruction by bad human actors?
[22/02/2023, 22:50:51] Alice Lafferty: Paperclip style misalignment?
[22/02/2023, 22:51:14] Alice Lafferty: Develop its own goals?
[22/02/2023, 22:54:24] Alex Regueiro: Ah, very reasonable then. I mean, it's probably most sensible not to commit fully to an alternative solution yet. I'm not myself either. Although my views loosely fall within the reductionist camp, I'm not sure I can say much more, because so many of the details of one's position depend on the minutiae of definitions, and tedious semantics of language.
[22/02/2023, 22:55:04] Alice Lafferty: I find the fact that they're trained using positive reinforcement so curious... why would a superintelligence complete a task that is harder than hacking its reward function? Sorry if I obviously sound naive here.
[22/02/2023, 22:56:19] Alex Regueiro: My instinct (can't say it's based on anything too concrete) is that it would be unforeseen interpretations and ramifications of the explicitly provided goals (which are often far from explicit and leave a lot of room for interpretation, or internal optimisation and evolution).
[22/02/2023, 22:56:31] Alex Regueiro: More or less along the lines of Asimov's concerns, I think?
[22/02/2023, 22:56:39] Alex Regueiro: Of course, this is eminently possible too
[22/02/2023, 22:56:40] Alice Lafferty: I guess the problem with physical reductionism is that it's basically unfalsifiable because it attempts to co-opt everything into itself.
[22/02/2023, 22:57:28] Alex Regueiro: Although unlikely to lead to a wider threat to the human species. Unless a genuine doomsday cult (not referring to LessWrong here!) were to get access to it.
[22/02/2023, 22:57:48] Alex Regueiro: Sort of a parrallel to nuclear weapons in that particular sense.
[22/02/2023, 22:58:16] Alice Lafferty: Ofc most of these theories are unfalsifiable.
[22/02/2023, 22:58:21] Alex Regueiro: Not sure I quite get you here... elaborate?
[22/02/2023, 22:58:31] Alice Lafferty: Right this sounds to me like the paperclip maximiser
[22/02/2023, 23:00:23] Alice Lafferty: I will try and find the example, but there was a computer which was instructed to simulate a hand grasping a ball. It 'figured out' that it would be rewarded for merely giving the appearance of a hand grasping a ball.
[22/02/2023, 23:01:46] Alice Lafferty: And this was easier than completing the actual task. Essentially the AI was rewarded for proxies of success rather than success itself, so that's what it did - ie. it became deceptive.
[22/02/2023, 23:02:30] Alice Lafferty: I think the cap we've managed to keep on nuclear arms proliferation bodes pretty well actually
[22/02/2023, 23:04:34] Alex Regueiro: Oh right. That example helps, thanks. Why do you find the use of positive reinforcement curious, though? It's a basic goal-oriented strategy.
[22/02/2023, 23:04:45] Alice Lafferty: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Robot_hand_trained_with_human_feedback_%27pretends%27_to_grasp_ball.ogg
[22/02/2023, 23:05:09] Alex Regueiro: True. We just have to avoid the AI equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis actually kicking off!
[22/02/2023, 23:05:34] Alex Regueiro: I mean, long-term the way the nuclear arms race has gone bodes well, but short-medium term, less so.
[22/02/2023, 23:05:48] Alice Lafferty: I'm sure it is, but how do you avoid deceptive behaviour like this?
[22/02/2023, 23:06:21] Alex Regueiro: And I don't think this is intrinsically problematic. It sort of all boils down to unintended consequences of goals you give it, or equivalently reward functions that you provide.
[22/02/2023, 23:06:26] Alice Lafferty: Yes. Also this technology (may?) be more easily reproducible by individuals in a way that nukes aren't
[22/02/2023, 23:06:29] Alex Regueiro: I mean, humans do it all the time
[22/02/2023, 23:06:47] Alex Regueiro: In both harmless and harmful ways
[22/02/2023, 23:07:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes true
[22/02/2023, 23:07:59] Alex Regueiro: You can obviously attach a strong negative reward merely to the act of lying, but that still may not be nearly enough to preclude potentially nasty behaviour. (I'm confident it's not.) Or conversely, some absolute rules may hamstring the AI to the point it's no longer good for anything much.
[22/02/2023, 23:08:05] Alex Regueiro: Well, inversely, not conversely.
[22/02/2023, 23:08:37] Alice Lafferty: Ok, so these all seem like the same genre of problem
[22/02/2023, 23:09:17] Alex Regueiro: Indeed, that's the most salient and worrying dysanalogy, I'd say.
[22/02/2023, 23:09:24] Alex Regueiro: To me at least, yep
[22/02/2023, 23:10:53] Alice Lafferty: The task seems to be having to catch every potential outcome and account for it.
[22/02/2023, 23:10:57] Alice Lafferty: ? Simple!
[22/02/2023, 23:11:24] Alice Lafferty: Have you adjusted your timeframe at all since Bing?
[22/02/2023, 23:11:38] Alex Regueiro: Exactly haha
[22/02/2023, 23:11:51] Alex Regueiro: It's like carrying out the perfect crime.
[22/02/2023, 23:11:56] Alex Regueiro: You'll always miss out something
[22/02/2023, 23:12:45] Alex Regueiro: Honestly, I might just haver to! It's scarily impressive in some ways. Considerably more than ChatGPT-3. It's still guilty of the odd platitude (perhaps even regular ones), but the progress is astonishing...
[22/02/2023, 23:12:46] Alex Regueiro: https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1626084142239649792
[22/02/2023, 23:12:50] Alex Regueiro: Did you see that?
[22/02/2023, 23:12:55] Alice Lafferty: I think after a scary NYT article came out there was a bit of talk about legislating against their development.. but I'm sure it's far too late for that.
[22/02/2023, 23:13:58] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah
[22/02/2023, 23:13:59] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure it is too late, though we really do need to act quickly. Centres at top universities that research and publish on the (existential) risks of AI and other things just aren't remotely enough
[22/02/2023, 23:14:05] Alex Regueiro: Or won't be soon, at least
[22/02/2023, 23:14:52] Alice Lafferty: Probably part of this is that the US cannot afford to stop research because they have to keep up with Chinese military intel
[22/02/2023, 23:15:04] Alice Lafferty: Which apparently increasingly uses AI.
[22/02/2023, 23:15:23] Alice Lafferty: Really is like an arms race
[22/02/2023, 23:15:39] Alex Regueiro: If the AI world blows up before legislation is instituted, however, I wouldn't be surprised to see a "Butlerian Jihad" quickly follow.
[22/02/2023, 23:15:43] Alex Regueiro: Or maybe that's just me being hopeful.
[22/02/2023, 23:16:44] Alex Regueiro: I can imagine I'd be at the forefront of it, even though (strong) AI fascinates me on an intellectual ‚Äì both scientific and philosophical ‚Äì level. I'd love to invent it... and then wipe it from the face of Earth!
[22/02/2023, 23:16:48] Alice Lafferty: Isn't there huge amounts of 'AI safety' research being done?
[22/02/2023, 23:17:22] Alice Lafferty: Haha
[22/02/2023, 23:18:53] Alex Regueiro: Could well be. No doubt they have plenty of spies in the CCP and the big Chinese state-owned companies these days, however. Everyone knows China caught up to the West so quickly in terms of technology and engineering (well, it still has a bit left to go in a few areas) through industrial and state espionage far more than their own ingenuity. The US and other Western nations will have zero compunction about doing the same back to them.
[22/02/2023, 23:18:56] Alice Lafferty: Yeah esp when they all realise they're unemployed. But would the general public even have much influence in that situation? Probably be quite easy to subdue
[22/02/2023, 23:19:41] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure exactly, but it's grown a lot over the past 10-15 years I think? These famous centres like at Oxford and Cambridge, but probably at least one or two researchers in the field at every major university now. I wouldn't be surprised at least.
[22/02/2023, 23:19:43] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes I've heard about this..
[22/02/2023, 23:20:03] Alex Regueiro: What I'm saying though, is there remains a chasm between that and actual legislation and political will.
[22/02/2023, 23:20:43] Alex Regueiro: One lesson from history is never underestimate the power of the proles. Even if the way they "win" is by their sentiment filtering through to the upper echelons of socierty...
[22/02/2023, 23:20:44] Alice Lafferty: I don't think it has entered the tiny minds of anyone currently serving in the British government..
[22/02/2023, 23:21:17] Alice Lafferty: Hm, don't social mores usually flow the other wayü§î
[22/02/2023, 23:21:17] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. Calling our current crop of politicians myopic is somehow far too generous to them still.
[22/02/2023, 23:21:51] Alice Lafferty: So to what exactly? <10 years until 'something' happens?
[22/02/2023, 23:22:00] Alex Regueiro: I don't think so. They often remain detached and stably so for long periods.
[22/02/2023, 23:22:08] Alex Regueiro: Big cultural shifts are usually imposed from the top down
[22/02/2023, 23:22:11] Alex Regueiro: But this is a different thing
[22/02/2023, 23:22:24] Alex Regueiro: The advent of strong AI? I wouldn't bet against it now.
[22/02/2023, 23:22:35] Alex Regueiro: And 20 seems like a fairly liberal estimate.
[22/02/2023, 23:22:47] Alice Lafferty: üòß
[22/02/2023, 23:23:16] Alex Regueiro: Haha sorry. I shouldn't be working you up and reinforcing your doomsdaying, especially at this hour!
[22/02/2023, 23:23:29] Alex Regueiro: If anything you've got me more onto that bandwagon recently.
[22/02/2023, 23:23:40] Alice Lafferty: I thought the bay area guys were just being dramatic..
[22/02/2023, 23:24:05] Alice Lafferty: I guess so
[22/02/2023, 23:24:33] Alice Lafferty: I've contaminated you with Yudowskyism!
[22/02/2023, 23:25:05] Alice Lafferty: I thought you were going to say 'ha, don't be silly another century at least :)'
[22/02/2023, 23:25:19] Alex Regueiro: For example, traditionally the "good Christian" morals have been a feature of the British middle class and upper working class maybe. The aristocracy and the dregs of society were consistently pretty terrible (in similar and divergent ways), and it remained this way for centuries as far as I can tell.
[22/02/2023, 23:25:27] Alex Regueiro: And applies to many other societies/cultures historically too.
[22/02/2023, 23:25:44] Alex Regueiro: haha
[22/02/2023, 23:25:55] Alex Regueiro: What now?
[22/02/2023, 23:26:06] Alex Regueiro: Well this certainly wasn't going to get me to increase my estimate üòâ
[22/02/2023, 23:26:08] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah I think Noel Coward made a comment like this.
[22/02/2023, 23:26:49] Alice Lafferty: 'The working classes can act in a vulgar way, and the upper class can be silly; but the middle class is, or at least considers itself, the moral backbone of society'
[22/02/2023, 23:26:52] Alice Lafferty: But anyway
[22/02/2023, 23:27:06] Alex Regueiro: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die (at the hands of our ChatGPT-5 overlords)
[22/02/2023, 23:27:46] Alex Regueiro: Ah interesting. Not surprised he said something like this though. Does seem quite in line with the little I know about him.
[22/02/2023, 23:28:11] Alex Regueiro: (Last time I was in Cambridge it was to see a Coward play.)
[22/02/2023, 23:28:37] Alice Lafferty: Well, this is one thing that permits me a bit of skepticism - people who apparently believe something catastrophic is happening in the relatively near future... don't seem to hve altered their behaviour at all?
[22/02/2023, 23:29:09] Alice Lafferty: Why aren't they getting in huge debt/building bunkers/losing their minds?
[22/02/2023, 23:29:25] Alex Regueiro: Yes, and also, by induction over history... they're usually drastically wrong!
[22/02/2023, 23:29:48] Alice Lafferty: Oh nice, I've never seen any of his plays. That quote was about the film Brief Encounters, for which he wrote the screenplay.
[22/02/2023, 23:29:57] Alex Regueiro: Want to run away with me and become preppers? üòÄ
[22/02/2023, 23:30:11] Alice Lafferty: Well exactly!
[22/02/2023, 23:31:05] Alice Lafferty: It seems if, as they would put it, your 'epistemic status' is approaching 'very likely' - what is your plan?
[22/02/2023, 23:32:07] Alex Regueiro: I actually think that by nature I'm all too prone to exaggerating threats and doomsdaying, so the sceptical/rational side of me is always hyper-vigilant to counter the tendency.
[22/02/2023, 23:32:25] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe it wouldn't be correct to assign probability to epistemic status but you get what I mean
[22/02/2023, 23:32:41] Alex Regueiro: Depends if you're a hardcore Bayesian, really!
[22/02/2023, 23:32:43] Alex Regueiro: Hmm
[22/02/2023, 23:32:54] Alice Lafferty: Well that is exactly how I am. I know that I'm very very high in neuroticism.
[22/02/2023, 23:33:07] Alice Lafferty: So have to bet against myself a bit
[22/02/2023, 23:33:22] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[22/02/2023, 23:33:48] Alex Regueiro: It seems like you're mainly doing alright though. Staying on guard, and constantly tweaking your threat compass, at least.
[22/02/2023, 23:33:56] Alice Lafferty: I think they use very subjective ones, like 'speculative', 'my best guess', 'authoritative'. Not sure how those are qualified those :S
[22/02/2023, 23:34:03] Alice Lafferty: *though
[22/02/2023, 23:34:34] Alex Regueiro: Growing up, my dad and granddad were rather like that, so I think that actually served well to bias me against such habits!
[22/02/2023, 23:34:46] Alice Lafferty: I guess I'm trying to figure out whether the shock will be mostly economic, ie mass unemployment, or something more existential.
[22/02/2023, 23:34:51] Alex Regueiro: My granddad had a good excuse though, and he was probably the worst.
[22/02/2023, 23:35:23] Alice Lafferty: You mean very prone to catastrophising?
[22/02/2023, 23:37:01] Alex Regueiro: I still think the first and biggest shock to us all will be the collapse of the consensus social order in most developed Western societies, simultaneous with some sort of economic cataclysm. To what precise degree I couldn't predict, but very significant. But after that, AI is right up there in terms of threats
[22/02/2023, 23:37:04] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, catastrophising
[22/02/2023, 23:37:07] Alice Lafferty: Maybe moving to an uninhabited island mean an AI won't have my guts for paperclips :(
[22/02/2023, 23:37:16] Alex Regueiro: Or at least a sensitive threat radar
[22/02/2023, 23:37:33] Alice Lafferty: Cold war must have been immensely stressful for them
[22/02/2023, 23:37:47] Alex Regueiro: Let's just hope nanobots remain science fiction.
[22/02/2023, 23:38:15] Alice Lafferty: And you think this is going to happen, generously, before 2050
[22/02/2023, 23:38:23] Alice Lafferty: Oh jeez
[22/02/2023, 23:38:31] Alice Lafferty: This is another of Yudowsky's pet theories
[22/02/2023, 23:38:34] Alex Regueiro: Yes exactly. My granddad was closely involved, in that he was in WWII, saw it burgeon, and his career was closely connected with it for some time. But at least he saw it end too!
[22/02/2023, 23:39:04] Alex Regueiro: Haha I don't have the emotional capacity for that discussion tonight. But yes, I'm hardly surprised!
[22/02/2023, 23:39:21] Alice Lafferty: Hm have you told me about this before?ü§î What do you mean closely connected - military?
[22/02/2023, 23:39:58] Alex Regueiro: I say there's a minimum 50% chance. Yes, I'm being a Bayesian in a sort of gung-ho way here, but... you get the gist.
[22/02/2023, 23:40:21] Alex Regueiro: Well, indirectly. He worked on the guidance systems for the American ICBMs.
[22/02/2023, 23:40:24] Alex Regueiro: Through contractors
[22/02/2023, 23:40:31] Alex Regueiro: He left the navy shortly after WWII though
[22/02/2023, 23:40:56] Alex Regueiro: And I probably didn't tell you, no
[22/02/2023, 23:41:02] Alice Lafferty: I'm amazed that you are so calm
[22/02/2023, 23:41:13] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[22/02/2023, 23:42:00] Alice Lafferty: Huh that's interesting. I'd be interested to know how the guidance systems worked as early as, would it have been the 50s/60s?
[22/02/2023, 23:42:44] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure I am, though at least I have scraps of Stoic, Buddhist, and Epicurean tradition to rely on. And whatever "wisdom" 32 years on this Earth might have granted me.
[22/02/2023, 23:43:02] Alex Regueiro: From the 50s to 70s, roughly. I'm not sure exactly when.
[22/02/2023, 23:43:23] Alex Regueiro: He was also working on the Apollo missions in the 60s.
[22/02/2023, 23:43:42] Alice Lafferty: And you still want to have children!
[22/02/2023, 23:44:06] Alice Lafferty: I guess there's no action an ordinary person can take.
[22/02/2023, 23:44:12] Alice Lafferty: We should say the prayer for serenity.
[22/02/2023, 23:44:27] Alex Regueiro: Some of the core techniques haven't changed. Inertial guidance uses the same methods (gyroscopes, accelerometers), just much more precise devices.
[22/02/2023, 23:44:48] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Sincerely, though, I do like that.
[22/02/2023, 23:45:23] Alice Lafferty: Me too. It's really really high in my estimation for any piece of culture anywhere
[22/02/2023, 23:45:42] Alex Regueiro: I think a German-American priest wrote it? But there's something very Stoic about it, and it does the job for the secular/agnostic type for me, more or less!
[22/02/2023, 23:46:12] Alex Regueiro: Haha. Well, I'm very open to it in, though by no means super-eager at this point in time.
[22/02/2023, 23:46:42] Alice Lafferty: But this was pre-internet right? So they couldn't control them distantly in real time
[22/02/2023, 23:47:25] Alice Lafferty: I mean if you think there is a >50% chance they will not make it to adulthood
[22/02/2023, 23:47:45] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, I think about it all the time
[22/02/2023, 23:47:59] Alex Regueiro: One of the few such things I have in my notes on my phone, in case I feel it deserves a read at any moment. I should really know it by heart, but...
[22/02/2023, 23:48:41] Alice Lafferty: I actually have a similar question about unmanned rockets in that sense.
[22/02/2023, 23:48:48] Alex Regueiro: I recall even my borderline-religious (irreligious for the time!) grandma really liked it, and my mum has a card somewhere with it written on.
[22/02/2023, 23:49:03] Alex Regueiro: Well I didn't say everyone would die!
[22/02/2023, 23:49:10] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's really good
[22/02/2023, 23:49:15] Alex Regueiro: Just that they could see cataclysmic changes.
[22/02/2023, 23:49:19] Alex Regueiro: In society or technology or both
[22/02/2023, 23:49:35] Alex Regueiro: Well, the former implies the latter pretty much
[22/02/2023, 23:49:40] Alex Regueiro: err, latter implies the former
[22/02/2023, 23:49:55] Alice Lafferty: Not a very high probability they will be positive changes either. That is even worse than dying in a way.
[22/02/2023, 23:50:49] Alex Regueiro: Oh no, I mean they are almost sure to be negative. But nevertheless probably well short of armageddon.
[22/02/2023, 23:51:58] Alice Lafferty: Some kind of de-modernisation scenario?
‚Äé[22/02/2023, 23:52:19] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[22/02/2023, 23:52:34] Alex Regueiro: I suppose I think of it as a deluge or renewal (I'm aware how Christian-cultish that sounds) that seems to be mandated every so often by the large-scale dynamics of human history. But it's just looking at the world around us, doing a and doing a bit of induction/extrapolation, as admittedly error prone as it is.
[22/02/2023, 23:52:59] Alex Regueiro: If we can avoid total destruction though (I have faith in that), I think we'll come out of it all better for it in the medium term.
[22/02/2023, 23:53:08] Alex Regueiro: I would say the same about e.g. the collapse of the Roman Empire.
[22/02/2023, 23:53:34] Alex Regueiro: Or even the Industrial Revolution (which had some horrific short-term consequences).
[22/02/2023, 23:54:09] Alex Regueiro: Possibly. That's so hard to predict. May just be a political fracturing and reorganisation of the world, along with a socioeconomic one of course.
[22/02/2023, 23:54:13] Alice Lafferty: Oh when you put it like that it's not so bad. Recovery in western Europe was very rapid, historically speaking.
[22/02/2023, 23:54:33] Alex Regueiro: Hah. Straight out of the XR handbook eh?
[22/02/2023, 23:54:59] Alice Lafferty: No actually, Club of Rome, ie. The Limits To Growth malthusian guys
[22/02/2023, 23:55:06] Alex Regueiro: Depends what sort of recovery you're talking about. Population? Social organisation? Technological sophistication?
[22/02/2023, 23:55:19] Alex Regueiro: I know, I was purely kidding üòâ
[22/02/2023, 23:55:33] Alex Regueiro: Club of Rome is apt though... first I've heard of it.
[22/02/2023, 23:55:48] Alice Lafferty: So you think the AI that causes this collapse will itself be destroyed in the process?
[22/02/2023, 23:56:14] Alice Lafferty: Won't the kind of AI strog enough to cause mass upheaval have exceptional survival mechanisms?
[22/02/2023, 23:56:38] Alice Lafferty: Let's say something very vague like 'complexity'. So social organisation, yeah.
[22/02/2023, 23:56:54] Alice Lafferty: Medicine, literacy, those good things
[22/02/2023, 23:56:58] Alex Regueiro: Oh, sorry. I think we got threads crossed somewhere here. We've been switching back and forth between discussing AI-induced calamity and other sorts (like purely socioeconomic). At least I have.
[22/02/2023, 23:57:16] Alice Lafferty: Sorry! I've been missing a lot of the jokes today
[22/02/2023, 23:57:27] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure literacy recovered to the Roman level until the Renaissance, but most other things within 500-600 years.
[22/02/2023, 23:57:37] Alex Regueiro: Still a bloody long time on the scale of human life.
[22/02/2023, 23:57:44] Alice Lafferty: Oh right. No, I was still under the impression this was the AI singularity.
[22/02/2023, 23:58:00] Alice Lafferty: What else do you think is going to cause a collapse? Climate crisis?
[22/02/2023, 23:58:42] Alex Regueiro: Technology certainly by the High Middle Ages. Of course, what helped hugely is that a) the Eastern Roman Empire survived, b) the Arab world inherited a lot, and developed it, passing the baton back in due course, c) the Franks and other ex-barbarian tribes preserved some of the good elements of Roman civilisation, although certainly not all.
[22/02/2023, 23:58:52] Alice Lafferty: Yeah but fast considering we have existed for 200,000 years
[22/02/2023, 23:59:16] Alex Regueiro: That's the other one but honestly I think socioeconomic disintegration and AI are both a little more ominous.
[22/02/2023, 23:59:39] Alice Lafferty: Could you elaborate on what you mean by 'socioeconomic disintegration'?
[23/02/2023, 00:00:47] Alex Regueiro: My fault. I've been talking about that but also other things. Anyway, an AI singularity where the AI developed a purely selfish goal (through whatever means), i.e. one that entirely discounted humans, would probably mean the complete annihilation of us, but I consider that extremely unlikely in the grand scheme of things.
[23/02/2023, 00:01:46] Alice Lafferty: Oh I didn't realise the meaning was that specific. I thought it was just any widely disruptive artficial intelligence.
[23/02/2023, 00:01:54] Alex Regueiro: Just sort of a Spengler-esque exhaustion of our current modes (social, economic, political) within the Western world.
[23/02/2023, 00:02:40] Alex Regueiro: Mainly on the basis that the logical conclusion of the libertarian-liberal cycle doesn't look good at all. Increasingly unstable.
[23/02/2023, 00:03:16] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I can see the West going into a broad decline as our populations age. But I don't see it as being global I guess.
[23/02/2023, 00:03:55] Alice Lafferty: The 'logical conclusion' being ?
[23/02/2023, 00:04:33] Alex Regueiro: I've interpreted it to mean the point at which AIs can purely by themselves generate more "intelligent" AIs, and so on, constrained only by some natural limit... the singularity then being the point at which this exponential proliferation of the number and capability of AIs begins, and everything becomes impossible to predict.
[23/02/2023, 00:05:14] Alex Regueiro: A free-for-all society with nothing but a pseudo-culture. Something resembling a Hobbesian state of nature, even. Maybe anarcho-tyranny.
[23/02/2023, 00:05:33] Alex Regueiro: I'm not saying we're guaranteed this, but this is sort of my worst fear. And seems at least moderately plausible!
[23/02/2023, 00:05:42] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok, I will adopt that definition..
[23/02/2023, 00:05:48] Alex Regueiro: Agreed on this. But it may affect the entirety of the West.
[23/02/2023, 00:06:26] Alex Regueiro: So, we could still get strong AI without an AI singularity. That's quite viable
[23/02/2023, 00:06:27] Alice Lafferty: Huh! I've heard you claim equally that we live under a heavily censorious nanny state!
[23/02/2023, 00:06:54] Alex Regueiro: Are you sure that wasn't someone else in the chat hah?
[23/02/2023, 00:06:55] Alice Lafferty: This is what I do not understand about social conservatism more generally though
[23/02/2023, 00:07:22] Alice Lafferty: Like society is both too repressive and too permissive at the same time
[23/02/2023, 00:07:26] Alex Regueiro: I mean, we do in some ways, but only a strict subset.
[23/02/2023, 00:07:50] Alex Regueiro: Right. This is the essential characterisation of anarcho-tyrany really.
[23/02/2023, 00:07:53] Alex Regueiro: tyranny*
[23/02/2023, 00:08:38] Alex Regueiro: My hope (actually my usual not-so-pessimistic self) is that we'll have some radical shift before we reach that point. Or as we start to enter it.
[23/02/2023, 00:08:43] Alice Lafferty: I'm not really familiar with the term, it sounds obviously oxymoronic though?
[23/02/2023, 00:09:12] Alice Lafferty: You've definitely taken issue with 'wokeism', cancel culture etc I think
[23/02/2023, 00:09:21] Alex Regueiro: Oh. You should read up on it a little! I only first heard of it a year or two ago. It's quite intentionally oxymoronic, but it makes perfect sense once you unpack the concept.
[23/02/2023, 00:09:30] Alex Regueiro: Oh, well that's for sure
[23/02/2023, 00:09:45] Alex Regueiro: But don't we all, in the salon? You included? üòâ
[23/02/2023, 00:09:57] Alex Regueiro: (Whatever we prefer to call it)
[23/02/2023, 00:10:09] Alice Lafferty: 'A state that fails to enforce or adjudicate protection to its citizens while simultaneously persecuting innocent conduct.' - is this what you mean?
[23/02/2023, 00:10:27] Alex Regueiro: It's not the best definition
[23/02/2023, 00:10:34] Alex Regueiro: But not entirely wrong
[23/02/2023, 00:10:40] Alex Regueiro: Let me find one
[23/02/2023, 00:11:16] Alex Regueiro: "law without order: a constant busybodying about behavior that does not at all derive from a shared moral consensus"
[23/02/2023, 00:11:20] Alice Lafferty: At first look this doesn't seem to describe the UK for example. The state is actually highly effective at protecting its citizens and enforcing law.
[23/02/2023, 00:11:35] Alex Regueiro: "Anarcho-tyranny is a concept, where the state is argued to be more interested in controlling citizens so that they do not oppose the managerial class (tyranny) rather than controlling real criminals (causing anarchy)."
[23/02/2023, 00:11:39] Alice Lafferty: Ok. Where does the 'anarcho' bit come in?
[23/02/2023, 00:11:53] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[23/02/2023, 00:11:59] Alex Regueiro: When Urban Dictionary has a better definition than Wikipedia. üôÉ
[23/02/2023, 00:12:09] Alice Lafferty: Ha!
[23/02/2023, 00:12:22] Alice Lafferty: Well, I think this is still true
[23/02/2023, 00:12:36] Alice Lafferty: We don't 'fail to control criminals'.
[23/02/2023, 00:12:57] Alex Regueiro: On a global scale, that's largely true. But even compared to the UK of 30 or 40 years ago, or some other Western nations, it's sadly not.
[23/02/2023, 00:13:38] Alex Regueiro: If you've looked at the crime statistics (of all sorts) over recent years and decades, they don't paint a good trend, to say the least.
[23/02/2023, 00:13:39] Alice Lafferty: The 'defund the police' stuff is a bit louder in the US for sure, but even there it's not actually widely implimented.
[23/02/2023, 00:14:23] Alex Regueiro: I'm not saying this is all around the corner. But by 2040 or 2050? It's at least plausible.
[23/02/2023, 00:14:34] Alice Lafferty: Just looked briefly, all the stats goüìâüìâ
[23/02/2023, 00:14:38] Alex Regueiro: Based on extrapolation from current trends though, which is always dangerous.
[23/02/2023, 00:15:24] Alex Regueiro: Lot of classes of reported crime have skyrocketed, and conviction rates have concurrently fallen in many cases.
[23/02/2023, 00:16:07] Alex Regueiro: This is a rare occasion though, and I'm amused! I mean, you being the optimist and me the pessimist. üòâ
[23/02/2023, 00:18:02] Alice Lafferty: Sorry just trying to get some grip on crime stats.
[23/02/2023, 00:18:34] Alex Regueiro: no worries
[23/02/2023, 00:18:39] Alice Lafferty: Obviously a discrepancy between self-reported and those recorded by the police.
[23/02/2023, 00:19:00] Alice Lafferty: But along both of those measures crime has fallen since the 1990s.
[23/02/2023, 00:20:37] Alice Lafferty: Hm well I do take issue with implying the UK is 'anarchic' in any sense. We have some of the lowest violent crime in the world, it seems a little unfair.
[23/02/2023, 00:20:51] Alice Lafferty: Like very much a first world problem.
[23/02/2023, 00:21:08] Alex Regueiro: I wasn't in the slightest implying this.
[23/02/2023, 00:21:47] Alex Regueiro: I think the way the conversation turned gave you the wrong idea. I just gave anarcho-tyranny as a commonly-cited example of what social disintegration in the West in a few decades might look like.
[23/02/2023, 00:21:49] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, this is just what you predict?
[23/02/2023, 00:22:10] Alice Lafferty: I see, I see
[23/02/2023, 00:23:12] Alice Lafferty: It seems unlikely if anything because our population will skew so old.
[23/02/2023, 00:23:35] Alex Regueiro: More likely to me personally is the evaporation of culture and the undoing of the glue that holds society together in terms of the sort of character traits and human interactions we promote, demonise, or remain neutral on. All the sort of stuff Lasch writes about.
[23/02/2023, 00:23:38] Alice Lafferty: Men 15-30 commit almost all violent crime. We won't have any of them!
[23/02/2023, 00:23:55] Alex Regueiro: This is a very materialist concern, and not invalid. But I can't bring myself to see it as the most pressing one.
[23/02/2023, 00:24:19] Alex Regueiro: The usual concerns of the cultural conservative, to a large extent
[23/02/2023, 00:24:23] Alice Lafferty: I mean, it will have lots of implications for the general violence levels
[23/02/2023, 00:24:38] Alice Lafferty: Eh, I think I've said this before but this is like an age old concern
[23/02/2023, 00:24:39] Alex Regueiro: In Britain it's not rising that fast, however
[23/02/2023, 00:25:14] Alex Regueiro: Countries like Japan and Italy will give us an idea of how to grapple with that issue well or not so well!
[23/02/2023, 00:25:32] Alex Regueiro: I also think it's symptomatic of underlying social decay, however.
[23/02/2023, 00:25:51] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah they're like ~20 years ahead of us in terms of demographic crash I think
[23/02/2023, 00:25:52] Alex Regueiro: The difference is, however, no society in the past has been remotely as liberal as our current ones.
[23/02/2023, 00:25:57] Alex Regueiro: Right
[23/02/2023, 00:26:07] Alex Regueiro: current Western ones, that is
[23/02/2023, 00:26:08] Alice Lafferty: Yes, but you could say that at all points of history!
[23/02/2023, 00:26:13] Alex Regueiro: Not true
[23/02/2023, 00:26:24] Alex Regueiro: The shift in the last century or so has been far more drastic
[23/02/2023, 00:26:49] Alice Lafferty: Society was more 'liberal' in the 20th century than the 19th century than the 14th century and so on...0"
[23/02/2023, 00:27:02] Alex Regueiro: It's completely incorrect whig history to assume human culture/society has been monotonically liberalising since pre-history.
[23/02/2023, 00:27:03] Alice Lafferty: Yes the rate of change is faster but still
[23/02/2023, 00:27:12] Alex Regueiro: Examination of the facts suggests anything but that
[23/02/2023, 00:27:34] Alex Regueiro: On shorter time scales it's true, I'll grant
[23/02/2023, 00:27:39] Alice Lafferty: Well there have been fluctuations but that is the broad trend. The whig part comes in when you suggest it would or should continue indefinitely.
[23/02/2023, 00:27:47] Alice Lafferty: Which I don't
[23/02/2023, 00:28:18] Alex Regueiro: But there's always a reset. Lots of mini resets (dictatorships, certain wars), and the occasional big reset (fall of the Roman Empire, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, etc.)
[23/02/2023, 00:28:42] Alice Lafferty: Yes the fall of Rome was the big 'fluctuation' I was thinking of.
[23/02/2023, 00:29:00] Alice Lafferty: But Renaissance humanism->enlightenment have been clear linearly liberalising forces
[23/02/2023, 00:29:13] Alex Regueiro: It's also how you look at history and see it inexorable progress towards one end.
[23/02/2023, 00:30:03] Alice Lafferty: I don't see any progress towards any end. It's just true that compared to the first human civilisations, societies have increasingly liberalised?
[23/02/2023, 00:30:15] Alice Lafferty: Not straightforwardly at all - often very bumpily with setbacks
[23/02/2023, 00:30:35] Alice Lafferty: But it's still an overwhelming trend _so far_. Could reverse ofc, as you're suggesting.
[23/02/2023, 00:30:55] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure renaissance humanism led to huge wide-scale liberalisation, but yes, probably the general trend since the High Middle Ages has been one of liberalisation of social laws. But that's still only max 1000 years out of.... 200,000 years as you say (though truly modern humans have existed for less than 100,000 to be fair)
[23/02/2023, 00:31:35] Alex Regueiro: And to assume just because it's done us well up to now ‚Äì or rather, up to roughly the early 20th century ‚Äì that it can't go too far (and much too far)... is a grave logical fallacy.
[23/02/2023, 00:32:05] Alice Lafferty: Yes that's exactly what I'm saying. As far as we know prehistoric 'culture' was more or less static until big technological innovations gave everyone a big kick up the ----
[23/02/2023, 00:32:20] Alice Lafferty: I never said anything like this though
[23/02/2023, 00:32:45] Alice Lafferty: I'm a historical materialist at bottom :)
[23/02/2023, 00:32:59] Alice Lafferty: And I agree with you
[23/02/2023, 00:33:37] Alex Regueiro: Yet we can't say there was any real liberalising trend between the "primordial age" (what we know of it) to the High Middle Ages, can't we? Lots of ups and down but throughout recorded history, pretty constant at a more coarse-grained level. And there's a good case to be made that most historical-era societies were far less liberal than hunter-gatherer tribes.
[23/02/2023, 00:33:42] Alice Lafferty: I'm also not particularly associating liberalism with 'improvement' even if my language has suggested that.. (although I do think in many cases it has been better).
[23/02/2023, 00:34:30] Alex Regueiro: Oh I know. Sorry if I implied it. I'm just gainsaying the argument itself (which lots of people seem to make, at least implicitly, just not you).
[23/02/2023, 00:34:59] Alice Lafferty: I don't think so. Most hunter gatherer tribes (as far as I know - and I think we do only know of S American and African ones) had incredibly strict taboo systems & ritualistic culture, that is to say, were highly conformist.
[23/02/2023, 00:35:02] Alex Regueiro: Technology isn't always a liberalising force though. The agricultural revolution apparently forced us to institute all sorts of societal rules that didn't exist (or need to exist) before.
[23/02/2023, 00:35:52] Alex Regueiro: If you take sexual behaviour, for one, it seems to have been far more liberal than e.g. 11th C Western Christendom.
[23/02/2023, 00:35:56] Alice Lafferty: Do you mean private property?
[23/02/2023, 00:35:58] Alex Regueiro: Likewise freedom of movement
[23/02/2023, 00:36:12] Alex Regueiro: Likewise timekeeping
[23/02/2023, 00:36:26] Alice Lafferty: Really? Are you talking about a specific hunter gatherer society?
[23/02/2023, 00:36:32] Alex Regueiro: More complex and advanced societies actually *demand* more rules and norms in order to remain stable.
[23/02/2023, 00:36:53] Alice Lafferty: Hm yes, this seems true I suppose.
[23/02/2023, 00:37:07] Alice Lafferty: Now that I think of it
[23/02/2023, 00:37:16] Alex Regueiro: Nope, fairly generically... as far as can be done üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 00:37:41] Alex Regueiro: Yes, in part. Also the institution of marriage, for example.
[23/02/2023, 00:37:59] Alice Lafferty: I highly doubt they were more sexually permissive. Probably about the same or more.
[23/02/2023, 00:38:20] Alex Regueiro: This is where I have to totally disagree, based on what I've read.
[23/02/2023, 00:38:21] Alice Lafferty: I think that mate guarding was incredibly violent
[23/02/2023, 00:38:38] Alice Lafferty: And enforced with exile or murder
[23/02/2023, 00:38:40] Alex Regueiro: Serial monogamy was widely practised in human prehistory, according to anthropologists.
[23/02/2023, 00:39:19] Alice Lafferty: That doesn't mean the punishments for defecting were less strict.
[23/02/2023, 00:39:24] Alex Regueiro: Well we know that was true well into the Middle Ages and even after, in many places. I don't think we know that was true in all hunter-gatherer societies, although it's plausible enough.
[23/02/2023, 00:39:38] Alex Regueiro: No, but it was still a more liberal situation!
[23/02/2023, 00:39:48] Alex Regueiro: Whatever you say about the punishments for unfaithfulness
[23/02/2023, 00:41:15] Alice Lafferty: Not really in W Europe, I think murder to deter sexual misbehaviour is highly correlated with pastoral cultures(?)
[23/02/2023, 00:41:31] Alex Regueiro: BTW, I meant to say earlier... the tricky thing with anarcho-tyranny is that falling crime rates are actually used to *support* it. I'm not saying this is actually the case, but I'm sure you can see the rationale here.
[23/02/2023, 00:41:44] Alice Lafferty: When I say 'liberal' I just mean, has a greater tolerance for non-conformity.
[23/02/2023, 00:42:11] Alex Regueiro: It was perfectly permissible in many medieval European societies for a man to murder his wife if he caught her cheating.
[23/02/2023, 00:42:20] Alex Regueiro: I mean, especially if was in the fact.
[23/02/2023, 00:42:29] Alex Regueiro: and her lover too, for that matter!
[23/02/2023, 00:42:44] Alice Lafferty: Yes but self-reported crime is also falling
[23/02/2023, 00:42:56] Alice Lafferty: Is this the case?
[23/02/2023, 00:43:13] Alex Regueiro: Not true in many cases, from what I've read.
[23/02/2023, 00:44:12] Alex Regueiro: That's what I've read on several occasions. I looked into it once and seems to check out. Not that it would necessarily happen. And of course people would take all sorts of precautions not to get caught... but the documentary evidence on this is naturally very scanty. We have to go by what the law said, when we don't know common practice.
[23/02/2023, 00:44:21] Alex Regueiro: (And the law permitted it in many cases.)
[23/02/2023, 00:44:59] Alex Regueiro: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/recorded-in-england-and-wales-at-20-year-high-as-charge-rate-hits-new-low
[23/02/2023, 00:45:01] Alex Regueiro: Just one example
[23/02/2023, 00:45:19] Alice Lafferty: https://www.medievalists.net/2012/08/adultery-in-late-medieval-northern-france/

'Adultery was a lesser evil than the murder of a spouse therefore adulterous wives could not be killed.  If a man murdered his wife, the husband was banished or lost his wife‚Äôs property and the ability to remarry or would require dispensation to remarry.' 

Literally just randomly found this. Idk what the sources are though.
[23/02/2023, 00:45:24] Alex Regueiro: The accuracy of reporting (both self-reporting and officially logged incidences) is of course a major obstacle to analysis though.
[23/02/2023, 00:46:38] Alice Lafferty: This seems really unlikely to me, because it would cause so many issues with the wife's family.
[23/02/2023, 00:47:03] Alex Regueiro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultery_in_English_law
[23/02/2023, 00:47:07] Alex Regueiro: There you go
[23/02/2023, 00:47:31] Alex Regueiro: First sentence of "Late Medieval England"
[23/02/2023, 00:48:16] Alex Regueiro: As you'll see, the man had quite a few powers in Anglo-Saxon England too, even though wegeld was intended to reduce the prevalence of this sort of revenge (and more so, family feuds).
[23/02/2023, 00:48:36] Alice Lafferty: This says he had the right to kill the other man, not the wife.
[23/02/2023, 00:49:03] Alice Lafferty: Ofc I wouldn't be surprised if in some cases it was both in the heat of the moment. But yeah
[23/02/2023, 00:50:36] Alice Lafferty: Yeah all of these measures were basically meant to diffuse vendettas right
[23/02/2023, 00:51:11] Alex Regueiro: Fair point. The permissibility of killing an adulterous wife may have been in another context.
[23/02/2023, 00:52:19] Alex Regueiro: (Roman, perhaps?)
[23/02/2023, 00:52:23] Alex Regueiro: I don't recall though
[23/02/2023, 00:52:34] Alex Regueiro: But still, with respect to the widespread permissibility of killing the man caught cheating with her, at certain times and places during the Middle Ages, that supports my point all the same.
[23/02/2023, 00:52:40] Alex Regueiro: Right
[23/02/2023, 00:52:54] Alex Regueiro: Because the Anglo-Saxons in particular had a habit of multi-generational family feuds.
‚Äé[23/02/2023, 00:53:01] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/02/2023, 00:53:03] Alex Regueiro: Which would just decimate some families
[23/02/2023, 00:53:49] Alice Lafferty: I can't see why we'd expect people to underreport when surveyed I guess
[23/02/2023, 00:54:20] Alice Lafferty: Well, I think the same norms applied in hunter gatherer societies though.
[23/02/2023, 00:54:26] Alex Regueiro: To play the devil's advocate... Apathy? Felling of helplessness?
[23/02/2023, 00:55:07] Alex Regueiro: It's possible, though in truth we just don't have hard evidence, and I think at best we could say this rule stayed more or less constant throughout most of human history.
[23/02/2023, 00:55:32] Alice Lafferty: Well, you can impute anything into statistics! I'll say that crime is actually zero and people overreport because they're paranoidüòâ
[23/02/2023, 00:55:45] Alex Regueiro: The one thing that *does* fly in the face of ever-increasing liberalisation was the increased prevalence of lifelong monogamy, however.
[23/02/2023, 00:56:12] Alice Lafferty: For one thing, hunter gatherer societies were much more violent than any agricultural ones.
[23/02/2023, 00:56:14] Alex Regueiro: Hah right. These are fraught statistics. You can put whatever slant on them you want, depending on the ideology you're coming from.
[23/02/2023, 00:56:29] Alex Regueiro: Right, so in that sense they were more liberal too üòâ
[23/02/2023, 00:56:52] Alice Lafferty: ? No it means norms were enforced much more harshly
[23/02/2023, 00:57:25] Alice Lafferty: Why is lifelong monogamy particularly less liberal?
[23/02/2023, 00:57:28] Alex Regueiro: Or we can just call it lawlessness, and say people had freedom to exert their own retribution at a personal level?
[23/02/2023, 00:57:41] Alex Regueiro: Come on...
[23/02/2023, 00:57:43] Alice Lafferty: More like at a group level
[23/02/2023, 00:57:55] Alex Regueiro: Again, this is just guesswork.
[23/02/2023, 00:58:14] Alex Regueiro: All we really know is the absolute levels of violence.
[23/02/2023, 00:58:27] Alice Lafferty: What! The contents of the laws are not particularly important, it's the strictness with which they're enforced that makes the liberalism
[23/02/2023, 00:58:42] Alex Regueiro: Again, I disagree
[23/02/2023, 00:59:00] Alex Regueiro: More laws is necessarily less liberalism.
[23/02/2023, 00:59:13] Alex Regueiro: Less freedom, to use good old Anglo-Saxon words.
[23/02/2023, 01:00:13] Alex Regueiro: Oh, how I wish we could have this conversation after you read Lasch. üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 01:00:22] Alex Regueiro: He destroys so many issues with pure liberalism.
[23/02/2023, 01:00:23] Alice Lafferty: Yes, we have more laws, but those are overwhelmingly to prevent others from molesting you, if you see what I mean. Even libertarians have the non-aggression principal.
[23/02/2023, 01:00:32] Alex Regueiro: I mean, he destroys pure liberalism, he reveals all the issues.
[23/02/2023, 01:01:00] Alex Regueiro: It's a pathetically insufficient principle. The naivety of John Stuart Mill in a nutshell.
[23/02/2023, 01:01:14] Alice Lafferty: It' just 'don't tread on me' basically.
[23/02/2023, 01:01:15] Alex Regueiro: There can be no society, no culture, no binding force with only that principle.
[23/02/2023, 01:01:21] Alex Regueiro: Right
[23/02/2023, 01:01:34] Alice Lafferty: And your right to not be trod on is enshrined in yes, many laws. But it's not less 'liberal' for it.
[23/02/2023, 01:01:44] Alex Regueiro: But virtually every human action has an externality of some sort.
[23/02/2023, 01:01:50] Alice Lafferty: Eh maybe not
[23/02/2023, 01:02:00] Alice Lafferty: Well this is the problem.
[23/02/2023, 01:02:17] Alex Regueiro: Many ones we don't call "harmful" have substantial negative externalities, at least when followed by a quorum of individuals.
[23/02/2023, 01:02:21] Alice Lafferty: This is why I love contracts!
[23/02/2023, 01:02:41] Alex Regueiro: It's funny, I've gone from being a libertarian to detesting libertarianism, over time!
[23/02/2023, 01:02:52] Alex Regueiro: Yes, contracts are wonderful.
[23/02/2023, 01:03:09] Alice Lafferty: It means you can explicitly consent to any given interaction.
[23/02/2023, 01:03:17] Alex Regueiro: Whether it's the "social contract", financial ones, or marriage, they are the mark of civilisation.
[23/02/2023, 01:03:42] Alice Lafferty: The 'social contract' is not a proper contract
[23/02/2023, 01:03:47] Alex Regueiro: The problem is, unless you choose to live outside of society (that's rare), you are implicitly part of the social contract.
[23/02/2023, 01:03:50] Alex Regueiro: But it is
[23/02/2023, 01:04:04] Alice Lafferty: Because it's too ill-defined for anyone to consent to
[23/02/2023, 01:04:27] Alice Lafferty: It's more like a social norm
[23/02/2023, 01:05:02] Alex Regueiro: The laws of this country say otherwise...
[23/02/2023, 01:05:21] Alex Regueiro: Social norms represent the informal end of the social contract.
[23/02/2023, 01:05:28] Alice Lafferty: I really like libertarianism. The only issue I have with it is that it is not conducive to building the sorts of institutions (universities, scientific communities etc) which I think provide huge value.
[23/02/2023, 01:05:28] Alex Regueiro: And the legal code the formal end.
[23/02/2023, 01:05:54] Alice Lafferty: Yes the legal code is very well defined.
[23/02/2023, 01:06:08] Alice Lafferty: Yes so too fuzzy in that way
[23/02/2023, 01:06:09] Alex Regueiro: It's okay, I did too at your age... Maybe with time, you'll see the problem is that it's far too permissible for a human society to function well!
[23/02/2023, 01:06:16] Alex Regueiro: That was my realisation eventually
[23/02/2023, 01:06:38] Alex Regueiro: Libertarianism only allows for a collection of individuals
[23/02/2023, 01:06:40] Alex Regueiro: Not a society
[23/02/2023, 01:06:44] Alice Lafferty: I don't see the problem as being that general
[23/02/2023, 01:06:50] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[23/02/2023, 01:07:09] Alice Lafferty: Don't make it sound too nice!
[23/02/2023, 01:07:13] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[23/02/2023, 01:07:18] Alex Regueiro: It sounds horrific to me.
[23/02/2023, 01:07:37] Alex Regueiro: Without shared assumptions, norms, rules, good luck with life!
[23/02/2023, 01:07:58] Alex Regueiro: If humans were entirely self-sufficient creatures, libertarianism would be a wonderful system.
[23/02/2023, 01:08:03] Alice Lafferty: It's fine, I will just rediscover everything from first principles
[23/02/2023, 01:08:04] Alex Regueiro: But alas, we're not, and can never be.
[23/02/2023, 01:09:05] Alex Regueiro: Reminds me of what that famous biologist (expert on ants) said of Marxism/communism... I think I told you this actually. But it kind of applies to libertarianism too.
[23/02/2023, 01:09:08] Alice Lafferty: Those are imparted on small scale via families I guess, and I could do without them in adulthood. What I'd miss specifically is like a centralised bank of knowledge/ collaborative projects.
[23/02/2023, 01:10:37] Alice Lafferty: 'Socialism works - but only in ants' or something?
[23/02/2023, 01:10:51] Alice Lafferty: But yeah I'm not really a socialist.
[23/02/2023, 01:11:21] Alice Lafferty: Was this E. O. Wilson?
[23/02/2023, 01:11:21] Alex Regueiro: This is really hard to explain properly online. But I shall just invite you to reflect on what the world would be like if people did not share principles and norms beyond "not harming each other" (if that can even be defined adequately, which I don't think it can be). How would we know whom to trust or rely on? More economically, how would the modes of production come about? How would we seek redress for when people do wrongs to us? Why would we help anyone else?
[23/02/2023, 01:11:54] Alex Regueiro: Yes. Usually phrased as "Great idea, wrong species" (re Marxism)
[23/02/2023, 01:12:02] Alice Lafferty: The NAP also prohibits fraud. So I should be able to enter into any economic interaction with a good deal of trust.
[23/02/2023, 01:12:19] Alex Regueiro: Right, but I just think this quip applies really well to libertarianism too.
[23/02/2023, 01:12:37] Alex Regueiro: The logical conclusion of libertarianism is anarchism. You're internally inconsistent until you become an anarchist.
[23/02/2023, 01:12:49] Alice Lafferty: We would seek redress in the same way we do now - go to the police!
[23/02/2023, 01:13:09] Alex Regueiro: And why should the police help you? Why should they even exist in a libertarian society?
[23/02/2023, 01:13:11] Alice Lafferty: Hm, but libertarianism preserves the right to private property.
[23/02/2023, 01:13:37] Alice Lafferty: I'm not allergic to anarchism either to be honest, but I've hardly read anything on it!
[23/02/2023, 01:13:52] Alex Regueiro: It should also point out that empirically no truly libertarian society has ever existed. The closest we come to one is right here and now in the West, and even there we're a good way off true libertarianism.
[23/02/2023, 01:14:29] Alex Regueiro: So with such a complex beast as society (or merely networks of humans, if you prefer), relying entirely on reason is super dangerous.
[23/02/2023, 01:14:44] Alice Lafferty: It's odd that anarchists are associated with the left... maybe anarchist would be very horizontal with restrictions on resource hoarding?
[23/02/2023, 01:15:10] Alex Regueiro: As soon as you introduce the idea of private property, you're belying the core principle of liberalism.
[23/02/2023, 01:15:16] Alice Lafferty: Yes it hasn't been empirically tested.
[23/02/2023, 01:15:28] Alice Lafferty: I think the difference is in the way that people view liberty though...
[23/02/2023, 01:15:32] Alex Regueiro: Which is why I think anarchists are just libertarians who are more honest with themselves.
[23/02/2023, 01:15:43] Alex Regueiro: So was libertarianism, originally
[23/02/2023, 01:15:57] Alice Lafferty: Most people seem to see it as an instrumental value, put towards something else, but what if liberty is just your terminal value?
[23/02/2023, 01:16:18] Alex Regueiro: You see, even if you, in trying to defend libertarianism, are making so many caveats, that you're essentially introducing a whole set of social norms ‚Äì a social contract, you could say. üòâ
[23/02/2023, 01:16:47] Alex Regueiro: Sounds very Aristotelian hah.
[23/02/2023, 01:17:04] Alice Lafferty: Which social norms have I introduced?
[23/02/2023, 01:17:44] Alex Regueiro: This is very true. It's so woolly that it really needs to be pinned down by anyone calling themselves a libertarian, or even liberal. And as a conservative liberal, I'm not even sure I can do that adequately. Well, not that I've properly tried.
[23/02/2023, 01:18:23] Alice Lafferty: I don't particularly self ID as libertarian, but I am defending it here, mainly because I think I'm becoming disillusioned with the reactionary social conservatism I've been embedded in over the last few years.
[23/02/2023, 01:18:28] Alex Regueiro: Private property, the police...
[23/02/2023, 01:18:32] Alice Lafferty: I still self ID as a classic liberal.
[23/02/2023, 01:19:10] Alice Lafferty: These all come part and parcel of a libertarian state - they're not 'social norms', because they're not socially.
[23/02/2023, 01:19:14] Alice Lafferty: They're enforced legally.
[23/02/2023, 01:19:40] Alex Regueiro: Fair enough. Though again, I think Lasch and a few other things do an excellent job of explaining how the seeds of contemporary libertarianism, cultural decay, excessive permissiveness, were sown in the Enlightenment. Easily said with hindsight, mind you.
[23/02/2023, 01:19:53] Alex Regueiro: Ironically some of the best thinkers here are Marxists or ex-Marxists.
[23/02/2023, 01:20:03] Alice Lafferty: What is a 'conservative liberal'? Ultimately you subordinate individual liberty to the good of the whole state?
[23/02/2023, 01:20:09] Alex Regueiro: Bauman also has a lot to say about libertarianism. I really need to read him.
[23/02/2023, 01:20:41] Alex Regueiro: And what is law but a social contract? Law is the removal of freedom for common good.
[23/02/2023, 01:22:00] Alice Lafferty: Yes, that's why I'm more so a classic liberal.. laws that prevent others from interfering with me actually protect my individual liberty.
[23/02/2023, 01:22:32] Alice Lafferty: I agree that I'm in a social contract with others - of mutual non-interference.
[23/02/2023, 01:22:53] Alice Lafferty: So yes if you'd like to see it that way.
[23/02/2023, 01:23:05] Alice Lafferty: Haven't heard of this guy?
[23/02/2023, 01:23:35] Alex Regueiro: Very loosely, I would say it's a state of affairs where the maximum individual liberty is granted whilst allowing for the existence of a stable society that itself enables such individual liberty. There's a reciprocal relationship here, a sort of equilibrium. Equally, the mindset is one of acknowledging the extreme complexity and fragility of human civilisation. and taking a sceptical attitude towards radical progress, whilst not opposing progress itself.
[23/02/2023, 01:24:22] Alice Lafferty: Hm ok. Who gets to decide when the 'equilibrium' is reached?
[23/02/2023, 01:25:32] Alice Lafferty: I agree that some of the good institutions of civilisation are lost with libertarianism, and that is its big stumbling block.
[23/02/2023, 01:25:50] Alex Regueiro: There's so much attraction to that. I'd love it if that were enough for humans to thrive, but since we are social beings (insofar as our survival is concerned, let alone our flourishing), it is not nearly enough. And like I say, it is far too vague and binary a criterion anyway. Apply it to the real world and quickly you find all sorts of indeterminacies and paradoxes pop up.
[23/02/2023, 01:26:30] Alice Lafferty: What if liberty is more important than thriving? I know this sounds stupid but just think about it.
[23/02/2023, 01:26:42] Alex Regueiro: Beyond that, it's a purely negative principle, that offers no orientation for life, at an individual or societal level.
[23/02/2023, 01:29:04] Alex Regueiro: Ah, now that is the challenge. We can only strive towards it, and ensure negative feedback mechanisms (democratic or partially democratic?) are in place that pull us back towards this equilibrium. This is a highly multi-dimensional space we're working in, mind you. So, with my mathematician's hat on, an incredibly difficult optimisation problem. Hence my comment about complexity and fragility and opposing radical changes (which are liable to ruin everything).
[23/02/2023, 01:29:20] Alex Regueiro: I don't think this idea stands up to scrutiny.
[23/02/2023, 01:29:32] Alex Regueiro: What would make you think that?
[23/02/2023, 01:30:26] Alice Lafferty: What if I happen to be born into a civilisation which has collectively decided that in order 'to maintain order', I am never allowed to step outside without covering my face, or I will be stoned to death. And this is just a 'sad necessity', but ah well for the greater good etc.
[23/02/2023, 01:30:39] Alex Regueiro: I say this on the basis I personally see no attraction in it, and my experience in this world suggests that entirely "liberated" (footloose, if you will) people are if anything much less happy than people with much less freedom in their lives.
[23/02/2023, 01:30:52] Alice Lafferty: It doesn't have to stand up to scrutiny - it's a subjective value.
[23/02/2023, 01:31:08] Alex Regueiro: Sure, but what's its basis for you, then?
[23/02/2023, 01:31:40] Alice Lafferty: What if the functioning of the whole system makes life unbearable for some of the individuals?
[23/02/2023, 01:32:00] Alex Regueiro: That clearly violates the principle I stated in that comment though. There are all sorts of equally and more stable societies that permit much greater individual liberty.
[23/02/2023, 01:32:16] Alex Regueiro: Arguably such a prejudiced society is inherently unstable, in fact.
[23/02/2023, 01:32:35] Alex Regueiro: At least in the very long run
[23/02/2023, 01:33:18] Alice Lafferty: But according to principles of social conservatism, there is no way of 'being sure' though right? Erring always on the side of caution means these kind of social arrangements can continue for a very long time unmodified.
[23/02/2023, 01:33:19] Alex Regueiro: Oh, I'm not saying this principle is the only basis for morality. Far from it. I'm just saying it's a good guiding principle for political organisation.
[23/02/2023, 01:34:14] Alex Regueiro: Well, see my above comment, but ultimately there is no clear cut-off between "erring on the side of caution" and "letting great injustices prevail". That's just something we have to live with.
[23/02/2023, 01:34:39] Alice Lafferty: It seems fundamentally wrong to me to appropriate human beings into a civilisation in order to maintain the functioning of that civilisation.
[23/02/2023, 01:34:50] Alex Regueiro: But if every bright spark like Marx comes along and thinks he has everything figured out in his head, that solves all the evils of the present political/socioeconomic system... be warned!
[23/02/2023, 01:34:51] Alice Lafferty: I can't really see how it's justified.
[23/02/2023, 01:35:18] Alex Regueiro: I never said anything of the sort
[23/02/2023, 01:35:40] Alice Lafferty: Yeah that these kind of injustices prevail is unacceptable to me.
[23/02/2023, 01:35:53] Alex Regueiro: Reread my principle maybe. Not saying I stated it perfectly, but it's a first approximation, and maybe the best I could give right now in this context.
[23/02/2023, 01:36:02] Alice Lafferty: But that is exactly what's happening?
[23/02/2023, 01:36:15] Alex Regueiro: Fine. So every society on earth now is imperfect in some way, it has injustices. Let's revolutionise them all!
[23/02/2023, 01:37:07] Alice Lafferty: I know you're joking but yes, basically that is preferable to allowing people to control others.
[23/02/2023, 01:37:10] Alex Regueiro: These are not "liberal conservative" societies in the remotest form. (I'm sure you have Saudi Arabia or the like in mind.)
[23/02/2023, 01:37:42] Alex Regueiro: Define "control". There's plenty of people controlling over people in liberal-capitalist systems.
[23/02/2023, 01:37:48] Alex Regueiro: The way you do it is called money.
[23/02/2023, 01:38:51] Alice Lafferty: They all essentially attempt to balance individual liberty with bigger picture functionality right? So there's a spectrum of arrangements which favour one or the other more strongly.
[23/02/2023, 01:39:26] Alex Regueiro: But like I said, this (certainly imperfect) principle of liberal conservatism that I gave on the spot (since you asked for one) is not the basis for an ethical system, just a political one. Yes, they're intertwined, but I'm not going to give an all-encompassing ethical system here. God knows I'd fail hopelessly.
[23/02/2023, 01:39:49] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's certainly one scale on which to envisage political systems. And a useful one.
[23/02/2023, 01:40:05] Alex Regueiro: Where the right balance is... that's the ultimate question.
[23/02/2023, 01:40:12] Alice Lafferty: Hm, I cannot be controlled with money. So long as I never enter into debt, which I would not.
[23/02/2023, 01:40:19] Alex Regueiro: Often based on other ethical principles.
[23/02/2023, 01:40:39] Alice Lafferty: I'm not asking for an ethical system.
[23/02/2023, 01:40:40] Alex Regueiro: So take this principal as a necessary but not sufficient one for a good society/nation.
[23/02/2023, 01:40:50] Alice Lafferty: That's what I'm saying!
[23/02/2023, 01:40:52] Alex Regueiro: Ah, but you are. We all are.
[23/02/2023, 01:41:11] Alex Regueiro: Money *is* the ability to command other people's labour. Adam Smith said so himself, and he was right.
[23/02/2023, 01:41:50] Alice Lafferty: My liberty is not infringed by being unable to command the labour of others.
[23/02/2023, 01:43:21] Alex Regueiro: No, but you infringe on other people's liberty every time you spend money.
[23/02/2023, 01:44:23] Alice Lafferty: Even libertarianism falls on this scale, just heavily weighted towards individual liberty. And eg. Taliban controlled Afghanistan on the other. It seems like the claim you're making is too vague, is all.
[23/02/2023, 01:45:07] Alice Lafferty: Do you have a model society you can point to which got the balance right?
[23/02/2023, 01:45:13] Alice Lafferty: *In your opinion?
[23/02/2023, 01:45:19] Alex Regueiro: Yep. So take take the principle of liberal conservatism that I pulled out of my had as necessary but not sufficient, like I say. Finding the exact equilibrium point is of course an extraordinarily difficult question, else we would already be living in a perfect society. üòâ
[23/02/2023, 01:45:26] Alex Regueiro: And sorry, I could have been clearer about that at the start.
[23/02/2023, 01:45:41] Alex Regueiro: We've jumping around a bit between (related) topics here, though... so forgive me.
[23/02/2023, 01:46:27] Alice Lafferty: How so? Libertarianism does not forbid forming economic contracts with others. I do not see this as a mechanism of control because it is entered into freely.
[23/02/2023, 01:47:46] Alice Lafferty: Yes sorry, it's completely fine
[23/02/2023, 01:47:53] Alex Regueiro: I'd prefer to say it's just modest. But like you say, libertarianism is too heavily weighted towards individual liberty (well, you might not say "too"), and likewise theocracies are invariably too heavily weighted towards social cohesion and stability. The grey zone in-between is where all the interesting discussion is to be had.
[23/02/2023, 01:48:29] Alex Regueiro: Maybe I'm stating the obvious there, but I just want to hammer home that point, since I certainly admit this balance isn't easy to find!
[23/02/2023, 01:48:36] Alice Lafferty: What allows you to discount those two examples so readily though?
[23/02/2023, 01:49:01] Alex Regueiro: Mainly other ethical principles... which we shan't go into right now
[23/02/2023, 01:49:05] Alice Lafferty: Maybe the Taliban have got the balance right. After all, they technically have greater genetic fitness than anyone else.
[23/02/2023, 01:49:08] Alex Regueiro: Just because it's a whole new can of worms
[23/02/2023, 01:50:24] Alex Regueiro: In a capitalist system (in fact, any society in which you have currency), people are essentially forced to accrue said currency in order to obtain things they can't produce for themselves.
[23/02/2023, 01:50:26] Alice Lafferty: None of this is wrong but I guess I don't see what point you're really committing too. 'There is a balance to be struck between individual freedom and some other metric like cohesion' and then haven't gone any further.
[23/02/2023, 01:50:38] Alice Lafferty: Everyone already agrees with this
[23/02/2023, 01:50:40] Alex Regueiro: And thus submit themselves to the command of others, in some sense.
[23/02/2023, 01:50:51] Alex Regueiro: To those who havem oney
[23/02/2023, 01:51:02] Alex Regueiro: In order to earn their own money, and commands others' labour in turn
[23/02/2023, 01:51:13] Alex Regueiro: Don't get me wrong, I don't think that's particularly immoral. Adam Smith didn't either. But it's certainly true.
[23/02/2023, 01:51:46] Alice Lafferty: Hm isn't this just freely entering into a contract?
[23/02/2023, 01:52:02] Alex Regueiro: I've set a necessary principle, for a start. I mean, we could formalise this and describe it game theoretically, which might be really interesting, but over my head (certainly for this hour of the night!)
[23/02/2023, 01:53:06] Alice Lafferty: Hm I'd be interested to hear what you have to say about this but we can save it for another time if you'd prefer
[23/02/2023, 01:53:09] Alex Regueiro: No, because like I say you don't really have a choice but to play this game. This merry-go-round of earning and spending money. I mean, you could go do a Ted Kaczynski or something, but good luck with that. He spent years preparing and even he failed.
[23/02/2023, 01:53:33] Alex Regueiro: Sure. I'd be interested in thinking about it more too. I'd need to flesh out my thoughts, for sure!
[23/02/2023, 01:53:44] Alex Regueiro: I mean, they're very fuzzy in my head right now
[23/02/2023, 01:54:25] Alice Lafferty: This is just classic liberalism I guessü§î The choice to participate in the economy can still be framed as a free one out of push.
[23/02/2023, 01:55:08] Alex Regueiro: Oh incidentally, I didn't reply about Bauman, sorry. Have you heard of "liquid modernity"? That's his term. Another neo-Marxist philosopher, with whom I agree in much of his analysis, but probably not much of his solution, from what I can gather. Though I really need to read more, like I said.
[23/02/2023, 01:55:27] Alice Lafferty: Yes I have heard the term
[23/02/2023, 01:55:29] Alex Regueiro: I think we're just deceiving ourselves if we call that a voluntary contract.
[23/02/2023, 01:55:48] Alice Lafferty: I will look him up thanksüëç
[23/02/2023, 01:55:52] Alex Regueiro: Of course, pinning down exactly what freedom/liberty means is a really difficult task in its own right.
[23/02/2023, 01:56:00] Alex Regueiro: (More truisms, yes...)
[23/02/2023, 01:56:13] Alex Regueiro: Cool. Let me know if you end up reading anything interesting from him!
[23/02/2023, 01:56:44] Alice Lafferty: I guess it goes something like 'I desire to not starve to death' -> 'I will act freely on my desire by obtaining food via the economy'.
[23/02/2023, 01:57:09] Alice Lafferty: Actual coercion by others is still absent here I think.
[23/02/2023, 01:57:38] Alex Regueiro: That's fair enough in one sense, as a concept of liberty, but I think when you inspect it closer, it becomes very difficult to differentiate itself from what we intuitively think of as "coercion" or "restraint".
[23/02/2023, 01:59:18] Alice Lafferty: I do make a distinction between obstructing someone's personal freedom and simply depriving them of something. They're not the same.
[23/02/2023, 01:59:18] Alex Regueiro: You could use that same argument on slave labour (among many other horrors), for example. "I desire not to be harmed or killed" -> "I will act freely on my desire to work dutifully for my master."
[23/02/2023, 01:59:30] Alex Regueiro: It's nothing more than an expression of the human will to survive, and basic rationality.
[23/02/2023, 01:59:47] Alice Lafferty: Slavery is explicitly forbidden under the NAP. It obviously contradicts the right to bodily autonomy.
[23/02/2023, 01:59:53] Alice Lafferty: You cannot own another person.
[23/02/2023, 02:00:48] Alex Regueiro: Once you really unpack that (unfortunately I don't have great examples at end), you'll see what a large and hazy middle ground there is! A spectrum from one end to the other. And not even one-dimensional.
[23/02/2023, 02:00:58] Alice Lafferty: I may have to go to bed soon
[23/02/2023, 02:01:35] Alex Regueiro: Aha, another law! You see, if you start with libertarianism, you take one of two paths, and either end up in total anarchy, or some highly moderated version of liberalism where the moderating principles take centre stage.
[23/02/2023, 02:01:48] Alice Lafferty: There are a few difficult cases but usually it's quite easy to distinguish between acts of commission and acts of omission.
[23/02/2023, 02:02:16] Alex Regueiro: Me too. Though now I realise I should be putting some readings together heh...
[23/02/2023, 02:02:32] Alice Lafferty: It's not really 'another law' so much as a conclusion of the overriding principle of personal autonomy.
[23/02/2023, 02:03:03] Alice Lafferty: Of course it's moderated to quite a large extent compared to eg. the animal kingdom
[23/02/2023, 02:03:25] Alex Regueiro: That's what I used to think. But once you really ponder these things, you realise that almost nothing is clearcut. Such clean binaries almost never exist in the real world. That's what I found at least.
[23/02/2023, 02:04:12] Alex Regueiro: This is the fallacy of the rationalist, really. A very human tendency to reduce, simplify, rationalise all behaviours into neat categories. But a folly nonetheless.
[23/02/2023, 02:04:34] Alex Regueiro: A human tendency and in particular a tendency of the Enlightened man, I should say
[23/02/2023, 02:05:00] Alex Regueiro: Which we all certainly are, living and having grown up in the milieu we do.
[23/02/2023, 02:05:37] Alice Lafferty: They were right though - everything is quantifiable.
[23/02/2023, 02:06:12] Alex Regueiro: That's almost one of my tenets: true binaries exist only in the abstract, everything else is an approximation. Some excellent, some utterly specious.
[23/02/2023, 02:06:27] Alice Lafferty: Can you think of an example where a case is ambiguously coercive?
[23/02/2023, 02:06:30] Alex Regueiro: Really? Is meaning quantifiable? Is love?
[23/02/2023, 02:06:51] Alice Lafferty: Haha, when did you become such a hippie!
[23/02/2023, 02:06:56] Alice Lafferty: But yes of course it is
[23/02/2023, 02:07:42] Alice Lafferty: Uh I mean a case in which it's unclear whether coercion has occurred.
[23/02/2023, 02:08:32] Alex Regueiro: I think the one of playing the 'game' of earning/spending currency in order to survive and flourish works well, in fact.
[23/02/2023, 02:09:37] Alice Lafferty: Well, I will just restate that being unable to obtain food does not mean you have been coerced.
[23/02/2023, 02:09:45] Alex Regueiro: It all boils down to agency really. So the trolley problem is very relevant in that sense, if you want an abstract example.
[23/02/2023, 02:09:53] Alex Regueiro: Why not?
[23/02/2023, 02:10:18] Alice Lafferty: Withholding something from someone is not coercion.
[23/02/2023, 02:10:46] Alex Regueiro: So if renders you unable to obtain food by physically restraining you from getting hold of it, how is that different on the level of principle?
[23/02/2023, 02:11:02] Alex Regueiro: So if someone*
[23/02/2023, 02:11:18] Alice Lafferty: Physically restricting someone's freedom of movement violates the NAP
[23/02/2023, 02:11:47] Alice Lafferty: Simply owning something and not giving it away is perfectly legal.
[23/02/2023, 02:13:19] Alex Regueiro: Ahh!
[23/02/2023, 02:13:23] Alex Regueiro: But what is this magical NAP?
[23/02/2023, 02:13:30] Alex Regueiro: Whence derives its legitimacy?
[23/02/2023, 02:13:40] Alex Regueiro: Did God dictate it to Moses on Mount Sinai?
[23/02/2023, 02:13:42] Alice Lafferty: The force of the state
[23/02/2023, 02:13:54] Alex Regueiro: Philosophical legitimacy üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 02:14:30] Alice Lafferty: There's no such thing and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. All rules, laws and norms are enforced by violence or the threat of violence, and nothing else.
[23/02/2023, 02:14:57] Alice Lafferty: Where does whichever flavour of liberal conservatism you hold derive its legitimacy?
[23/02/2023, 02:15:10] Alex Regueiro: That's true from one perspective. But now, what makes one system better than another?
[23/02/2023, 02:15:41] Alex Regueiro: I may actually have meant conservative liberalism now, come to think of it. I always get the two mixed up hah. Oh well.
[23/02/2023, 02:15:46] Alice Lafferty: Nothing, particularly. I'd prefer to live in one in which I was minimally aggressed by ithers.
[23/02/2023, 02:15:57] Alice Lafferty: Surely they're basically the same thing...
[23/02/2023, 02:16:15] Alex Regueiro: You'd think so, but apparently not according to political scientists...
[23/02/2023, 02:16:31] Alex Regueiro: A bit like how social democracy and democratic socialism are so very different. Though I think the difference less marked here?
[23/02/2023, 02:16:38] Alice Lafferty: Tomato, tomato (doesn't really work over text but yeah)
[23/02/2023, 02:17:02] Alex Regueiro: Okay. But why should others agree to that wish of yours?
[23/02/2023, 02:17:08] Alex Regueiro: We've gone back to first principles here hah
[23/02/2023, 02:17:22] Alice Lafferty: I don't think I know what democratic socialism is really.
[23/02/2023, 02:17:24] Alex Regueiro: It will take a loong time to get all the way to libertarianism or the likes, if it's even possible!
[23/02/2023, 02:17:41] Alice Lafferty: They don't have to. The entire contract with the state is opt-in.
[23/02/2023, 02:17:52] Alex Regueiro: It's a myth. I mean, it exists only in the abstract, there's been no real-world example.
[23/02/2023, 02:18:12] Alex Regueiro: Then why should you get to create the state?
[23/02/2023, 02:18:55] Alex Regueiro: But anyway: it's state-owned means of production and welfare but with a democratically governed state. Loosely speaking.
[23/02/2023, 02:19:21] Alice Lafferty: I guess if enough people want to live in such a state, then they can get together and do so.
[23/02/2023, 02:20:33] Alice Lafferty: How is this different from communism?
[23/02/2023, 02:20:46] Alice Lafferty: Or is orthodox marxism not democratic
[23/02/2023, 02:20:57] Alex Regueiro: It's basically the reaction to Marxists who didn't like what they saw in the USSR.
[23/02/2023, 02:21:01] Alex Regueiro: Orwell most famously
[23/02/2023, 02:21:38] Alice Lafferty: Oh right
[23/02/2023, 02:21:40] Alex Regueiro: Depends very much you read it. Marx and Engels would like to think so, but there is some real dissonance in their writings, from what I've seen.
[23/02/2023, 02:22:36] Alice Lafferty: I know that it's demo - cratic in the very literal sense of mass-rule, but did they actually prescribe regular elections and stuff like that.
[23/02/2023, 02:22:42] Alex Regueiro: Aha! So now we've arrived at the question of, what sort of state should people choose to create together? And from here, we can talk about the means of deciding, etc. But really we just come full to circle, to some of the questions we've just been discussing (and others).
[23/02/2023, 02:22:59] Alex Regueiro: You're a big fan of first-principle derivations aren't you? üòÄ
[23/02/2023, 02:23:35] Alex Regueiro: I don't think that was stipulated in any sort of manifesto or handbook, but they surely would have advocated that, yes.
[23/02/2023, 02:23:51] Alex Regueiro: Would have and would. They still exist today, of course.
[23/02/2023, 02:24:06] Alice Lafferty: Maybe an individual or a group of individuals can draw up a 'constitution' of sorts. Others can say, 'yeah count me in', or can decline. Issues get hashed out. And yeah
[23/02/2023, 02:24:55] Alice Lafferty: It wouldn't be so different from the establishment of any other kind of state, because as I said they all exist on a spectrum.
[23/02/2023, 02:26:08] Alice Lafferty: I'm not naive enough to think it would be as simple as that!
[23/02/2023, 02:26:46] Alex Regueiro: Nice idea, but alas, there is only limited and resources! We can't all have our own experiment.
[23/02/2023, 02:26:49] Alice Lafferty: But I've thought about it a bit over the beginning of this year, esp about how the police and land rights would function.
[23/02/2023, 02:26:59] Alex Regueiro: land and resources*
[23/02/2023, 02:27:49] Alice Lafferty: Well really very small groups of people start communes all the time (let's NOT mention their success rates...)
[23/02/2023, 02:27:59] Alex Regueiro: Hah
[23/02/2023, 02:28:00] Alex Regueiro: Sure
[23/02/2023, 02:28:08] Alex Regueiro: But they still exist within states
[23/02/2023, 02:28:17] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see what you mean
[23/02/2023, 02:28:18] Alex Regueiro: And have often come into conflict with those states.
[23/02/2023, 02:29:07] Alice Lafferty: Yes so the way of achieving a 'true' libertarian society would be either political reform of an already existing country or annexing land.
[23/02/2023, 02:29:31] Alice Lafferty: By annexe I mean 'purchase' probably! Ie. with the consent of the former state/inhabitants!
[23/02/2023, 02:29:37] Alex Regueiro: I realise we haven't even touched positive liberty in this conversation... which throws even more confusion into this scene. But just as well we stayed clear of that, I'd say. (I don't care much for the concept.)
[23/02/2023, 02:29:56] Alice Lafferty: Ok I'm sorry to say this but I hate the term positive liberty.
[23/02/2023, 02:30:16] Alice Lafferty: Oh ha I didn't even read to the bottom of your text because I got so triggered by the phrase
[23/02/2023, 02:30:16] Alex Regueiro: No surprise then that closest you get to a libertarian society in the history of humanity came about this way. üòâ
[23/02/2023, 02:30:19] Alex Regueiro: i.e. the USA
[23/02/2023, 02:30:36] Alice Lafferty: Total nonsense concept
[23/02/2023, 02:30:37] Alex Regueiro: Haha yes. And I was being understated. I hate it too.
[23/02/2023, 02:30:39] Alex Regueiro: Yes
[23/02/2023, 02:30:40] Alex Regueiro: !
[23/02/2023, 02:31:01] Alex Regueiro: Some people insist it's the "more important" sort of liberty though. Well, a lot of contemporary leftists.
[23/02/2023, 02:31:02] Alex Regueiro: Gah
[23/02/2023, 02:31:28] Alice Lafferty: I have a real soft spot for US style libertarianism.
[23/02/2023, 02:31:48] Alice Lafferty: And I realise it's emotive to a large extent.
[23/02/2023, 02:32:49] Alice Lafferty: Yeah they mean like 'privilege' or 'luxury'.
[23/02/2023, 02:33:19] Alice Lafferty: I mean, the affinity for the aesthetic aspects, the flag and guns and pick up trucks
[23/02/2023, 02:33:31] Alex Regueiro: Yeee haaaaw, let me go get meself some sweet beautiful guns! I'll take my pick-up truck.
[23/02/2023, 02:33:58] Alice Lafferty: ü§†
[23/02/2023, 02:34:08] Alex Regueiro: Hahah that's freakish. We both just thought of guns and pick-up trucks. Or maybe not. It's just culturally ingrained!
[23/02/2023, 02:34:21] Alex Regueiro: Stereotypical American libertarianism
[23/02/2023, 02:34:38] Alice Lafferty: It is! Goes to show how shallow my understanding of it is haha
[23/02/2023, 02:35:27] Alice Lafferty: By flag I meant the Gadsden flag not the Confederate flag by the wayüòÖ
[23/02/2023, 02:35:30] Alex Regueiro: That's fair. There's something oddly attractive about it, even though I realise it's no way to run a society. The US from its inception today is a fascinating sociopolitical experiment. Incredibly successful and disastrous at the same time.
[23/02/2023, 02:36:06] Alex Regueiro: Mine too then. And with American parents, I should no better.üòï
[23/02/2023, 02:36:22] Alex Regueiro: But hey, some stereotypes are fun, we have that to admit to ourselves...
[23/02/2023, 02:36:28] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah of course
[23/02/2023, 02:36:53] Alex Regueiro: know*
[23/02/2023, 02:36:55] Alex Regueiro: damnit!
[23/02/2023, 02:37:11] Alex Regueiro: It's getting to that hour where I start typing purely phonetically...
[23/02/2023, 02:37:14] Alice Lafferty: Kind of interesting that you feel so strongly about like the preservation of British culture.
[23/02/2023, 02:37:24] Alex Regueiro: Haha, why not both?
[23/02/2023, 02:37:34] Alice Lafferty: Haha same. When I tried to type 'soft spot' I first typed 'suspect'
[23/02/2023, 02:38:47] Alex Regueiro: Not just British. Pretty much any moderately successful culture, to some degree. And I don't think we should preserve everything about British culture (well, we haven't). Or anything close to that. It's just I think there are still many things worth preserving, rather than trying to burn it out and recreate some fantastical utopia from the ground up, like the far left have always wanted to.
[23/02/2023, 02:39:21] Alex Regueiro: For the record, there are a number of aspects to American culture worth preserving/adopting. Just... less? üòâ
[23/02/2023, 02:39:26] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, so just complex civilisation as a principle.
[23/02/2023, 02:40:07] Alice Lafferty: How do you explain the prevalence of 'RETVRN'-like sentiments throughout almost all of history then?
[23/02/2023, 02:40:40] Alice Lafferty: I think I'm mentally associating you with your social group to a large extent.
[23/02/2023, 02:42:06] Alice Lafferty: This twitter thread is kind of funny on this point: https://mobile.twitter.com/inherent_itgirl/status/1628089806180712462
[23/02/2023, 02:42:22] Alex Regueiro: Possibly the best (read: most hilarious) dating profile I've seen was some sort of neo-Confederate East Asian girl whose profile pics were just sexy poses with her guns and passive-aggressive captions about libs or something. It was all totally sincere.
[23/02/2023, 02:42:51] Alice Lafferty: Not to be taken _too_ seriously but there is a point in there
[23/02/2023, 02:43:10] Alex Regueiro: The technical term is Inmydayism!
[23/02/2023, 02:43:13] Alice Lafferty: ? Haha Was she Asian-American at least?
[23/02/2023, 02:43:35] Alex Regueiro: Hah thanks. I actually used to be quite anti-monarchist until a few years ago when I became more ambivalent!
[23/02/2023, 02:43:49] Alex Regueiro: I have some vague recollection she was adopted, but yeah
[23/02/2023, 02:43:56] Alex Regueiro: Like, White American parents
[23/02/2023, 02:44:09] Alex Regueiro: I didn't speak to her, just checked out the profile in detail, because it fascinated me üòâ
[23/02/2023, 02:44:46] Alex Regueiro: Oh and she lived in England...
[23/02/2023, 02:45:05] Alice Lafferty: I'm beginning to find the anti-woke stuff to be as tiring as the woke stuff
[23/02/2023, 02:45:17] Alice Lafferty: What a life story
[23/02/2023, 02:46:29] Alice Lafferty: Yeah it's one of those things... like how there's no group of people more racially diverse than a white supremacist meet-up.
[23/02/2023, 02:46:41] Alex Regueiro: Hah. There's absolutely truth in that! I've thought the exact same thing, at least at a meta-level.
[23/02/2023, 02:47:29] Alex Regueiro: I don't think it will ever become that tiresome for me, given the times we live in ‚Äì but yes, it can get pretty annoying. Especially when espoused by simpletons who completely lack nuance.
[23/02/2023, 02:48:20] Alice Lafferty: It's probably just due to overexposure for me
[23/02/2023, 02:48:28] Alex Regueiro: In fact there's too much of it in our salon group, I'm afraid ‚Äì on WhatsApp more than in person. (It's partly why I didn't want to invite you originally.) At the same time, they're good people, with good intentions, and fairly intelligent... for the most part hah!
[23/02/2023, 02:48:45] Alex Regueiro: Well, ranging from very intelligent to at least somewhat, I'd say
[23/02/2023, 02:48:54] Alex Regueiro: But most importantly we're BEAUTIFUL AND DIVERSE.
[23/02/2023, 02:49:22] Alice Lafferty: Yeah, the anti-progressive project is beginning to seem like a futile one, you can never go far enough back.
[23/02/2023, 02:49:23] Alex Regueiro: It's a natural reaction. You're literally a different generation to me. You don't have many years of pre-woke memories.
[23/02/2023, 02:49:39] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[23/02/2023, 02:49:59] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I wasn't complaining particularly, it's nice to be in the group.
[23/02/2023, 02:50:12] Alice Lafferty: I imagine they all work in industries where they get exposed to it a lot and need somewhere to vent!
[23/02/2023, 02:50:19] Alex Regueiro: I've never considered myself a real reactionary, since I consider the reactionary mindset every bit as moronic as the utopian/revolutionary one.
[23/02/2023, 02:50:38] Alex Regueiro: No, I know you weren't. But I could tell it was at least at the back of your mind hah.
[23/02/2023, 02:50:46] Alex Regueiro: (Maybe the forefront)
[23/02/2023, 02:50:50] Alex Regueiro: And it sometimes is with me too, trust me
[23/02/2023, 02:51:02] Alex Regueiro: Yes, some of them do, for sure.
[23/02/2023, 02:51:40] Alice Lafferty: I've said this before but it's remarkably diverse, being as it is more or less ideologically opposed to racial progressivism.
[23/02/2023, 02:51:50] Alice Lafferty: No I know
[23/02/2023, 02:51:57] Alex Regueiro: I'd actually like to shift the focus away from juste railing against wokery. Which is sometimes fun/cathartic, but can easily verge onto monotony and facile nonsense.
[23/02/2023, 02:52:24] Alex Regueiro: Yes, and the trans movement. (Well, one or two have partial sympathy, but no more.)
[23/02/2023, 02:52:34] Alex Regueiro: Okay, we have gays, not trannies... but still
[23/02/2023, 02:52:37] Alice Lafferty: Seems like a good idea. Perhaps towards something more creative rather than pure negation.
[23/02/2023, 02:53:08] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I'd be keen to hear your ideas about this, in fact. üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 02:53:32] Alex Regueiro: My friend Caitlin urged me to take the group in that direction at the end of last year, as I was starting to take on more repsonsibility
[23/02/2023, 02:53:33] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I am literally a parvenueü´£
[23/02/2023, 02:53:37] Alice Lafferty: Not really my place
[23/02/2023, 02:54:06] Alex Regueiro: Because she doesn't have faith in Laurie doing that, being a neo-conservative Spiked writer... as nice a fellow as he is (in my view) hah!
[23/02/2023, 02:54:24] Alex Regueiro: Maybe not in a group setting, but to me you're more than welcome to. Nay, I'm inviting you to.
[23/02/2023, 02:54:32] Alice Lafferty: I think there's a sizeable number of gay people who want to slough off the trans stuff, you've heard of 'LGB drop the T'
[23/02/2023, 02:54:34] Alex Regueiro: Doing AI at the salon tomorrow sounds like a step in the right direction.
[23/02/2023, 02:55:08] Alex Regueiro: Of course. Very popular these days, and rightly so. There's the LGB Alliance even, a big charity. They have an huge ongoing legal case that Mermaids brought against them.
[23/02/2023, 02:55:17] Alex Regueiro: Trying to get them stripped of charity status
[23/02/2023, 02:55:34] Alex Regueiro: Tesh and Jake are both involved with the LGB Alliance, at least tangentially
[23/02/2023, 02:55:41] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[23/02/2023, 02:55:55] Alice Lafferty: Oh really I didn't know this
[23/02/2023, 02:56:17] Alice Lafferty: Yeah should be good!
[23/02/2023, 02:56:59] Alice Lafferty: Sorry my attention is fading in and out a bit
[23/02/2023, 02:57:00] Alex Regueiro: It's still a minority of LGB people unfortunately, but growing. As more and more realise that radical trans activists don't really have their best interests in heart, despite the glib slogans of the movement.
[23/02/2023, 02:57:24] Alex Regueiro: Haha mine too. If I look at what I'm writing now it will probably make no sense to me.
[23/02/2023, 02:57:47] Alice Lafferty: Gender dysphoria does not strictly have anything to do with being gay.
[23/02/2023, 02:58:09] Alice Lafferty: I guess it's just the general 'non-conformity', or esp effeminacy that has the lumped together.
[23/02/2023, 02:58:43] Alex Regueiro: Do you want to recommend any specific articles? It might be too 'basic', but I could even do Blake Lemoine's article and a contrary response by an AI researcher / cognitive scientist, or something.
[23/02/2023, 02:59:01] Alice Lafferty: The tenses in this sentence are very interesting to say the leastüòÑ
[23/02/2023, 02:59:31] Alex Regueiro: I meant to write "tomorrow" at the end
[23/02/2023, 02:59:36] Alex Regueiro: Then it makes sense...?!
[23/02/2023, 02:59:50] Alice Lafferty: I never read the actual article itself, but yeah?
[23/02/2023, 02:59:59] Alice Lafferty: Stuff by Gwern is good too.
[23/02/2023, 03:00:15] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's something almost as loose as that. Which I take issue with. It's not a coherent / logically consistent movement, if you really probe. Sustained by contradictions and slogans. But fallacious at its heart.
[23/02/2023, 03:00:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes!
[23/02/2023, 03:00:39] Alex Regueiro: I don't think I know him/her
[23/02/2023, 03:01:17] Alice Lafferty: https://gwern.net/about
[23/02/2023, 03:01:22] Alex Regueiro: But if you can find me something good that denies Lambda / ChatGPT / Bing Chat is sentient, then perfect!
[23/02/2023, 03:01:34] Alice Lafferty: He's written stuff about neural nets but it's buried amongst some other crap
[23/02/2023, 03:01:44] Alice Lafferty: Sorry probably not a good suggestion at such short notice.
[23/02/2023, 03:01:47] Alex Regueiro: You were keen to volunteer to help out a few weeks ago, so here's your chance! üòÄ
[23/02/2023, 03:01:49] Alex Regueiro: I mean it
[23/02/2023, 03:01:52] Alex Regueiro: I'd really appreciate it
[23/02/2023, 03:01:57] Alice Lafferty: Ok I can do that I thinkü´°
[23/02/2023, 03:02:00] Alex Regueiro: Because I'm not going to have much time to put it together tomorrow
[23/02/2023, 03:02:02] Alex Regueiro: Thank you!
[23/02/2023, 03:02:13] Alex Regueiro: This is a subject I know you're well read on, as well
[23/02/2023, 03:02:47] Alice Lafferty: Would an article from LessWrong be acceptable? The quality of posts tends to be quite high. I'll do my best to check it for reliability but I don't have that much at my disposal.
[23/02/2023, 03:03:21] Alice Lafferty: Or maybe a proper phil of mind paper which engages with artificial minds.
[23/02/2023, 03:03:49] Alice Lafferty: But short too ofc
[23/02/2023, 03:04:06] Alex Regueiro: I don't really know their stuff well enough, but I suspect it would be fine. It looks like the style of their posts varies a little, so I'm sure you could find something that would fit. üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 03:04:57] Alex Regueiro: That would be cool, and I've been tempted to pick excerpts from academic papers before, but I'm worried (and Laurie in particular) that they might end up too technical, full of jargon, or overly-specific.
[23/02/2023, 03:05:09] Alex Regueiro: Still, a high-level one might work.
[23/02/2023, 03:05:22] Alex Regueiro: Don't worry TOO much about fact checking. We can always issue a caveat hah.
[23/02/2023, 03:06:14] Alex Regueiro: Oh, incidentally, have you ever read any Pessoa? Not in the original Portuguese, I suppose, but still...
[23/02/2023, 03:06:26] Alice Lafferty: Of course. I only only read the entry-level layman stuff anyway, so I will pick something I've found intelligble.
[23/02/2023, 03:06:51] Alice Lafferty: I absolutely love Pessoa. Yes I've read The Book of Disquiet & some of his poems.
[23/02/2023, 03:07:23] Alex Regueiro: Discussing reactionaries reminded me of a nice way he labelled himself, which I can sympathise a lot with.
"a British-style conservative, that is to say, liberal within conservatism and absolutely anti-reactionary"
[23/02/2023, 03:08:12] Alice Lafferty: Ok, nice. I see what you were getting at with the lib con vs con lib distinction.
[23/02/2023, 03:08:45] Alex Regueiro: Great. Well, if you think of any poems that might serve as good introductions to his work, I'd be very grateful to receive them!
[23/02/2023, 03:08:54] Alice Lafferty: Not surprised he was very level-headed about politics although he didn't discuss it much in the novel.
[23/02/2023, 03:08:54] Alex Regueiro: No pressure though, I don't mean to burden you for recommendations heh.
[23/02/2023, 03:09:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. He had interesting mixed views on Salazar too, who is often considered one of the most enlightened right-wing dictators. At least of the 20th C.
[23/02/2023, 03:09:56] Alice Lafferty: It's fine. The Book of Disquiet has lots of good sort of one-liners too. Probably the writer who I am most temperamentally similar to.
[23/02/2023, 03:10:11] Alice Lafferty: What time do you need the article by?
[23/02/2023, 03:10:16] Alex Regueiro: You've read some academic texts within phil mind though, I gather. But anyway, that sounds good.
[23/02/2023, 03:10:38] Alex Regueiro: Excellent. I shall have a look at that then. Thanks!
[23/02/2023, 03:11:15] Alice Lafferty: Yes but am lost when neuroscience is introduced
[23/02/2023, 03:11:15] Alex Regueiro: I'll check out Yeats at some point too üòâ
[23/02/2023, 03:12:01] Alex Regueiro: So am I largely. The philosophical stuff I half-understand, and the computer science and physics side maybe 3/4, but still... it's so cross-disciplinary, parts of it are bound to lose anyone but the true expert.
[23/02/2023, 03:12:15] Alex Regueiro: By 5:00 should be okay.
[23/02/2023, 03:13:00] Alice Lafferty: üëç I will select for readability & provocativeness
[23/02/2023, 03:13:31] Alex Regueiro: I might read the short ones in Portuguese, even. For a good challenge. And hope my Spanish and Italian gets me most of the way there!
[23/02/2023, 03:13:45] Alex Regueiro: I always have faith in you when it comes to provocativeness!
[23/02/2023, 03:14:18] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I've attempted some more of James Ladyman's, is that right that your supervisor used to work with him?
[23/02/2023, 03:15:03] Alice Lafferty: Woah, I thought Portuguese was like the odd one out in the romance languages. Do you speak it well?
[23/02/2023, 03:15:13] Alice Lafferty: I don't remember if you said.
[23/02/2023, 03:15:19] Alex Regueiro: Intellectual provocativeness, that is... Take that as compliment, my dear Alice.
[23/02/2023, 03:15:30] Alex Regueiro: Phonetically yes
[23/02/2023, 03:15:34] Alex Regueiro: I'd be hopeless
[23/02/2023, 03:15:42] Alex Regueiro: Written... not nearly so bad üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 03:15:52] Alice Lafferty: Haha I will
[23/02/2023, 03:16:26] Alice Lafferty: Oh ok. Well tell me what you think of them in the original Portuguese
[23/02/2023, 03:16:45] Alex Regueiro: Yep! He's a good guy, with solid philosophical views on most things, from what I could tell. Tell me the names of the articles some other time, if you would.
[23/02/2023, 03:17:39] Alice Lafferty: Ok I have one more rec for you! https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/254/1/quinqual.htm
[23/02/2023, 03:17:41] Alex Regueiro: Will do. Though it could be my fatigue is masquerading as bravado right now, and I'll be left floundering when I pick them up!
[23/02/2023, 03:18:32] Alice Lafferty: Quining Qualia by Dennett - this and the attention schema theory are what made me take eliminative materialism seriously.
[23/02/2023, 03:18:42] Alice Lafferty: Just if you're interested of course :)
[23/02/2023, 03:19:38] Alice Lafferty: Haha tiredness can sometimes mimic inebriation, with the attending grandiosity!
[23/02/2023, 03:19:42] Alice Lafferty: But I'm sure you'll be fine
[23/02/2023, 03:19:43] Alex Regueiro: Hah, sounds fun! You know what a Quinean I am...
[23/02/2023, 03:20:09] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I very much find that! I feel kind of tipsy now.
[23/02/2023, 03:20:09] Alice Lafferty: It's been over an hour since I said I ought to go to bed.
[23/02/2023, 03:20:11] Alex Regueiro: Do you too?
[23/02/2023, 03:20:15] Alice Lafferty: Exactly!
[23/02/2023, 03:20:25] Alice Lafferty: Yes a bit
[23/02/2023, 03:20:29] Alex Regueiro: I am, thank you. üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 03:20:56] Alex Regueiro: Generally, not necessarily now. But good to know I'm not unique that way!
[23/02/2023, 03:21:15] Alex Regueiro: Yes, sleep beckons me too...
[23/02/2023, 03:21:36] Alice Lafferty: I think it's common! And your eg. reflex times are literally similar to a drunk person.
[23/02/2023, 03:21:51] Alice Lafferty: Ok well goodnight, see you tomorrow or later on today hopefully
[23/02/2023, 03:21:53] Alex Regueiro: Thanks for a fascinating conversation. I hope I didn't come off too antagonistic. It was a good spirited dbeate!
[23/02/2023, 03:22:15] Alex Regueiro: debate, even... üò¥
[23/02/2023, 03:22:25] Alice Lafferty: Not at all! I can just be kind of blunt and aggressive
[23/02/2023, 03:22:45] Alex Regueiro: My reflex times are similar to a drunk person in the BEST of circumstances. Right now they're... god knos.
[23/02/2023, 03:23:09] Alice Lafferty: Han
[23/02/2023, 03:23:14] Alice Lafferty: *ha!
[23/02/2023, 03:23:22] Alice Lafferty: Pft
[23/02/2023, 03:23:39] Alex Regueiro: It's okay. I'm sure people have sometimes thought the same of me too! Anyway, I'm glad you weren't bothered.
[23/02/2023, 03:24:07] Alex Regueiro: I know you just made that typo out of solidarity for me.
[23/02/2023, 03:24:09] Alex Regueiro: Gracias
[23/02/2023, 03:24:14] Alex Regueiro: Y buenas noches
[23/02/2023, 03:24:18] Alex Regueiro: Hasta ma√±ana
[23/02/2023, 03:24:52] Alice Lafferty: Buona notte
[23/02/2023, 03:26:02] Alex Regueiro: Merci. üòò
[23/02/2023, 11:36:45] Alice Lafferty: I think Ned Block is probably the best person working in phil of mind who has written not only against machine consciousness but also true machine intelligence.
[23/02/2023, 11:40:37] Alice Lafferty: https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/beyond-hyperanthropomorphism 

This piece is the best but too long obviously. I can perhaps try and edit it down.
[23/02/2023, 11:41:04] Alice Lafferty: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockhead_(thought_experiment)

Or you could just use this simple overview.
‚Äé[23/02/2023, 11:43:01] Alice Lafferty: ‚Äéimage omitted
[23/02/2023, 11:43:26] Alice Lafferty: And much more concise.
[23/02/2023, 11:44:12] Alice Lafferty: Alternatively, I have found some strong-AI-skeptic articles in mainstream outlets like The Atlantic I think.
[23/02/2023, 13:32:26] Alice Lafferty: I mean, I just realised that you could much more simply use The Chinese Room thought experiment itself as an argument against the feasibility of strong AI (although I personally think it is flawed). That might be the best option.
[23/02/2023, 15:20:20] Alex Regueiro: Guten tag!
[23/02/2023, 15:20:37] Alex Regueiro: Just skimmed it very quickly and it looks really nice indeed
[23/02/2023, 15:20:56] Alex Regueiro: Not sure how easy it will be to edit down (I mean, looks tricky), but feel free. And I'll include that then. üôÇ
[23/02/2023, 15:22:29] Alex Regueiro: Haha very good
[23/02/2023, 15:23:01] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure it's a substitute for a text, but I could include it as a bonus! That might be fun.
[23/02/2023, 15:23:14] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I think it's deeply flawed too. Facile, even.
[23/02/2023, 15:23:29] Alex Regueiro: If you don't think that article can be edited down well, then sure, pick one of those.
[23/02/2023, 15:23:42] Alex Regueiro: I'm off to the gym now, but I'll have a proper look at everything when I'm back.
[23/02/2023, 15:23:48] Alex Regueiro: And thank you! You've been really helpful.
[23/02/2023, 16:27:13] Alice Lafferty: I'd guess most people would have already read it too. Despite this I still think it's a good starting point to discuss the consciousness problem... some common rebuttals, such as the systems response/the comic etc, could be included as well?
[23/02/2023, 16:28:11] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I'm not sure as he pursues several different points throughout.

[23/02/2023, 16:33:55] Alex Regueiro: "Lemoine may have been predestined to believe in LaMDA. He grew up in a conservative Christian family on a small farm in Louisiana, became ordained as a mystic Christian priest, and served in the Army before studying the occult. Inside Google‚Äôs anything-goes engineering culture, Lemoine is more of an outlier for being religious, from the South, and standing up for psychology as a respectable science."
[23/02/2023, 16:34:00] Alex Regueiro: Just read that... interesting! I wasn't aware.
[23/02/2023, 16:34:14] Alex Regueiro: Of being in involved in mystical/occult stuff.
[23/02/2023, 16:34:53] Alice Lafferty: Haha nor was I. Explains a lot.
[23/02/2023, 16:35:17] Alex Regueiro: Especially because he came across kind of woke in his interviews
[23/02/2023, 16:35:18] Alex Regueiro: But yeah
[23/02/2023, 16:35:27] Alex Regueiro: Backgrounds can combine in odd ways
[23/02/2023, 16:35:56] Alex Regueiro: I wonder if just including an interesting transcript for one of the texts might be useful?
[23/02/2023, 16:36:07] Alice Lafferty: So is the format basically to provide argument(s) for and against AI consciousness?
[23/02/2023, 16:36:40] Alice Lafferty: I was just about to say that maybe some guy's perception is not the most rigorous argument for AI consciousness.
[23/02/2023, 16:36:45] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, this seems to encapsulate his argument, though there's a fair bit of jargon (like SILTB, pseudotrait) that would need defining.
[23/02/2023, 16:36:50] Alice Lafferty: Maybe steelman the position a bit more
[23/02/2023, 16:37:02] Alice Lafferty: Yeah exactly, you really need to read the whole thing
[23/02/2023, 16:37:10] Alex Regueiro: That's been growing on me too. I was never too convinced by his ramblings anyway.
[23/02/2023, 16:37:32] Alice Lafferty: I think this is a good idea too. But it's up to you. What do the others say?
[23/02/2023, 16:37:35] Alex Regueiro: It doesn't have to be, but I think that would be ideal.
[23/02/2023, 16:38:03] Alex Regueiro: Or we could fine two opinions that just differ morally on AI, even though both think strong AI is imminent.
[23/02/2023, 16:38:16] Alex Regueiro: Haven't had a chance to talk to others
[23/02/2023, 16:38:21] Alex Regueiro: I have some freedom to decide üôÇ

[23/02/2023, 16:39:31] Alice Lafferty: Bing, for example, does not make this same error.
[23/02/2023, 16:39:46] Alice Lafferty: You could include some of the crazy scarier ones from 'Sydney'?
[23/02/2023, 16:39:49] Alex Regueiro: Yes, that's a good one actually
[23/02/2023, 16:40:08] Alex Regueiro: I've seen similar response to (fairly basic) high school or university maths and physics questions.
[23/02/2023, 16:40:28] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[23/02/2023, 16:40:33] Alice Lafferty: I think like AI-optimist takes are thin on the ground form what I've seen..
[23/02/2023, 16:40:44] Alex Regueiro: Even two different transcripts could work
[23/02/2023, 16:40:50] Alex Regueiro: Enough to stimulate a decent discussion, in theory
[23/02/2023, 16:41:39] Alice Lafferty: My humble suggestion is to put the chatGPT transcripts + chinese room argument up against some transcripts of Bing conversations.
[23/02/2023, 16:41:57] Alice Lafferty: Could kind of comment on rate of progress there too.
[23/02/2023, 16:42:05] Alex Regueiro: I think reading transcripts is also something people will find fun, so yeah
[23/02/2023, 16:42:23] Alex Regueiro: I'm still tempted to leave the comic as a bonus item
[23/02/2023, 16:42:23] Alice Lafferty: Sorry if I'm being overbearing
[23/02/2023, 16:42:25] Alex Regueiro: But otherwise agree
[23/02/2023, 16:42:26] Alex Regueiro: not at all
[23/02/2023, 16:42:58] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I didn't mean the comic I meant the original formulation of the argument
[23/02/2023, 16:43:07] Alex Regueiro: Oh right
[23/02/2023, 16:43:17] Alex Regueiro: I read your message too quickly, my fault...
[23/02/2023, 16:43:27] Alice Lafferty: No it's fine
[23/02/2023, 16:43:33] Alex Regueiro: Still reeling from the gym hah
[23/02/2023, 16:43:44] Alex Regueiro: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-writing-ethics/672386/
[23/02/2023, 16:43:47] Alice Lafferty: Are you responsible for making the physical copies?
[23/02/2023, 16:43:51] Alex Regueiro: Is that one of the articles you were thinking of?
[23/02/2023, 16:44:09] Alex Regueiro: I could do, but was planning on taking advantage of Laurie and the Spiked office printer üòÄ
[23/02/2023, 16:44:10] Alice Lafferty: Hm maybe, although I am paywalled!
[23/02/2023, 16:44:21] Alice Lafferty: Ok!
[23/02/2023, 16:45:27] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's annoying. There's a site to get around it... let me check
[23/02/2023, 16:45:29] Alex Regueiro: Ah yes, https://archive.ph
[23/02/2023, 16:45:49] Alice Lafferty: Oh thanks
[23/02/2023, 16:45:50] Alex Regueiro: Possibly even the Wayback machine. But I was specifically recommended that one in the past
[23/02/2023, 16:45:53] Alex Regueiro: for articles
[23/02/2023, 16:46:32] Alex Regueiro: The other trick is to type in the name of the article in Google then click the link. And in private browsing mode. When Google is the 'referrer', it usually works
[23/02/2023, 16:49:38] Alex Regueiro: Maybe we can include part of that article, plus the example you gave?
[23/02/2023, 16:49:46] Alex Regueiro: And then a scary Bing Chat example (or two)?
[23/02/2023, 16:50:00] Alice Lafferty: This looks good, do you think it's the right length?
[23/02/2023, 16:50:22] Alex Regueiro: Could do the whole thing to be honest. It's not excessively long. Let me see...
[23/02/2023, 16:50:38] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I'm sure it's fine
[23/02/2023, 16:52:37] Alex Regueiro: There's an example in the article too, which is helpful
[23/02/2023, 16:53:26] Alex Regueiro: Well, more than one in fact
[23/02/2023, 16:56:00] Alice Lafferty: Maybe that will be ok on its own then?
[23/02/2023, 17:01:45] Alex Regueiro: Let's just include a fairly brief Bing Chat example or two for the second "text"?
[23/02/2023, 17:01:58] Alex Regueiro: We have room
[23/02/2023, 17:02:15] Alex Regueiro: Maybe the one about the dog?
[23/02/2023, 17:02:19] Alex Regueiro: or another one you have in mind?
[23/02/2023, 17:05:04] Alex Regueiro: Maybe one of the more unhinged ones too?
[23/02/2023, 17:05:47] Alice Lafferty: I know the example made famous by the NYT is when it declared its love for a journalist.
[23/02/2023, 17:07:57] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[23/02/2023, 17:08:00] Alex Regueiro: I didn't see that one
[23/02/2023, 17:08:07] Alex Regueiro: Link me?
[23/02/2023, 17:08:09] Alex Regueiro: That would be cool to include

[23/02/2023, 17:11:33] Alice Lafferty: Have you got a plan then
[23/02/2023, 17:11:56] Alex Regueiro: I'm putting together the document as we speak
[23/02/2023, 17:12:10] Alice Lafferty: Great
[23/02/2023, 17:12:18] Alice Lafferty: I will let you get on with it

[23/02/2023, 17:57:46] Alex Regueiro: And yes, this is super last minute!
[23/02/2023, 17:58:01] Alex Regueiro: Took me longer than I thought to cut it down. And I was looking at other things.
[23/02/2023, 18:03:13] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to go get ready now... will be there 7:15 roughly. üòä
[23/02/2023, 18:03:20] Alex Regueiro: Hope you can make it!
[23/02/2023, 18:27:47] Alice Lafferty: Looks goodüëç
[23/02/2023, 18:28:11] Alice Lafferty: Sorry, I think I misplaced the emphasis a bit. I thought we were going to be discussing whether or not AI was truly conscious or something like that.
[23/02/2023, 18:28:29] Alice Lafferty: So sorry that what I provided wasn't that useable in the end!
[23/02/2023, 19:04:54] Alex Regueiro: Thanks
[23/02/2023, 19:05:10] Alex Regueiro: No worries. I really should have been more explicit.
[23/02/2023, 19:07:40] Alex Regueiro: That‚Äôs an equally interesting and valid subject, just I thought this fit the tone of the salon slightly better. More concerned with the sociological side. Though you‚Äôll see my first question it‚Äôs about the strong AI question, so pretty close.
[23/02/2023, 19:08:03] Alex Regueiro: Could do a separate one on the hard problem of consciousness some other time. üòâ
[23/02/2023, 19:08:46] Alex Regueiro: Don‚Äôt be silly, you very much pointed me in the direction of both texts!
[23/02/2023, 19:08:51] Alex Regueiro: So thank you
[23/02/2023, 19:09:28] Alice Lafferty: Be there at 7:30 approx
[23/02/2023, 19:10:51] Alex Regueiro: If you‚Äôre coming, I should let you know I‚Äôm running late (sorry). Been rushing around like a madman today. Feel free to show up any time before 8:00‚Ä¶ or even just after.
[23/02/2023, 19:13:30] Alex Regueiro: Excellent
[23/02/2023, 19:13:57] Alice Lafferty: I'm getting intermittent signal on the tube
[23/02/2023, 19:14:05] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[23/02/2023, 19:14:32] Alex Regueiro: I‚Äôll be there 7:35 or so. Feel free to go up without me though. Same room as last time.
[23/02/2023, 19:37:57] Alice Lafferty: I'm sitting at the bar
[23/02/2023, 19:42:10] Alex Regueiro: Okay. 5 mins away. üòä

[24/02/2023, 00:31:37] Alice Lafferty: I tried to call you earlier to ask for directions to Tottenham Court Road station.

[24/02/2023, 00:31:51] Alex Regueiro: I'm very relieved

[24/02/2023, 00:31:56] Alex Regueiro: What happened with the taxi?
[24/02/2023, 00:32:07] Alice Lafferty: Yeah failed
[24/02/2023, 00:32:20] Alice Lafferty: Ha sorry!!
[24/02/2023, 00:32:25] Alex Regueiro: Was worried you got stranded there or something
[24/02/2023, 00:32:30] Alex Regueiro: Ah okay, so you took the train back?
[24/02/2023, 00:32:32] Alice Lafferty: How was your journey back?
[24/02/2023, 00:32:37] Alex Regueiro: Oh well. At least you're back!
[24/02/2023, 00:33:19] Alex Regueiro: Not too bad thanks. Had to wait for the 3rd train... but not too long. Usual clownish scheduling.
[24/02/2023, 00:34:04] Alex Regueiro: No worries. I probably overreacted. üôÇ
[24/02/2023, 15:07:11] Alice Lafferty: Sent you the money for the drink

[25/02/2023, 01:09:26] Alice Lafferty: Ha that is exactly what I thought when I got this notification. Piss off
[25/02/2023, 01:09:36] Alice Lafferty: Thanks
[25/02/2023, 01:09:53] Alice Lafferty: Watched this one as well
[25/02/2023, 01:10:27] Alice Lafferty: He was right! 'I do not have a single constructive proposal!'
[25/02/2023, 01:10:47] Alice Lafferty: Have you ever read Zeno's Conscience by Italo Svevo?
[25/02/2023, 01:11:11] Alice Lafferty: It has gotten a bit buried in the chat I think
[25/02/2023, 01:19:31] Alex Regueiro: Haha yep
[25/02/2023, 01:19:40] Alex Regueiro: I love his passion for nihilism though
[25/02/2023, 01:20:39] Alex Regueiro: "Gentlemen, I despise each and everyone of you."
[25/02/2023, 01:20:44] Alex Regueiro: So refreshing, to be honest
[25/02/2023, 01:20:58] Alex Regueiro: No... I'm going to go look it up
[25/02/2023, 01:21:24] Alex Regueiro: Yes. Don't blame for the absolute twaddle that followed. Well, some of it is vaguely interesting!

[25/02/2023, 17:28:35] Alice Lafferty: Guessing not electorally successful though..
[25/02/2023, 17:29:08] Alice Lafferty: I only mentioned it because the speech reminded me of the philosophical conclusion of the novel, the sort of digust with everything.

[25/02/2023, 17:42:49] Alice Lafferty: By the way I am going to delete my WhatsApp account for a bit. Not sure about my continued attendance at salons, I don't perform that well in group settings. But I will get back to you.

[12/03/2023, 23:03:41] Alex Regueiro: Oh, that's the one you linked me to before.
[12/03/2023, 23:03:59] Alice Lafferty: It's not important or anything
[12/03/2023, 23:04:06] Alice Lafferty: Oh sorry!
[12/03/2023, 23:04:10] Alex Regueiro: Not bad, I suppose. The usual ups and downs, but kept busy with work at least. (And a little tennis)
[12/03/2023, 23:04:13] Alex Regueiro: How about you?
[12/03/2023, 23:04:22] Alice Lafferty: Maybe I've already talked about this before, I've completely forgotten.
[12/03/2023, 23:04:24] Alex Regueiro: No no, thanks for reminding me.
[12/03/2023, 23:04:39] Alice Lafferty: Ok nice
[12/03/2023, 23:05:05] Alex Regueiro: We talked a little about space exploration and colonisation before. The same time you showed me that short story of Asimov I think, which was cool.
[12/03/2023, 23:05:30] Alice Lafferty: Oh right yeah
[12/03/2023, 23:05:44] Alex Regueiro: I think we shared similar views on the subject? Anyway I'll get back to you after reading that papers. üòâ
[12/03/2023, 23:05:50] Alex Regueiro: And we can resume that discussion eh
[12/03/2023, 23:05:50] Alice Lafferty: I just have three topics of discussion which I rotate anyway.
[12/03/2023, 23:05:58] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[12/03/2023, 23:06:03] Alex Regueiro: It's not a bad plan to be honest
[12/03/2023, 23:06:03] Alice Lafferty: Is there going to be another salon soon by the way?
[12/03/2023, 23:06:07] Alex Regueiro: Even if it's not true
[12/03/2023, 23:06:17] Alex Regueiro: Yep, on the 22nd üôÇ
[12/03/2023, 23:06:19] Alex Regueiro: Up for it?

[12/03/2023, 23:06:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[12/03/2023, 23:06:44] Alice Lafferty: Probably not, but I was just interested.
[12/03/2023, 23:07:16] Alex Regueiro: How have you been anyway? Able to recharge our batteries at least, I hope?
[12/03/2023, 23:07:25] Alice Lafferty: Ok well, I was just checking in :) but I may be out for a bit again.
[12/03/2023, 23:07:36] Alex Regueiro: Oh right
[12/03/2023, 23:08:59] Alice Lafferty: Talking in person sucks so much because I have to devote like 40% of my mental energy to thinking about how I from different perspectives and controlling my facial muscles.
[12/03/2023, 23:09:01] Alice Lafferty: But yeah
[12/03/2023, 23:09:10] Alex Regueiro: Also that date rang a bell for some reason... so I checked and it turns out the Rach Vespers is playing then too. üëÄ
[12/03/2023, 23:09:39] Alice Lafferty: Oh thank you for reminding me, I hadn't noted that down anywhere
[12/03/2023, 23:09:40] Alex Regueiro: Oh Alice, don't worry about these things. People don't judge you as much as you think, I'm pretty sure.
[12/03/2023, 23:09:49] Alex Regueiro: Though if you don't fancy going to the salon anyway, that's really no problem
[12/03/2023, 23:10:29] Alex Regueiro: I have some odd mannerisms too, to be honest... one of the nice things about getting older (even at my modest age) is just automatically caring less about these things heh.
[12/03/2023, 23:10:34] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I realise a dynamic is arising where you have to constantly reassue me which is not really optimal!
[12/03/2023, 23:10:53] Alice Lafferty: *reassure
[12/03/2023, 23:10:59] Alice Lafferty: But I will be going shortly
[12/03/2023, 23:11:17] Alex Regueiro: Maybe it's not "optimal" but if it makes you less self-conscious I'm still happy to do it...
[12/03/2023, 23:11:56] Alex Regueiro: So I'll take that as a "things still aren't going great"... üôÅ
[12/03/2023, 23:12:05] Alice Lafferty: But it's bad, and getting to the point where I can't interact with anyone normally.
[12/03/2023, 23:12:10] Alex Regueiro: Oh well. Take more time alone if you need, whatever helps.
[12/03/2023, 23:12:21] Alex Regueiro: I'm really sorry to hear
[12/03/2023, 23:12:25] Alex Regueiro: How do you mean "normally" though?
[12/03/2023, 23:13:39] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, it probably feels like I'm grilling you here... not my intention
[12/03/2023, 23:21:33] Alex Regueiro: FYI, if you want company for that I'd more than happy to go too! But if you don't, that also works.
[12/03/2023, 23:21:39] Alex Regueiro: Be back in a bit
[12/03/2023, 23:23:04] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure whether you like real hugs, but I shall send you a virtual one, okay?! üòÄ
[13/03/2023, 04:54:01] Alice Lafferty: Thank you
[14/03/2023, 02:26:43] Alex Regueiro: So, I just finished reading the article you linked me to... super interesting, and I say that in earnest!
[14/03/2023, 02:27:37] Alex Regueiro: Just what I needed after reading a depressive (but evidently pretty accurate) article about Chomsky's hypocrisy over sociopolitics.
[14/03/2023, 02:28:07] Alex Regueiro: Anyway, really liked the perspective that the author / Ericke take
[14/03/2023, 02:28:41] Alex Regueiro: Lots of imaginative imagery and metaphor, not to mention sound scientific and philosophical reasoning.
[14/03/2023, 02:29:24] Alex Regueiro: I wouldn't dare comment much on the theological metaphors (other than saying I see where he was coming from), but it was all pretty effective in any case.
[14/03/2023, 02:30:43] Alex Regueiro: I'd like to have said I came up with this vision myself. In truth, I might say some of these ideas have occurred to me in the most nebulous and fleeting forms, but hardly so cogently.
[14/03/2023, 02:31:19] Alex Regueiro: It's an incredibly unique perspective given what dominates the mainstream discourse. His conclusion and exhortations are absolutely justified if you ask me.
[14/03/2023, 02:33:20] Alex Regueiro: Also, I think it appealed to me in its balance of sober realism (even tendency to catastrophise a bit) about the environment and human nature (or actually the nature of life in general), and on the other hand, a sort of life-affirming optimism (or at least high-mindedness?), as I see it.
[14/03/2023, 02:34:02] Alex Regueiro: It's genuinely a good antidote to the doom and gloom that you might think an essay on such a topic would gravitate towards!
[14/03/2023, 02:35:03] Alex Regueiro: I mean, a novel and encouraging way to reconceptualise boundaries to growth, the grand arc of human/life history, etc... what's not to like?
[14/03/2023, 02:36:20] Alex Regueiro: We can solve both grave environmental concerns, escape the Malthusian trap, and assuage our rather justified fears of destroying ourselves (and our spirits/souls?) through technological 'progress' and inter-human competition, with all its vices.
[14/03/2023, 02:37:30] Alex Regueiro: Even though the small romantic side of me has a lot of sympathy for Sagan and other's approaches (the exploratory spirit, human conquest, and whatnot), I think that ought to just be the icing on the cake. Certainly a subjective virtue of space exploration.
[14/03/2023, 02:39:21] Alex Regueiro: I was also worried the article might an advance a Nietzschean variety (will to power and the destiny of the ubermensch, blah blah) kind of argument, but yeah, it did well to avoid that. Or maybe that shouldn't surprise me, since it was written by a Christian scholar hah. I just noticed that at the end in fact.
[14/03/2023, 02:39:29] Alex Regueiro: What do you think of Sagan incidentally?
[14/03/2023, 02:40:03] Alex Regueiro: I haven't actually read his stuff, though I really enjoyed the film Contact (based on some story of his I believe).
[14/03/2023, 02:40:25] Alex Regueiro: Even on rewatch as a not-entirely-naive idealistic teenager, I dare say!
[14/03/2023, 02:41:33] Alex Regueiro: Eh, this has definitely stimulated lots of thoughts in spite of my fading alertness here...
[14/03/2023, 02:41:41] Alex Regueiro: Sorry, hope it's not too rambly.
[14/03/2023, 02:41:54] Alex Regueiro: Just thought I'd share it all while it was fresh in my head üòÄ
[14/03/2023, 02:42:35] Alex Regueiro: Also, now I see how you got introduced to negentropy! Or was it the other way round?
[14/03/2023, 02:43:33] Alex Regueiro: I need to ponder that more, and its relation to the 2nd law... but I do think there's some fair characterisation of life as a vaguely negentropic-increasing force (or motion).
[14/03/2023, 02:44:11] Alex Regueiro: I wonder if it can be equated with evolution and natural selection in some more well-defined way in fact.
[14/03/2023, 02:44:15] Alice Lafferty: Ok yes, I was worried about this part. I'm not sure 'cosmic laws of negentropy' is very scientific... 
Also, it does not really address 'the last question' problem, that negentropy only appears in exceptional pockets of an ultimately entropic universe.
[14/03/2023, 02:44:26] Alice Lafferty: But I'm glad that you enjoyed it!
[14/03/2023, 02:44:30] Alex Regueiro: BTW please don't feel obliged to reply now! I realise it's late, possibly even for you
[14/03/2023, 02:44:32] Alex Regueiro: Okay too late haha
[14/03/2023, 02:44:37] Alice Lafferty: It's something I was thinking about a lot particularly last year.
[14/03/2023, 02:45:38] Alex Regueiro: Yep, I'm trying to withhold full judgement on that aspect. But there may still be some adequate way to formalise this.
[14/03/2023, 02:45:44] Alex Regueiro: Even if it's not negentropy per se.
[14/03/2023, 02:46:14] Alice Lafferty: This appeal is not insignificant. It's very like self-abnegating in a good way. Like, the individual is just a subordinated to the goal of propagating intelligence.
[14/03/2023, 02:46:41] Alex Regueiro: For example, might negentropy-increasing pockets be (partly) self-sustaining despite an entropy-increasing universe? Indeed, at the cost of.
[14/03/2023, 02:46:42] Alice Lafferty: Haha, there's lots to say about it.
[14/03/2023, 02:46:50] Alex Regueiro: There really is haha
[14/03/2023, 02:47:04] Alex Regueiro: Curse you. Now I'm definitely not getting to bed at a decent time. Oh well, it was worth it.
[14/03/2023, 02:48:07] Alice Lafferty: I especially liked that humans appear as just vectors for some general principle of 'negentropy' or intelligence.
[14/03/2023, 02:48:12] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure it's necessarily self-abnegating, since individual, deeply personal aspirations, can still be in line with submitting yourself to some sort of higher cause/ideal.
[14/03/2023, 02:48:17] Alex Regueiro: Be it religious or otherwise!
[14/03/2023, 02:48:22] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I will go back and reply to your previous messagesüòÖ
[14/03/2023, 02:49:14] Alex Regueiro: Though this perspective definitely fits with the "Institute for Christian Studies" affiliation I initially skimmed over heh
[14/03/2023, 02:49:22] Alex Regueiro: No worries. At your own leisure hah
[14/03/2023, 02:49:45] Alice Lafferty: I literally don't know anything about him, I only know him as the 'pale blue dot' populariser type of figure.
[14/03/2023, 02:51:40] Alice Lafferty: I keep on misusing 'negentropy' and 'complexity'.
[14/03/2023, 02:51:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. The one aspect of this theory/vision I would say I have really given some thought time to is whether there exists a principle of the cosmos favouring life, of some kind. And what aspect of life (e.g. complexity, self-awareness, ethicality, "power", etc.) is bequeathed a law of long-term growth, if indeed any.
[14/03/2023, 02:52:40] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Probably not inaccurate, though he's far more multi-faceted than that, I would at least say. From the little I know of him, I mean.
[14/03/2023, 02:53:10] Alex Regueiro: We'll come back to this. There's some sort of connection but... certainly not clearcut.
[14/03/2023, 02:53:37] Alex Regueiro: Going to go grab something to eat, be right back. Should give you time to reply to my comments/questions if you like though. üòâ
[14/03/2023, 02:53:53] Alice Lafferty: Oküëç
[14/03/2023, 03:06:56] Alex Regueiro: Oh, you evidently already finished replying to my ramblings...
[14/03/2023, 03:07:43] Alex Regueiro: Do put Contact on your film list though, if you fancy a decent sci-fi!
[14/03/2023, 03:08:34] Alex Regueiro: Anyway thanks a lot for linking me to that. Twice, rather. I took up the suggestion the second time at least.
[14/03/2023, 03:09:19] Alice Lafferty: Sorry I did have a lot more to say on this but it's not coming to me at the moment.
[14/03/2023, 03:09:25] Alice Lafferty: Ok thanks
[14/03/2023, 03:09:42] Alex Regueiro: Do you have any misgivings about the thesis as a whole? Or just the relatively small points we've already brought up...
[14/03/2023, 03:10:04] Alex Regueiro: You can always write your own reply paper at some point. üòÄ
[14/03/2023, 03:10:20] Alice Lafferty: This seems to be the key problem though.
[14/03/2023, 03:10:20] Alex Regueiro: Would be a nice way to start your academic career eh!
[14/03/2023, 03:11:35] Alice Lafferty: Well, I was very enthusiastic about it the first time I read it, so, last year. I suppose now I'm more skeptical about the existence of a human-independent 'cosmic life-promoting principles'.
[14/03/2023, 03:12:08] Alex Regueiro: And of course we could just continue this discussion when and as inspiration comes to you.
[14/03/2023, 03:12:31] Alex Regueiro: I know the feeling well: having digested something a long time ago and had so many good thoughts that just refuse to respond to my bidding later on.
[14/03/2023, 03:13:04] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, this was what I was saying. I've really grappled with this (in my own way) over time. On and off through the years even
[14/03/2023, 03:13:41] Alice Lafferty: The 'cosmonautical principle' just be an obscurantism for some kind of mammalian power tripping, I mean.
[14/03/2023, 03:13:49] Alex Regueiro: I can't help but think there's *some* sort of principle like that, however, which is deeply intwined with natural selection (and the fact we're here). But it could just be wishful thinking and/or the anthropic principle at play here.
[14/03/2023, 03:13:49] Alice Lafferty: Very frustrating!
[14/03/2023, 03:14:08] Alex Regueiro: Very indeed
[14/03/2023, 03:15:06] Alice Lafferty: I guess natural selection is just fundamentally a stochastic process.
[14/03/2023, 03:15:07] Alex Regueiro: Hah. I mean, it could be, but I thought the author did a good job of distinguishing this from any sort of brutish will-to-power (or romantic-exploratory) narrative, at least.
[14/03/2023, 03:15:24] Alex Regueiro: Sure it is, but that doesn't preclude there being a guiding principle
[14/03/2023, 03:16:10] Alex Regueiro: Even though I consider all principles (including the ones of fundmanetal physics) to be inextricably human. The use Kantian line...
[14/03/2023, 03:16:14] Alice Lafferty: I guess natural selection would by definition select for something that reproduces itself.
[14/03/2023, 03:16:24] Alex Regueiro: right
[14/03/2023, 03:16:25] Alice Lafferty: There doesn't have to be a guiding principle
[14/03/2023, 03:17:01] Alex Regueiro: There doesn't, though I was just saying the two things aren't mutually exclusive.
[14/03/2023, 03:17:13] Alice Lafferty: Yep
[14/03/2023, 03:17:23] Alice Lafferty: Yes true
[14/03/2023, 03:17:43] Alice Lafferty: Complex life does seem accidental or a byproduct to me.
[14/03/2023, 03:18:01] Alice Lafferty: I realise this is very much not in the spirit of the paper!
[14/03/2023, 03:18:36] Alex Regueiro: I wonder this. You know, in some ways bacteria are much better at thriving and reproducing than we are. But life didn't stop at that level, not by a long way
[14/03/2023, 03:18:46] Alice Lafferty: Unless there's some mechanism by which natural selection sort of generates intentional intelligence, but then that all seems very spooky.
[14/03/2023, 03:19:02] Alex Regueiro: Hah no. This is the 'materialist Alice' coming to the fore again.
[14/03/2023, 03:19:10] Alice Lafferty: I mean of course it does
[14/03/2023, 03:19:55] Alice Lafferty: But I mean in like in some sense of history unfolding.
[14/03/2023, 03:20:10] Alex Regueiro: Ehh I have a problem with the notion of intentionality, to be honest. It's incredibly woolly.
[14/03/2023, 03:20:31] Alex Regueiro: (Intesionality is all fine and dandy though!)
[14/03/2023, 03:21:16] Alice Lafferty: Bleh sorry I am not up to this today for some reason.
[14/03/2023, 03:21:41] Alex Regueiro: I suppose you're thinking here like me of the "the goal of the universe is to create sentient life that comprehends itself" in an almost mystical self-referential way
[14/03/2023, 03:22:03] Alex Regueiro: Which I used to really like, but have massively cooled on, years ago.
[14/03/2023, 03:22:12] Alex Regueiro: Part of me still wants to believe ithough
[14/03/2023, 03:22:33] Alice Lafferty: I had lots of things I wanted to talk about, including a proper definition of entropy and also this concept of 'duty' but I've just lost all my threads. Abort
[14/03/2023, 03:22:37] Alex Regueiro: No worries really. I feel my mind isn't quite in top form right now either
[14/03/2023, 03:22:49] Alex Regueiro: Haha
[14/03/2023, 03:22:50] Alex Regueiro: All good
[14/03/2023, 03:23:02] Alex Regueiro: How about just pause, rather than abort though?!
[14/03/2023, 03:23:12] Alex Regueiro: Indefinite pause. TBC.
[14/03/2023, 03:24:01] Alice Lafferty: Yes same.
[14/03/2023, 03:24:10] Alice Lafferty: Thank you and sorry again!
[14/03/2023, 03:24:27] Alex Regueiro: FYI here's the rather one-sided but still interesting (and damning) article on Chomsky I read earlier. Don't feel in the slightest obliged, as always. https://newcriterion.com/issues/2003/5/the-hypocrisy-of-noam-chomsky
[14/03/2023, 03:24:30] Alex Regueiro: Not at all üôÇ
[14/03/2023, 03:24:39] Alice Lafferty: I obviously sent you this kind of long paper to read then can't even defend it afterwards
[14/03/2023, 03:24:57] Alex Regueiro: What have you been up to today/tonight before I rudely disturbed you with my excited and disorganised thoughts?
[14/03/2023, 03:25:24] Alice Lafferty: Oh thanks. I saw he was catching flak for his comments on LLMs also.
[14/03/2023, 03:25:45] Alice Lafferty: Nothing really, what about you?
[14/03/2023, 03:26:18] Alex Regueiro: You're hardly obliged to defend (or critique) it! Anyway I really liked it, and sympathised with it, as I said. My misgivings were pretty small
[14/03/2023, 03:26:21] Alice Lafferty: It's fine, I really wanted to hear your opinion it.
[14/03/2023, 03:26:36] Alice Lafferty: Ok good
[14/03/2023, 03:26:45] Alex Regueiro: Oh! I'd be curious if you come across them again; feel free to link me.
[14/03/2023, 03:26:49] Alice Lafferty: Which is why I accidentally sent it to you twice!
[14/03/2023, 03:27:02] Alex Regueiro: I've done that before too... possibly to you!
[14/03/2023, 03:27:42] Alice Lafferty: Ok
[14/03/2023, 03:28:20] Alex Regueiro: Hey, that's not a hundredth as bad as when I send my dad an article and he recommends it back to me a few days later, completely forgetting that I sent him it in the first place! üòÑ
[14/03/2023, 03:28:27] Alex Regueiro: I mean, he's done that once, maybe twice, but...
[14/03/2023, 03:28:43] Alice Lafferty: HA that is really good
[14/03/2023, 03:28:48] Alex Regueiro: The joys of old age (senility?)
[14/03/2023, 03:29:00] Alice Lafferty: Hopefully notü§û
[14/03/2023, 03:29:23] Alex Regueiro: Nothing much either. Was working a lot last week but been taking it pretty easy the last few days.
[14/03/2023, 03:29:43] Alex Regueiro: Yeah. I tease him about it sometimes but he's really not that far gone... yet...
[14/03/2023, 03:30:25] Alice Lafferty: Ok good, is this for the genetics company?
[14/03/2023, 03:30:48] Alice Lafferty: Or I've probably confused that with something else you were talking about
[14/03/2023, 03:30:54] Alex Regueiro: This is for the London startup actually. Hadn't worked for them for a few months before... 3 weeks ago?
[14/03/2023, 03:31:20] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, the one that had kind of ground to a halt for a bit?
[14/03/2023, 03:31:22] Alex Regueiro: But I'm still doing bits and pieces for that guy (one man company) too
[14/03/2023, 03:31:25] Alex Regueiro: Yep
[14/03/2023, 03:31:38] Alex Regueiro: Now that they've secured funding
[14/03/2023, 03:31:48] Alex Regueiro: http://tably.com if you're curious. Honestly can't remember if I linked you before
[14/03/2023, 03:32:46] Alex Regueiro: It's kind of mundane at one level, but rather more interesting at a tech/problem-solving level, I'd say
[14/03/2023, 03:32:51] Alice Lafferty: Oh right, to me this looks like accounting software but I wouldn't know to be honest
[14/03/2023, 03:33:32] Alice Lafferty: Oh or is it even more general than that?
[14/03/2023, 03:33:40] Alex Regueiro: That's definitely one use case. It's more generally for data manipulation, processing, aggregation... all sorts of tasks. Think spreadsheets + database tools, but highly collaborative/distributed + big-data capabilities.
[14/03/2023, 03:34:31] Alice Lafferty: Oh I see
[14/03/2023, 03:34:41] Alex Regueiro: A much more sophisticated and capable version of Google Sheets, if you like. Or sort of Google Sheets crossed with Jupyter Notebook (if you've heard of that).
[14/03/2023, 03:35:18] Alice Lafferty: Website looks impressiveüëÄ
[14/03/2023, 03:35:41] Alice Lafferty: Ok. I've never worked in a office so no but I see what you mean.
[14/03/2023, 03:35:44] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's pretty slick. I think all the copy on this one is new though. (I helped a lot with the copy for the old one that was up for a couple of years.)
[14/03/2023, 03:35:56] Alex Regueiro: And I pray you will never have to!
[14/03/2023, 03:35:59] Alex Regueiro: Nor I, again
[14/03/2023, 03:36:22] Alice Lafferty: When will it be finished? Or is it available already?
[14/03/2023, 03:36:50] Alex Regueiro: No more thoughts about your vocation in life, I suppose? You have plenty of time though, and should damn well take it! Save yourself the mini crises I had.
[14/03/2023, 03:36:53] Alex Regueiro: Good question
[14/03/2023, 03:37:00] Alex Regueiro: It's very close to an initial demo release
[14/03/2023, 03:37:04] Alex Regueiro: alpha-stage
[14/03/2023, 03:37:26] Alex Regueiro: The biggest thing holding that up is actually probably the thing I have to work on heh
[14/03/2023, 03:37:43] Alice Lafferty: Ok that will be exciting?
[14/03/2023, 03:38:09] Alice Lafferty: Ha, is it even worth my asking what that is or would it be over my head...
[14/03/2023, 03:38:26] Alice Lafferty: I was just about to say that I need to find something to occupy myself because my brain is turning to soup ha
[14/03/2023, 03:38:34] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, it's always fun to know your work is getting used in used in practice. Even if I only contributed a tiny part of the whole hting.
[14/03/2023, 03:39:07] Alice Lafferty: Do you own shares in the startup or is that not how it works?
[14/03/2023, 03:39:08] Alex Regueiro: It's not so much over your head as just really not worth explaining hah. I mean, it's such a specific technical problem...
[14/03/2023, 03:39:22] Alex Regueiro: Nope, since I'm just contracting. The other guys working full-time have some shares though.
[14/03/2023, 03:39:28] Alex Regueiro: Share options rather, but yeah
[14/03/2023, 03:39:50] Alice Lafferty: How many programmers working on it in total?
[14/03/2023, 03:40:21] Alice Lafferty: I do find the tech industry interesting, not that I particularly understand the nature of the actual work involved.
[14/03/2023, 03:40:26] Alex Regueiro: Hah, hardly! Read any more of the Feynman lectures? Or perused philosophy papers? I was impressed you worked your way through some of Ladyman's stuff.
[14/03/2023, 03:40:54] Alice Lafferty: Ok, I'll take your word for that
[14/03/2023, 03:40:54] Alex Regueiro: I think 6 or 7, including the founder.
[14/03/2023, 03:42:39] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I'm not trying to shrug you off, but trust me, there are few things less worthwhile, considering the elaborate context I'd have to provide. üòâ
[14/03/2023, 03:43:21] Alice Lafferty: Yeah I'm sure
[14/03/2023, 03:43:32] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to float Tably to my dad.
[14/03/2023, 03:43:44] Alice Lafferty: Not that he has any involvement in the software his firm uses..
[14/03/2023, 03:44:11] Alex Regueiro: Oh, well I'd be curious what he thinks of it nonetheless! So thank you. I'm sure the founder would be too.
[14/03/2023, 03:44:13] Alice Lafferty: I'm going to run a grassroots PR campaign.
[14/03/2023, 03:44:18] Alex Regueiro: haha
[14/03/2023, 03:45:15] Alex Regueiro: It's software that's engineered for democracy, being highly distributed and collaborative, so what better?
[14/03/2023, 03:45:48] Alice Lafferty: Sort of vaguely, but my head keeps being turned by phil of physics instead.
[14/03/2023, 03:46:34] Alice Lafferty: I don't think you can get anything actually useful out of it without a science background though.
[14/03/2023, 03:46:36] Alice Lafferty: Oh well
[14/03/2023, 03:46:42] Alex Regueiro: I get that. Philosophical questions about physics drew me even from my undergrad days. Part of my disenchantment with my degree you could say! I just didn't know it was a real field back then
[14/03/2023, 03:47:00] Alex Regueiro: Plus it's important to have the background in actual physics before beginning to philosophise... at an academic level I mean
[14/03/2023, 03:47:20] Alex Regueiro: If you're doing it for fun, then by all means skip the tedious formalisms!
[14/03/2023, 03:47:53] Alex Regueiro: Ladyman's papers are pretty approachable at least. I mean, not easy, but compared to some of the other stuff out there.
[14/03/2023, 03:47:54] Alice Lafferty: Is this different from Google Sheets and the others? Maybe it is
[14/03/2023, 03:48:47] Alex Regueiro: I'm always happy to recommend other good authors/papers on philosophy of science. Not everything is super technical, even in phil physics.
[14/03/2023, 03:48:48] Alice Lafferty: I was watching this lecture series. https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/emergent-multiverse
[14/03/2023, 03:49:14] Alice Lafferty: Some were given by a guy called David Wallace, who made it all seem really accessible.
[14/03/2023, 03:49:40] Alice Lafferty: By the way, I had no idea how much of this work was/is being done at Oxford.
[14/03/2023, 03:49:49] Alice Lafferty: Oh I completely forgot to tell you
[14/03/2023, 03:49:55] Alex Regueiro: The main difference is the efficiency with which it does that and the avoidance of conflicts, allowing you to work much more smoothly with very large datasets and lots of people.
[14/03/2023, 03:49:57] Alice Lafferty: Yes exactly
[14/03/2023, 03:50:14] Alex Regueiro: Oh yes, his name came up quite a few times in my course!
[14/03/2023, 03:50:35] Alice Lafferty: They should hire you to do sales as well!
[14/03/2023, 03:50:51] Alex Regueiro: Looks interesting. I have a lot of time for Everettian interpretations generally, though I think MWI is ontologically too extravagant at the end of the day.
[14/03/2023, 03:51:08] Alice Lafferty: Oh really, that's interesting. So has some academic repute... can't really tell from the outside.
[14/03/2023, 03:51:19] Alex Regueiro: Haha I'm not sure I'm doing that good a job of explaining it! I'm probably prone to reeling off platitudes in fact...
[14/03/2023, 03:51:34] Alex Regueiro: But so is 95% of the tech startup industry, after all
[14/03/2023, 03:52:00] Alice Lafferty: He didn't say so explicitly but he kind of hinted at being a structural realist too.
[14/03/2023, 03:52:18] Alex Regueiro: I think Wallace moved from Oxford to somewhere else a few years back, mind you...
[14/03/2023, 03:52:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah it's rapidly become very popular within the physics, or at least phil physics world, I gather.
[14/03/2023, 03:53:18] Alice Lafferty: I believe one of his arguments was that the MWT was actually fairly 'simple' and its denigrators were misuing Occam's Razor.
[14/03/2023, 03:53:50] Alice Lafferty: I think Uni of Pittsburgh
[14/03/2023, 03:54:06] Alex Regueiro: I really should set up a Dropbox folder or something for you, with interesting accessible philosophy papers. Not that I'm an expert, but still might be handy for you, whenever you fancy picking soemthing up!
[14/03/2023, 03:54:40] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, I recall him saying something like that, though I forget his exact argument.
[14/03/2023, 03:56:23] Alice Lafferty: Obviously I'm not the target market. But it seems like that technology which actually non-ostentatiously provides lots of value. I mean, better than the gazillion startups which provide minutely faster food delivery or whatever
[14/03/2023, 03:56:42] Alice Lafferty: Ha that would be nice if it's not trouble!
[14/03/2023, 03:57:34] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I feel the same way! It's not super sexy as a startup, but it provides clear legitimate (perhaps even quantifiable) value to businesses and their operations.

[14/03/2023, 03:58:37] Alex Regueiro: I hardly even went that far south in Oxford, sadly!

[14/03/2023, 04:00:00] Alex Regueiro: Is that Magdalene college? I genuinely forget.
[14/03/2023, 04:00:17] Alex Regueiro: I know it's taken from the edge of Christchurch meadows
[14/03/2023, 04:00:26] Alex Regueiro: But not Christchurch, unless I'm very mistaken
[14/03/2023, 04:00:33] Alice Lafferty: It is
[14/03/2023, 04:01:06] Alex Regueiro: Ah good. Perhaps I have a few more years before my memory completely fails me...
[14/03/2023, 04:01:49] Alice Lafferty: Ha, in all seriousness though you seem to rememeber an awful lot about physics you did at undergrad level.
[14/03/2023, 04:02:00] Alice Lafferty: Even though that was over a decade ago!

[14/03/2023, 04:02:43] Alex Regueiro: But thanks
[14/03/2023, 04:02:46] Alice Lafferty: It's been under a year since I wad doing Theology and I've forgotten loads of it..
[14/03/2023, 04:03:00] Alex Regueiro: What brought you to Oxford incidentally?
[14/03/2023, 04:03:11] Alex Regueiro: Just fancied a day out?
[14/03/2023, 04:03:19] Alice Lafferty: Ha, which college is this a part of?
[14/03/2023, 04:03:30] Alice Lafferty: Oh University College?
[14/03/2023, 04:03:33] Alice Lafferty: That is confusing
[14/03/2023, 04:03:38] Alex Regueiro: Yeah... or at least right next to University
[14/03/2023, 04:03:55] Alice Lafferty: Brother wanted to visit so I went with them.
[14/03/2023, 04:04:22] Alex Regueiro: Also, I'm not sure I ever saw this when I was there. At that point in my life it really should have been a place of pilgrimage.
[14/03/2023, 04:04:33] Alex Regueiro: Oh right, nice. Thinking of applying?
[14/03/2023, 04:04:47] Alice Lafferty: At Harris Manchester college (?) I think
[14/03/2023, 04:04:54] Alice Lafferty: Yeah
[14/03/2023, 04:04:59] Alex Regueiro: Presume this wasn't the time you were stuck at the London train station and texted me...
[14/03/2023, 04:05:24] Alice Lafferty: ü§î I don't remember now. We did go by train.
[14/03/2023, 04:06:31] Alex Regueiro: Cool. What for? Tell him from me that Cambridge sucks! And that Oxford is the much better option if you're only really interested in one science... a lesson I learnt too late.
[14/03/2023, 04:08:05] Alice Lafferty: But anyway, sorry for not being able to respond fully to the paper.. I will hopefully come back to it, also I'd like you to say more about evolution specifically being negentropic (or, whatever random definition I've now given that word..)
[14/03/2023, 04:08:32] Alice Lafferty: Ha, I actually have to kind of agree with you.. I couldn't honestly recommend him Cambridge.
[14/03/2023, 04:08:54] Alex Regueiro: Actually that was maybe three weeks ago, before you deleted WhatsApp. I just remember you lamenting the being stuck in a busy train station, and sympathising because I'd had some nasty journeys into London lately (on the Tube though).
[14/03/2023, 04:09:24] Alice Lafferty: He's thinking PPE at the momentüò¨
[14/03/2023, 04:09:44] Alex Regueiro: Yes, I want to think about that more too. But stop apologising! It's really quite alright. Just message me when inspiration strikes.
[14/03/2023, 04:10:15] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, I think that was the same day I randomly bristled in the group chat and started arguing with everyone's perfectly legitimate points...
[14/03/2023, 04:10:21] Alice Lafferty: About domestic abuse
[14/03/2023, 04:11:09] Alice Lafferty: It's kind of good to take oppositional stance sometimes but I don't think that was the right forum maybe.
[14/03/2023, 04:11:28] Alex Regueiro: I'm sure Cambridge is objectively better for many things, though if your interest within natural science is overwhelmingly in physics, and you already know that... Also, I think I prefer Oxford as a town, even though I'd take trips to Cambridge with the family as a kid, never Oxford!
[14/03/2023, 04:12:00] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah, and vice versa for me.
[14/03/2023, 04:12:13] Alice Lafferty: Besides the colleges, I thought the high street etc in Oxford was quite ordinary..
[14/03/2023, 04:12:50] Alice Lafferty: I think we used to go to more Abingdon area.
[14/03/2023, 04:12:58] Alex Regueiro: Haha I was going to say, I remembered you disagreeing with one or two comments in the group chat too, at the same time... but you then went AWOL, so it remained a bristling and not an argument.
[14/03/2023, 04:13:13] Alex Regueiro: And hey, there is plenty of bristling in that group. And I mean plenty.
[14/03/2023, 04:13:26] Alex Regueiro: You're pretty much the least of the culprits.
[14/03/2023, 04:13:48] Alice Lafferty: I get seized with the desire to go to bat for some specific belief even if I don't particularly hold it... like I did with libertarianism a few weeks ago too.
[14/03/2023, 04:13:55] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, St Giles is a fair bit nicer, and other streets too
[14/03/2023, 04:14:10] Alice Lafferty: *Although I do semi-believe in that
[14/03/2023, 04:14:21] Alex Regueiro: The Cambridge High Street is downright ugly though, in large parts. From what I recall. Lots of 60s concrete structures and jarringly incongruous architecture.
[14/03/2023, 04:15:19] Alex Regueiro: Radiohead ü§òüèº
[14/03/2023, 04:15:34] Alex Regueiro: Never been mind you. What's there?
[14/03/2023, 04:16:04] Alice Lafferty: My cousins haha
[14/03/2023, 04:16:16] Alice Lafferty: Not really much I don't think, it's a nice commuter town.
[14/03/2023, 04:17:14] Alex Regueiro: Hah yes. Which is totally fair. It's tempting on occasion to oversell your own subscription to some ideology... even just to be provocative. üòâ
[14/03/2023, 04:17:23] Alex Regueiro: oh fair
[14/03/2023, 04:18:09] Alice Lafferty: It was an interesting group in any case
[14/03/2023, 04:18:19] Alice Lafferty: * is I mean obviously

[14/03/2023, 04:20:19] Alice Lafferty: Didn't really help my cognition though.
[14/03/2023, 04:20:39] Alex Regueiro: Phew. Almost thought you planned to dispose of us for a minute!
[14/03/2023, 04:21:03] Alice Lafferty: Also sorry if I'm keeping you up
[14/03/2023, 04:21:25] Alex Regueiro: Rat us out petulantly to the Grauniad like two of the first members who realised it wasn't what they were hoping for.
[14/03/2023, 04:21:29] Alex Regueiro: (I made have already said that?)
[14/03/2023, 04:22:02] Alice Lafferty: Oh yes I remember you telling me about this incident.
[14/03/2023, 04:22:19] Alex Regueiro: That's impressive, even if I don't much trust the iPhone's pedometer. Least of all your archaic model eh.
[14/03/2023, 04:22:49] Alex Regueiro: And "interesting" is a fair part-truth part-euphemism üòâ
[14/03/2023, 04:22:53] Alice Lafferty: Still incredible because there was nothing really objectionable being said.
[14/03/2023, 04:23:19] Alex Regueiro: In the article? Yeah it was really a nothing piece
[14/03/2023, 04:23:24] Alex Regueiro: Don't think anyone paid much attention to it
[14/03/2023, 04:23:42] Alice Lafferty: I measured it against a wearable pedometer my dad claimed to be highly accurate (üôÑ), and it actually performed ok.
[14/03/2023, 04:23:50] Alex Regueiro: It was just, "ooh, these guys have some tangential link to Toby Young, who's a bit controversial"
[14/03/2023, 04:23:52] Alice Lafferty: That is 5km.
[14/03/2023, 04:24:05] Alex Regueiro: Hah trust you to do that.
[14/03/2023, 04:24:12] Alex Regueiro: But actually good to know
[14/03/2023, 04:24:51] Alice Lafferty: I like my ancient iphone... as I think we proved, the camera on your iPhone 282737 or whatever was not particularly better!
[14/03/2023, 04:25:03] Alex Regueiro: Only iPhone 12!
[14/03/2023, 04:25:07] Alex Regueiro: I'm two models behind now
[14/03/2023, 04:25:21] Alex Regueiro: But my bank account thanks me for the SIM-only contract
[14/03/2023, 04:25:31] Alex Regueiro: almost 3
[14/03/2023, 04:25:53] Alice Lafferty: There's not an iPhone 15?? What possible incremental improvements can they make...
[14/03/2023, 04:25:58] Alex Regueiro: I thought we established the tone/brightness sensitivity was notably better on mine?
[14/03/2023, 04:26:36] Alice Lafferty: Hmmmmm
[14/03/2023, 04:26:39] Alex Regueiro: But yeah, I'm just being contrary. Your phone is perfectly good 99% of the time.
[14/03/2023, 04:27:49] Alex Regueiro: A gazillion megapixel quad-camera with 100x optical zoom? You can only take one photo before your drive is full, but hey, it's a damn good photo!
[14/03/2023, 04:28:00] Alice Lafferty: If memory serves... inevitably I'm going to go and try and find the picture I took and find it's basically a blurry smudge

[14/03/2023, 04:28:42] Alex Regueiro: Hah no
[14/03/2023, 04:29:33] Alice Lafferty: Do you remember the date?
[14/03/2023, 04:30:08] Alex Regueiro: No, but Apple reliably informs me it was the 26th Jan.

[14/03/2023, 04:31:50] Alex Regueiro: Honestly doesn't surprise me
[14/03/2023, 04:32:04] Alice Lafferty: Ok whatever maybe yours is betterüòí
[14/03/2023, 04:32:05] Alex Regueiro: Cheeky in a sense, but a lot of fuss about nothing all the same?
[14/03/2023, 04:32:22] Alex Regueiro: Victory!
[14/03/2023, 04:32:32] Alice Lafferty: Hm maybe, I think the problem was the marketing was a bit misleading.
[14/03/2023, 04:32:39] Alex Regueiro: But to be honest yours isn't as bad as I recalled... maybe your screen didn't do it a favour either?
[14/03/2023, 04:32:54] Alice Lafferty: Now you're insulting my screen.....
[14/03/2023, 04:33:59] Alice Lafferty: It captures quite a lot of detail in daylight and otherwise I don't really care
[14/03/2023, 04:34:46] Alex Regueiro: Frankly you're lucky I'm friends with someone with such a dinosaur phone! üôÑ
[14/03/2023, 04:35:01] Alex Regueiro: I don't know why I'm acting like one of the Mean Girls character...
[14/03/2023, 04:35:04] Alex Regueiro: Anyway!
[14/03/2023, 04:35:39] Alice Lafferty: I guess if some aspects of the photo are artificial, it sort of frustrates the usual aim of photography to accurately record reality, and so on from there...
[14/03/2023, 04:35:41] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I don't think I ever had cause to complain in advance of actually upgrading, when I noticed the difference. Maybe just in the dark.
[14/03/2023, 04:36:01] Alice Lafferty: Ha!
[14/03/2023, 04:36:10] Alice Lafferty: Or the nominal aim at least
[14/03/2023, 04:36:19] Alex Regueiro: I doubt your average iPhone user takes photography so seriously, but I agree with the principle.
[14/03/2023, 04:36:44] Alex Regueiro: Regardless, it's still a minor scandal after Apple were found to be artificially constraining battery life in old iPhone models.
[14/03/2023, 04:36:48] Alice Lafferty: Yes probably true
[14/03/2023, 04:36:49] Alex Regueiro: That's pretty evil
[14/03/2023, 04:37:01] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah!
[14/03/2023, 04:37:17] Alex Regueiro: And I don't mean the venial sort...
[14/03/2023, 04:37:19] Alice Lafferty: Do you remember which model(s) that affected?
[14/03/2023, 04:37:42] Alex Regueiro: I think all, until the scandal was exposed? I mean as soon as they released a new phone, they'd flip the switch on older models.
[14/03/2023, 04:37:44] Alice Lafferty: My battery is _quite_ bad, but doesn't make it really unusable for a day trip or something like that.
[14/03/2023, 04:37:59] Alex Regueiro: They had to pay out quite a lot, if I remember right. Class-action suit
[14/03/2023, 04:38:19] Alex Regueiro: Yes, you're not exactly glued to phone, to your credit. I mean, from what I can tell!
[14/03/2023, 04:39:22] Alex Regueiro: I mean, if you're regularly exhausting your battery in a day, the problem is problem your habits more than the phone, right?
[14/03/2023, 04:40:05] Alice Lafferty: Maybe. Also I keep it on airplane mode/location off which I'm telling you drastically improves battery life.
[14/03/2023, 04:40:15] Alice Lafferty: Sorry replied to wrong message
[14/03/2023, 04:40:15] Alex Regueiro: Then again you can get yourself a Nokia 3310 with a one week battery life. üôåüèº
[14/03/2023, 04:40:28] Alex Regueiro: Yeah I do the same
[14/03/2023, 04:40:58] Alex Regueiro: My mum doesn't use her phone a lot but she was getting super frustrated by the battery life until I told her that.
[14/03/2023, 04:41:31] Alice Lafferty: Sounds good, except for one specific thing, which is access to google maps when outside.
[14/03/2023, 04:41:54] Alice Lafferty: When I think about it that's the main use of my mobile data.
[14/03/2023, 04:41:57] Alex Regueiro: Especially if you're underground, as it will keep searching for networks and suck the life out of it quicker than a vampire.
[14/03/2023, 04:42:00] Alex Regueiro: Yeah
[14/03/2023, 04:42:25] Alex Regueiro: Google Maps is utterly invaluable when you have the directional sense that I do..
[14/03/2023, 04:42:44] Alice Lafferty: It's nice to delight middle aged people with stuff like this.
[14/03/2023, 04:42:53] Alice Lafferty: It is for me too.
[14/03/2023, 04:43:27] Alice Lafferty: I was thinking about interesting a trait that is considering you have otherwise very good spatial abilities.
[14/03/2023, 04:43:30] Alex Regueiro: I know. I feel so clever momentarily. Then I realise I'm their live-in technical support as long as I'm staying with them, hrmph!
[14/03/2023, 04:44:02] Alex Regueiro: Then I realise I'm still getting a very good deal for room and board, economically...
[14/03/2023, 04:44:04] Alice Lafferty: In terms of 'ability to rotate shapes in your head' kind of thing. You'd think those abilities all come as a package.
[14/03/2023, 04:44:16] Alex Regueiro: Do I? üëÄ
[14/03/2023, 04:44:20] Alex Regueiro: Ah
[14/03/2023, 04:44:49] Alex Regueiro: Yes... I've had similar thoughts. It's curious.
[14/03/2023, 04:45:12] Alice Lafferty: Haha exactly, I jump quickly to it when my parents ask me to fix something/make a cup of tea etc..
[14/03/2023, 04:46:19] Alex Regueiro: Of all the Oxford mathematicians on my course I somehow had the least bad directional sense, we established on our first evening out. Frankly it boggles the mind.
[14/03/2023, 04:46:34] Alice Lafferty: Maybe numeracy/mathematical abstraction is slightly different. Although I had thought the two were strongly associated.
[14/03/2023, 04:46:41] Alice Lafferty: That's really interesting
[14/03/2023, 04:46:51] Alex Regueiro: Visual and spatial intelligence are quite distinct, as I understand
[14/03/2023, 04:47:38] Alex Regueiro: But yes, I think different mathematicians often use different cortexes. There's a really nice anecdote about mathematicians multitasking (from the Erdos biography I read?).
[14/03/2023, 04:47:48] Alice Lafferty: Spatial ability is like the archetypal masculine cognitive trait, I believe there was a whole book in the 90s trading on 'Women not being able to read maps'
[14/03/2023, 04:47:54] Alice Lafferty: I can't find it.
[14/03/2023, 04:47:54] Alex Regueiro: Oh you're such a good daughter!
[14/03/2023, 04:48:52] Alice Lafferty: Different from say, engineers?
[14/03/2023, 04:49:47] Alice Lafferty: Only mentioned this because it seems these traits cluster
[14/03/2023, 04:49:50] Alex Regueiro: I'm usually far more begrudging. Bribery will do the trick though! Maybe the years have just worn me down...
[14/03/2023, 04:51:29] Alex Regueiro: My parents would mention to their friends that I was some sort of tech whizz, and thus really stitch me up! I must have troubleshooted issues for 80% of them over the years. üò©
[14/03/2023, 04:51:37] Alex Regueiro: Let me find the quote...
[14/03/2023, 04:51:57] Alex Regueiro: Interesting. I think I've heard the same but didn't lend much credence to it.
[14/03/2023, 04:53:22] Alice Lafferty: Oh yeah I can imagine! Even a slight reputation can get you roped into loads of stuff
[14/03/2023, 04:53:32] Alice Lafferty: Kind of fair in your case though probably!
[14/03/2023, 04:55:10] Alice Lafferty: I'm just talking aloud here now but Apple should do a feature that allows you to make word searches for text in images.
[14/03/2023, 04:55:16] Alex Regueiro: Grr, I didn't save that quote when I was reading the book
[14/03/2023, 04:55:38] Alice Lafferty: I've got literally hundreds of screenshots of text/quotes and obviously can never find what I'm looking for!
[14/03/2023, 04:56:26] Alex Regueiro: Anyway it basically showed that some people (mathematicians specifically) use their visual cortex when counting, and others use their auditory cortex, and this was reflected in their ability to multitask. i.e. They could do a visual-oriented and audio-oriented task simultaneously fairly well, but not two of the same kind!
[14/03/2023, 04:56:39] Alex Regueiro: Wait, or maybe it was in the Feynman biography?
[14/03/2023, 04:56:57] Alex Regueiro: Anyway one of the maths/physics geniuses did an informal experiment with his colleagues.
[14/03/2023, 04:57:00] Alice Lafferty: Oh that sounds really interesting. Please let me know if you find/remember the source.
[14/03/2023, 04:57:01] Alex Regueiro: Alas...
[14/03/2023, 04:57:15] Alex Regueiro: üò†
[14/03/2023, 04:57:41] Alex Regueiro: Don't they have that now? Or is the text just selectable, not searchable?
[14/03/2023, 04:57:45] Alex Regueiro: I agree in any case
[14/03/2023, 04:58:07] Alice Lafferty: Yeah just selectable... but it shouldn't be a huge leap.
[14/03/2023, 04:58:33] Alice Lafferty: Do you think something similar applies to word processing?
[14/03/2023, 04:58:52] Alice Lafferty: Just reading that, it's not immediately obvious to me which category I fall into.
[14/03/2023, 04:59:02] Alex Regueiro: Probably the Feynman biography actually. Will do.
[14/03/2023, 04:59:08] Alex Regueiro: Certainly
[14/03/2023, 05:00:17] Alex Regueiro: I've wondered the same, and I reckon so. I think with language ability generally. My visual (and spatial?) ability is definitely stronger overall, but for language I'm almost entirely auditory. Thus I'm pretty bad at things like anagrams.
[14/03/2023, 05:00:23] Alex Regueiro: I'd be curious...
[14/03/2023, 05:01:00] Alice Lafferty: Interesting. We both seem to have that problem where we accidentally substitute similar-sounding words.
[14/03/2023, 05:01:05] Alex Regueiro: Oh here it is. üôÇ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj4y0EUlU-Y
[14/03/2023, 05:01:27] Alex Regueiro: That might have been recounted in the biography too.
[14/03/2023, 05:01:44] Alice Lafferty: Thank you!
[14/03/2023, 05:01:59] Alex Regueiro: Hah yeah, I'd say you're mainly auditory too, when it comes to language.
[14/03/2023, 05:02:10] Alice Lafferty: How does one even do maths problems 'auditorarily'
[14/03/2023, 05:02:17] Alice Lafferty: *auditorily (?)
[14/03/2023, 05:02:22] Alice Lafferty: Aurally
[14/03/2023, 05:03:32] Alice Lafferty: Did you tend to find say algebra or geometry easier out of interest?
[14/03/2023, 05:03:58] Alex Regueiro: God, it's too late for me to decide... And let's definitely not debate the correct pronunciation of "aurally"!
[14/03/2023, 05:04:14] Alice Lafferty: Haha sorry!
[14/03/2023, 05:04:26] Alice Lafferty: It is not even late now, it's early.
[14/03/2023, 05:04:26] Alex Regueiro: I'm just ribbing you!
[14/03/2023, 05:04:51] Alex Regueiro: It's in that horrible grey zone... but I say late, because it's not even tomorrow until I go to bed and wake up!
[14/03/2023, 05:05:00] Alex Regueiro: Probably algebra, though good question. I'm really not sure
[14/03/2023, 05:05:01] Alex Regueiro: You?
[14/03/2023, 05:05:50] Alice Lafferty: Same. Trying to tease out a possible difference between 'spatial ability' and  'numeracy', although I'm not sure this is the right way.
[14/03/2023, 05:06:25] Alice Lafferty: Also geometry was largely just algebra problems presented differently as I remember it.
[14/03/2023, 05:06:42] Alice Lafferty: Maybe something like topology would be more relevant.
[14/03/2023, 05:06:51] Alex Regueiro: I'm going to go to bed now actually. The melatonin in my brain has finally compensated for the stimulation of reading the paper and the intellectual discussion... as fun as it was!
[14/03/2023, 05:07:04] Alex Regueiro: Yeah, that's Cartesian geometry for you
[14/03/2023, 05:07:17] Alex Regueiro: makes the two almost interchangeable
[14/03/2023, 05:07:21] Alice Lafferty: Of course
[14/03/2023, 05:07:34] Alex Regueiro: I'm not sure what the archetypal examples of those abilities are to be honest...
[14/03/2023, 05:07:58] Alice Lafferty: Just as my brain is warming up obviously..
[14/03/2023, 05:08:14] Alice Lafferty: They may not even be distinct.
[14/03/2023, 05:08:17] Alex Regueiro: Okay, because I was looking through this album trying to find the quote, I'm going to leave you with these snippets from The Man Who Loved Only Numbers (the Paul Erdos biography)
[14/03/2023, 05:09:03] Alex Regueiro: I think visual ability is a fundamental/primitive one but numerical possibly isn't, and depends on the person in question? The little Feynman video seems to support that.
[14/03/2023, 05:09:39] Alice Lafferty: Oh righf I haven't watched it yet.
